title={Continuous monitoring of patients in and after the acute admission ward to improve clinical pathways: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (Optimal-AAW)},
abstract={BackgroundBecause of high demand on hospital beds, hospitals seek to reduce patients’ length of stay (LOS) while preserving the quality of care. In addition to usual intermittent vital sign monitoring, continuous monitoring might help to assess the patient’s risk of deterioration, in order to improve the discharge process and reduce LOS. The primary aim of this monocenter randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of continuous monitoring in an acute admission ward (AAW) on the percentage of patients who are discharged safely.MethodsA total of 800 patients admitted to the AAW, for whom it is equivocal whether they can be discharged directly after their AAW stay, will be randomized to either receive usual care without (control group) or with additional continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate, posture, and activity, using a wearable sensor (sensor group). Continuous monitoring data are provided to healthcare professionals and used in the discharge decision. The wearable sensor keeps collecting data for 14 days. After 14 days, all patients fill in a questionnaire to assess healthcare use after discharge and, if applicable, their experience with the wearable sensor. The primary outcome is the difference in the percentage of patients who are safely discharged home directly from the AAW between the control and sensor group. Secondary outcomes include hospital LOS, AAW LOS, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, Rapid Response Team calls, and unplanned readmissions within 30 days. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers for implementing continuous monitoring in the AAW and at home will be investigated.DiscussionClinical effects of continuous monitoring have already been investigated in specific patient populations for multiple purposes, e.g., in reducing the number of ICU admissions. However, to our knowledge, this is the first Randomized Controlled Trial to investigate effects of continuous monitoring in a broad patient population in the AAW.Trial registrationhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05181111.

title={The different contributions of the eight prefrontal cortex subregions to reactive responses after unpredictable slip perturbations and vibrotactile cueing},
abstract={Recent advancements in functional near-infrared spectroscopy technology have offered a portable, wireless, wearable solution to measure activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the human neuroscience field. This study is the first to validate the different contributions made by the PFC’s eight subregions in healthy young adults to the reactive recovery responses following treadmill-induced unpredictable slip perturbations and vibrotactile cueing (i.e., precues). Our fall-inducing technology platform equipped with a split-belt treadmill provided unpredictable slip perturbations to healthy young adults while walking at their self-selected walking speed. A portable, wireless, wearable, and multi-channel (48 channels) functional near-infrared spectroscopy system evaluated the activity of PFC’s eight subregions (i.e., right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC); frontopolar prefrontal cortex (FPFC); and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)) as quantified by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations. A motion capture system and two force plates beneath the split-belt treadmill were used to quantify participants’ kinematic and kinetic behavior. All participants completed 6 trials: 2 consecutive trials without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (control trials); 3 trials with vibrotactile cueing (2 trials with the slip perturbation (cueing trial) and 1 trial without the slip perturbation (catch trial); and 1 trial without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (post-control trial). The PFC subregions’ activity and kinematic behavior were assessed during the three periods (i.e., standing, walking, and recovery periods). Compared to the walkers’ standing and walking periods, recovery periods showed significantly higher and lower levels of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, respectively, in the right and left DLPFC, VLPFC, and FPFC, regardless of the presence of vibrotactile cueing. However, there was no significant difference in the right and left OFC between the three periods. Kinematic analyses confirmed that vibrotactile cueing significantly improved reactive recovery responses without requiring more involvement by the PFC subregions, which suggests that the sum of attentional resources is similar in cued and non-cued motor responses. The results could inform the design of wearable technologies that alert their users to the risks of falling and assist with the development of new gait perturbation paradigms that prompt reactive responses.},

abstract={Recent advancements in functional near-infrared spectroscopy technology have offered a portable, wireless, wearable solution to measure activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the human neuroscience field. This study is the first to validate the different contributions made by the PFC’s eight subregions in healthy young adults to the reactive recovery responses following treadmill-induced unpredictable slip perturbations and vibrotactile cueing (i.e., precues). Our fall-inducing technology platform equipped with a split-belt treadmill provided unpredictable slip perturbations to healthy young adults while walking at their self-selected walking speed. A portable, wireless, wearable, and multi-channel (48 channels) functional near-infrared spectroscopy system evaluated the activity of PFC’s eight subregions (i.e., right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC); frontopolar prefrontal cortex (FPFC); and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)) as quantified by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations. A motion capture system and two force plates beneath the split-belt treadmill were used to quantify participants’ kinematic and kinetic behavior. All participants completed 6 trials: 2 consecutive trials without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (control trials); 3 trials with vibrotactile cueing (2 trials with the slip perturbation (cueing trial) and 1 trial without the slip perturbation (catch trial); and 1 trial without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (post-control trial). The PFC subregions’ activity and kinematic behavior were assessed during the three periods (i.e., standing, walking, and recovery periods). Compared to the walkers’ standing and walking periods, recovery periods showed significantly higher and lower levels of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, respectively, in the right and left DLPFC, VLPFC, and FPFC, regardless of the presence of vibrotactile cueing. However, there was no significant difference in the right and left OFC between the three periods. Kinematic analyses confirmed that vibrotactile cueing significantly improved reactive recovery responses without requiring more involvement by the PFC subregions, which suggests that the sum of attentional resources is similar in cued and non-cued motor responses. The results could inform the design of wearable technologies that alert their users to the risks of falling and assist with the development of new gait perturbation paradigms that prompt reactive responses.},

A portable, wireless, wearable, and multi-channel (48 channels) functional near-infrared spectroscopy system evaluated the activity of PFC’s eight subregions (i.e., right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC); frontopolar prefrontal cortex (FPFC); and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)) as quantified by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations. A motion capture system and two force plates beneath the split-belt treadmill were used to quantify participants’ kinematic and kinetic behavior. All participants completed 6 trials: 2 consecutive trials without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (control trials); 3 trials with vibrotactile cueing (2 trials with the slip perturbation (cueing trial) and 1 trial without the slip perturbation (catch trial); and 1 trial without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (post-control trial). The PFC subregions’ activity and kinematic behavior were assessed during the three periods (i.e., standing, walking, and recovery periods). Compared to the walkers’ standing and walking periods, recovery periods showed significantly higher and lower levels of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, respectively, in the right and left DLPFC, VLPFC, and FPFC, regardless of the presence of vibrotactile cueing. However, there was no significant difference in the right and left OFC between the three periods. Kinematic analyses confirmed that vibrotactile cueing significantly improved reactive recovery responses without requiring more involvement by the PFC subregions, which suggests that the sum of attentional resources is similar in cued and non-cued motor responses. The results could inform the design of wearable technologies that alert their users to the risks of falling and assist with the development of new gait perturbation paradigms that prompt reactive responses.},

title={Mitochondrial dynamics modulate the allergic inflammation in a murine model of allergic rhinitis},
abstract={ObjectiveAllergic rhinitis (AR) is a common allergic disorder, afflicting thousands of human beings. Aberrant mitochondrial dynamics are important pathological elements for various immune cell dysfunctions and allergic diseases. However, the connection between mitochondrial dynamics and AR remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether mitochondrial dynamics influence the inflammatory response in AR.MethodsIn the present study, we established a murine model of AR by sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA). Then, we investigated the mitochondrial morphology in mice with AR by transmission electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy, and evaluated the role of Mdivi-1 (an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission) on allergic symptoms, inflammatory responses, allergic-related signals, and reactive oxygen species formation.ResultsThere was a notable enhancement in mitochondrial fragmentation in the nasal mucosa of mice following OVA stimulation, whereas Mdivi-1 prevented aberrant mitochondrial morphology. Indeed, Mdivi-1 alleviated the rubbing and sneezing responses in OVA-sensitized mice. Compared with vehicle-treated ones, mice treated with Mdivi-1 exhibited a reduction in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and specific IgE levels in both serum and nasal lavage fluid, and shown an amelioration in inflammatory response of nasal mucosa. Meanwhile, Mdivi-1 treatment was associated with a suppression in JAK2 and STAT6 activation and reactive oxygen species generation, which act as important signaling for allergic response.ConclusionOur findings reveal mitochondrial dynamics modulate the allergic responses in AR.

abstract={COVID-19 has impacted the healthcare system across the globe. The study will span three pandemic waves in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The goal is to learn how the pandemic affects antenatal care (ANC) and emergency delivery care for pregnant women in Tamil Nadu, India, and how medical services respond. The study employs counterfactual analysis to evaluate the causal impact of the pandemic. A feedforward in combination with a simple auto-regressive neural network (AR-Net) is used to predict the daily number of calls for ambulance services (CAS). Three categories of the daily CAS count between January 2016 and December 2022 are utilised. The total CAS includes all types of medical emergencies; the second group pertains to planned ANC for high-risk pregnant women and the third group comprises CAS from pregnant women for medical emergencies. The second wave’s infection and mortality rates were up to six times higher than the first. The phases in wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III experienced a significant increase in both total IFT (inter-facility transfer) and total non-IFT calls covering all emergencies relative to the counterfactual, as evidenced by reported effect sizes of 1 and a range of 0.65 to 0.85, respectively. This highlights overwhelmed health services. In Tamil Nadu, neither emergency prenatal care nor planned prenatal care was affected by the pandemic. In contrast, the increase in actual emergency-related IFT calls during wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III was 62%, 160%, 141%, and 165%, respectively, relative to the counterfactual. During the same time periods, the mean daily CAS related to prenatal care increased by 47%, 51%, 38%, and 38%, respectively, compared to pre-pandemic levels. The expansion of ambulance services and increased awareness of these services during wave II and the ensuing phases of Covid-19 pandemic have enhanced emergency care delivery for all, including obstetric and neonatal cohorts.},

abstract={COVID-19 has impacted the healthcare system across the globe. The study will span three pandemic waves in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The goal is to learn how the pandemic affects antenatal care (ANC) and emergency delivery care for pregnant women in Tamil Nadu, India, and how medical services respond. The study employs counterfactual analysis to evaluate the causal impact of the pandemic.

The study employs counterfactual analysis to evaluate the causal impact of the pandemic. A feedforward in combination with a simple auto-regressive neural network (AR-Net) is used to predict the daily number of calls for ambulance services (CAS). Three categories of the daily CAS count between January 2016 and December 2022 are utilised. The total CAS includes all types of medical emergencies; the second group pertains to planned ANC for high-risk pregnant women and the third group comprises CAS from pregnant women for medical emergencies. The second wave’s infection and mortality rates were up to six times higher than the first. The phases in wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III experienced a significant increase in both total IFT (inter-facility transfer) and total non-IFT calls covering all emergencies relative to the counterfactual, as evidenced by reported effect sizes of 1 and a range of 0.65 to 0.85, respectively. This highlights overwhelmed health services. In Tamil Nadu, neither emergency prenatal care nor planned prenatal care was affected by the pandemic. In contrast, the increase in actual emergency-related IFT calls during wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III was 62%, 160%, 141%, and 165%, respectively, relative to the counterfactual. During the same time periods, the mean daily CAS related to prenatal care increased by 47%, 51%, 38%, and 38%, respectively, compared to pre-pandemic levels. The expansion of ambulance services and increased awareness of these services during wave II and the ensuing phases of Covid-19 pandemic have enhanced emergency care delivery for all, including obstetric and neonatal cohorts.},

There were few physician differences in reported practices across patient demographics (sex and race), clinical complexity, and alert frequency of the clinical case.ConclusionsIn hypothetical cases of patients presenting without clinical symptoms, physicians opted for further diagnostic testing and often to medical intervention based on Apple Watch irregular rhythm notifications. There was also considerable variation across physician specialties, suggesting a need for uniform clinical practice guidelines.

title={Extended reality as a training method for medical first responders in mass casualty incidents: A protocol for a systematic review},
abstract={Introduction/Background Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) and disasters require an organised and effective response from medical first responders (MFRs). As such, novel training methods have emerged to prepare and adequately train MFRs for these challenging situations. Particular focus should be placed on extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR, AR, and MR, respectively), and allows participants to develop high-quality skills in realistic and immersive environments. Given the rapid evolution of high-fidelity simulation technology and its advantages, XR simulation has become a promising tool for emergency medicine. Accordingly, this systematic review aims to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of XR training methods and 2) explore the experience of MFRs undergoing such training. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will encompass four distinct themes: MFRs, disasters/MCIs, education and simulation, and XR. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACs) will be searched along with an in-depth examination of the grey literature and reference lists of relevant articles.

Given the predicted high heterogeneity between studies, it may not be possible to standardise data for quantitative comparison and meta-analysis.

title={First Responder Virtual Reality Simulator to train and assess emergency personnel for mass casualty response},
abstract={Introduction/Background Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) and disasters require an organised and effective response from medical first responders (MFRs). As such, novel training methods have emerged to prepare and adequately train MFRs for these challenging situations. Particular focus should be placed on extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR, AR, and MR, respectively), and allows participants to develop high-quality skills in realistic and immersive environments. Given the rapid evolution of high-fidelity simulation technology and its advantages, XR simulation has become a promising tool for emergency medicine. Accordingly, this systematic review aims to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of XR training methods and 2) explore the experience of MFRs undergoing such training. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will encompass four distinct themes: MFRs, disasters/MCIs, education and simulation, and XR. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACs) will be searched along with an in-depth examination of the grey literature and reference lists of relevant articles. MetaQAT will be used as a study quality assessment tool and integrated into Covidence as part of the data extraction form. Given the predicted high heterogeneity between studies, it may not be possible to standardise data for quantitative comparison and meta-analysis. Thus, data will be synthesised in a narrative, semi-quantitative manner. Discussion This review will examine the existing literature on the effectiveness of XR simulation as a tool to train MFRs for MCIs, which could ultimately improve preparedness and response to disasters.

abstract={As mass casualty incidents continue to escalate in the United States, we must improve frontline responder performance to increase the odds of victim survival. In this article, we describe the First Responder Virtual Reality Simulator, a high-fidelity, fully immersive, automated, programmable virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to train frontline responders to treat and triage victims of mass casualty incidents. First responder trainees don a wireless VR head-mounted display linked to a compatible desktop computer. Trainees see and hear autonomous, interactive victims who are programmed to simulate individuals with injuries consistent with an explosion in an underground space. Armed with a virtual medical kit, responders are tasked with triaging and treating the victims on the scene. The VR environment can be made more challenging by increasing the environmental chaos, adding patients, or increasing the acuity of patient injuries. The VR platform tracks and records their performance as they navigate the disaster scene. Output from the system provides feedback to participants on their performance. Eventually, we hope that the First Responder system will serve both as an effective replacement for expensive conventional training methods as well as a safe and efficient platform for research on current triage protocols.},

The VR environment can be made more challenging by increasing the environmental chaos, adding patients, or increasing the acuity of patient injuries. The VR platform tracks and records their performance as they navigate the disaster scene. Output from the system provides feedback to participants on their performance. Eventually, we hope that the First Responder system will serve both as an effective replacement for expensive conventional training methods as well as a safe and efficient platform for research on current triage protocols.},

abstract={BackgroundAlcohol withdrawal syndrome, if untreated, can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We aimed to compare the symptoms-triggered approach and fixed-dose approach of benzodiazepine administration for treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in regard to the health care utilization measured by the total dose of benzodiazepines, length of hospital stays, and 90-day readmissions rate.MethodsA single-center prospective non-randomized controlled trial included all patients diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The group of patients admitted between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020, were treated with the fixed-scheduled approach (n = 150), while all patients admitted between November 1, 2020, to October 31, 2021, were treated with the symptoms-trigger approach (n = 50).ResultsThe fixed-dose approach group showed a significant higher 90-day readmissions rate (HR: 2.61; 95% CI = 1.18, 6.84; p = 0.01). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter duration to the first readmission in the fixed-scheduled approach group (HR: 2.3; 95% CI = 5.6, 1.16; p = 0.02). The symptoms-triggered approach group required a significantly lower dose of diazepam (40 mg vs. 10 mg; p < 0.01) and a higher dose of thiamine (800 mg vs. 600 mg; p < 0.01). Length of hospital stay was significantly increased in the symptoms-triggered approach group (3.9 vs. 2.2 days; p < 0.01).DiscussionThe use of a symptoms-triggered approach to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome was associated with a lower 90-day readmission rate, prolonged period to the first readmission, and reduced total dose of benzodiazepines, but longer length of hospital stays.ConclusionThe symptoms-triggered approach is safe, cost-effective, and associated with reduced alcohol dependence relapse.},

Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We aimed to compare the symptoms-triggered approach and fixed-dose approach of benzodiazepine administration for treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in regard to the health care utilization measured by the total dose of benzodiazepines, length of hospital stays, and 90-day readmissions rate.MethodsA single-center prospective non-randomized controlled trial included all patients diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The group of patients admitted between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020, were treated with the fixed-scheduled approach (n = 150), while all patients admitted between November 1, 2020, to October 31, 2021, were treated with the symptoms-trigger approach (n = 50).ResultsThe fixed-dose approach group showed a significant higher 90-day readmissions rate (HR: 2.61; 95% CI = 1.18, 6.84; p = 0.01). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter duration to the first readmission in the fixed-scheduled approach group (HR: 2.3; 95% CI = 5.6, 1.16; p = 0.02). The symptoms-triggered approach group required a significantly lower dose of diazepam (40 mg vs. 10 mg; p < 0.01) and a higher dose of thiamine (800 mg vs. 600 mg; p < 0.01). Length of hospital stay was significantly increased in the symptoms-triggered approach group (3.9 vs. 2.2 days; p < 0.01).DiscussionThe use of a symptoms-triggered approach to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome was associated with a lower 90-day readmission rate, prolonged period to the first readmission, and reduced total dose of benzodiazepines, but longer length of hospital stays.ConclusionThe symptoms-triggered approach is safe, cost-effective, and associated with reduced alcohol dependence relapse.},

title={Bactericidal Activity of Silver-Doped Chitosan Coatings via Electrophoretic Deposition on Ti6Al4V Additively Manufactured Substrates},
abstract={Prosthetic reconstruction can serve as a feasible alternative, delivering both functional and aesthetic benefits to individuals with hand and finger injuries, frequent causes of emergency room visits. Implant-related infections pose significant challenges in arthroplasty and osteosynthesis procedures, contributing to surgical failures. As a potential solution to this challenge, this study developed a new class of silver (Ag)-doped chitosan (CS) coatings via electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on osseointegrated prostheses for infection therapy. These coatings were successfully applied to additively manufactured Ti6Al4V ELI samples. In the initial phase, the feasibility of the composite coating was assessed using the Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) techniques. The optimized structures exhibited impressive water uptake in the range of 300–360%. Codeposition with an antibacterial agent proved effective, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the coating morphology. Biologically, CS coatings demonstrated cytocompatibility when in direct contact with a fibroblast cell line (L929) after 72 h. When exposed to the Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (ATCC 12228), these coatings inhibited bacterial growth and biofilm formation within 24 h. These findings underscore the significant potential of this approach for various applications, including endoprostheses like hip implants, internal medical devices, and transcutaneous prostheses such as osseointegrated limb prosthetics for upper and lower extremities.},

These coatings were successfully applied to additively manufactured Ti6Al4V ELI samples. In the initial phase, the feasibility of the composite coating was assessed using the Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) techniques. The optimized structures exhibited impressive water uptake in the range of 300–360%. Codeposition with an antibacterial agent proved effective, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the coating morphology. Biologically, CS coatings demonstrated cytocompatibility when in direct contact with a fibroblast cell line (L929) after 72 h. When exposed to the Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (ATCC 12228), these coatings inhibited bacterial growth and biofilm formation within 24 h. These findings underscore the significant potential of this approach for various applications, including endoprostheses like hip implants, internal medical devices, and transcutaneous prostheses such as osseointegrated limb prosthetics for upper and lower extremities.},

title={Wearable Electrochemical Glove-Based Analytical Device (eGAD) for the Detection of Methamphetamine Employing Silver Nanoparticles},
abstract={Illicit drug misuse has become a widespread issue that requires continuous drug monitoring and diagnosis. Wearable electrochemical drug detection devices possess the potential to function as potent screening instruments in the possession of law enforcement personnel, aiding in the fight against drug trafficking and facilitating forensic investigations conducted on site. These wearable sensors are promising alternatives to traditional detection methods. In this study, we present a novel wearable electrochemical glove-based analytical device (eGAD) designed especially for detecting the club drug, methamphetamine. To develop this sensor, we immobilized meth aptamer onto silver nanoparticle (AgNPs)-modified electrodes that were printed onto latex gloves. The characteristics of AgNPs, including their shape, size and purity were analysed using FTIR, SEM and UV vis spectrometry, confirming the successful synthesis. The developed sensor shows a 0.1 µg/mL limit of detection and 0.3 µg/mL limit of quantification with a linear concentration range of about 0.01–5 µg/mL and recovery percentages of approximately 102 and 103%, respectively. To demonstrate its applicability, we tested the developed wearable sensor by spiking various alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink samples. We found that the sensor remains effective for 60 days, making it a practical option with a reasonable shelf-life. The developed sensor offers several advantages, including its affordability, ease of handling and high sensitivity and selectivity. Its portable nature makes it an ideal tool for rapid detection of METH in beverages too.},

title={Wearable Electrochemical Glove-Based Analytical Device (eGAD) for the Detection of Methamphetamine Employing Silver Nanoparticles},
abstract={Illicit drug misuse has become a widespread issue that requires continuous drug monitoring and diagnosis. Wearable electrochemical drug detection devices possess the potential to function as potent screening instruments in the possession of law enforcement personnel, aiding in the fight against drug trafficking and facilitating forensic investigations conducted on site. These wearable sensors are promising alternatives to traditional detection methods. In this study, we present a novel wearable electrochemical glove-based analytical device (eGAD) designed especially for detecting the club drug, methamphetamine. To develop this sensor, we immobilized meth aptamer onto silver nanoparticle (AgNPs)-modified electrodes that were printed onto latex gloves. The characteristics of AgNPs, including their shape, size and purity were analysed using FTIR, SEM and UV vis spectrometry, confirming the successful synthesis. The developed sensor shows a 0.1 µg/mL limit of detection and 0.3 µg/mL limit of quantification with a linear concentration range of about 0.01–5 µg/mL and recovery percentages of approximately 102 and 103%, respectively. To demonstrate its applicability, we tested the developed wearable sensor by spiking various alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink samples. We found that the sensor remains effective for 60 days, making it a practical option with a reasonable shelf-life. The developed sensor offers several advantages, including its affordability, ease of handling and high sensitivity and selectivity. Its portable nature makes it an ideal tool for rapid detection of METH in beverages too.},

The role of JCRS will vary, ranging from tasks such as radar coordination, context awareness for communication, enhanced security, increased availability, and improving the resilience and trustworthiness of future networks. In this work, the niche of JCRS technology in the future 6G ecosystem, as well as several potential applications, are discussed with a focus on RF hardware. The use of centimeter (cmWave) and millimeter (mmWave) frequency spectrums in the context of JCRS system implementation have been further elaborated. After presenting the near-term application scenarios, the circuit implementation perspectives are investigated in terms of radio frequency (RF) front-end architectures, antenna implementation, and phased arrays. Different communication and radar antenna options are compared, and the best candidates are identified. The packaging options are also presented.

title={Effect of Digital Game-Based Learning on Student Engagement and Motivation},
abstract={Currently, academia is grappling with a significant problem—a lack of engagement. Humankind has gone too far into exploring entertainment options, while the education system has not really kept up. Millennials love playing games, and this addiction can be used to engage and motivate them in the learning process. This study examines the effect of digital game-based learning on student engagement and motivation levels and the gender differences in online learning settings. This study was conducted in two distinct phases. A game-based and traditional online quizzing tools were used to compare levels of engagement and motivation, as well as to assess the additional parameter of gender difference. During the first phase of the study, 276 male and female undergraduate students were recruited from Sophomore Seminar classes, and 101 participated in the survey, of which 83 were male and 18 were female. In the second phase, 126 participants were recruited, of which 107 (63 females and 44 males) participated in the anonymous feedback surveys. The results revealed that digital game-based learning has a more positive impact on student engagement and motivation compared to traditional online activities. The incorporation of a leaderboard as a gaming element in the study was found to positively impact the academic performance of certain students, but it could also demotivate some students. Furthermore, female students generally showed a slightly higher level of enjoyment toward the games compared to male students, but they did not prefer a comparison with other students as much as male students did. The favorable response from students toward digital game-based activities indicates that enhancing instruction with such activities will not only make learning an enjoyable experience for learners but also enhance their engagement.},

title={Effect of Digital Game-Based Learning on Student Engagement and Motivation},
abstract={Currently, academia is grappling with a significant problem—a lack of engagement. Humankind has gone too far into exploring entertainment options, while the education system has not really kept up. Millennials love playing games, and this addiction can be used to engage and motivate them in the learning process. This study examines the effect of digital game-based learning on student engagement and motivation levels and the gender differences in online learning settings. This study was conducted in two distinct phases. A game-based and traditional online quizzing tools were used to compare levels of engagement and motivation, as well as to assess the additional parameter of gender difference. During the first phase of the study, 276 male and female undergraduate students were recruited from Sophomore Seminar classes, and 101 participated in the survey, of which 83 were male and 18 were female. In the second phase, 126 participants were recruited, of which 107 (63 females and 44 males) participated in the anonymous feedback surveys. The results revealed that digital game-based learning has a more positive impact on student engagement and motivation compared to traditional online activities. The incorporation of a leaderboard as a gaming element in the study was found to positively impact the academic performance of certain students, but it could also demotivate some students. Furthermore, female students generally showed a slightly higher level of enjoyment toward the games compared to male students, but they did not prefer a comparison with other students as much as male students did. The favorable response from students toward digital game-based activities indicates that enhancing instruction with such activities will not only make learning an enjoyable experience for learners but also enhance their engagement.},

title={Development of a New Wearable Device for the Characterization of Hand Tremor},
abstract={Rest tremor (RT) is observed in subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET). Electromyography (EMG) studies have shown that PD subjects exhibit alternating contractions of antagonistic muscles involved in tremors, while the contraction pattern of antagonistic muscles is synchronous in ET subjects. Therefore, the RT pattern can be used as a potential biomarker for differentiating PD from ET subjects. In this study, we developed a new wearable device and method for differentiating alternating from a synchronous RT pattern using inertial data. The novelty of our approach relies on the fact that the evaluation of synchronous or alternating tremor patterns using inertial sensors has never been described so far, and current approaches to evaluate the tremor patterns are based on surface EMG, which may be difficult to carry out for non-specialized operators. This new device, named “RT-Ring”, is based on a six-axis inertial measurement unit and a Bluetooth Low-Energy microprocessor, and can be worn on a finger of the tremulous hand. A mobile app guides the operator through the whole acquisition process of inertial data from the hand with RT, and the prediction of tremor patterns is performed on a remote server through machine learning (ML) models. We used two decision tree-based algorithms, XGBoost and Random Forest, which were trained on features extracted from inertial data and achieved a classification accuracy of 92% and 89%, respectively, in differentiating alternating from synchronous tremor segments in the validation set. Finally, the classification response (alternating or synchronous RT pattern) is shown to the operator on the mobile app within a few seconds. This study is the first to demonstrate that different electromyographic tremor patterns have their counterparts in terms of rhythmic movement features, thus making inertial data suitable for predicting the muscular contraction pattern of tremors.},

This new device, named “RT-Ring”, is based on a six-axis inertial measurement unit and a Bluetooth Low-Energy microprocessor, and can be worn on a finger of the tremulous hand. A mobile app guides the operator through the whole acquisition process of inertial data from the hand with RT, and the prediction of tremor patterns is performed on a remote server through machine learning (ML) models. We used two decision tree-based algorithms, XGBoost and Random Forest, which were trained on features extracted from inertial data and achieved a classification accuracy of 92% and 89%, respectively, in differentiating alternating from synchronous tremor segments in the validation set. Finally, the classification response (alternating or synchronous RT pattern) is shown to the operator on the mobile app within a few seconds. This study is the first to demonstrate that different electromyographic tremor patterns have their counterparts in terms of rhythmic movement features, thus making inertial data suitable for predicting the muscular contraction pattern of tremors.},

abstract={Rest tremor (RT) is observed in subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET).
