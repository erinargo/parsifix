abstract={Providing intravenous (IV) fluids to a patient with signs or symptoms of hypoperfusion is common. However, evaluating the IV fluid ‘dose–response’ curve of the heart is elusive. Two patients were studied in the emergency department with a wireless, wearable Doppler ultrasound system. Change in the common carotid arterial and internal jugular Doppler spectrograms were simultaneously obtained as surrogates of left ventricular stroke volume (SV) and central venous pressure (CVP), respectively. Both patients initially had low CVP jugular venous Doppler spectrograms. With preload augmentation, only one patient had arterial Doppler measures indicative of significant SV augmentation (i.e., ‘fluid responsive’). The other patient manifested diminishing arterial response, suggesting depressed SV (i.e., ‘fluid unresponsive’) with evidence of ventricular asynchrony. In this short communication, we describe how a wireless, wearable Doppler ultrasound simultaneously tracks surrogates of cardiac preload and output within a ‘Doppler Starling curve’ framework; implications for IV fluid dosing are discussed.},

abstract={BackgroundBecause of high demand on hospital beds, hospitals seek to reduce patients’ length of stay (LOS) while preserving the quality of care. In addition to usual intermittent vital sign monitoring, continuous monitoring might help to assess the patient’s risk of deterioration, in order to improve the discharge process and reduce LOS. The primary aim of this monocenter randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of continuous monitoring in an acute admission ward (AAW) on the percentage of patients who are discharged safely.MethodsA total of 800 patients admitted to the AAW, for whom it is equivocal whether they can be discharged directly after their AAW stay, will be randomized to either receive usual care without (control group) or with additional continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate, posture, and activity, using a wearable sensor (sensor group). Continuous monitoring data are provided to healthcare professionals and used in the discharge decision. The wearable sensor keeps collecting data for 14 days. After 14 days, all patients fill in a questionnaire to assess healthcare use after discharge and, if applicable, their experience with the wearable sensor. The primary outcome is the difference in the percentage of patients who are safely discharged home directly from the AAW between the control and sensor group. Secondary outcomes include hospital LOS, AAW LOS, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, Rapid Response Team calls, and unplanned readmissions within 30 days. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers for implementing continuous monitoring in the AAW and at home will be investigated.DiscussionClinical effects of continuous monitoring have already been investigated in specific patient populations for multiple purposes, e.g., in reducing the number of ICU admissions. However, to our knowledge, this is the first Randomized Controlled Trial to investigate effects of continuous monitoring in a broad patient population in the AAW.Trial registrationhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05181111.

abstract={Recent advancements in functional near-infrared spectroscopy technology have offered a portable, wireless, wearable solution to measure activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the human neuroscience field. This study is the first to validate the different contributions made by the PFC’s eight subregions in healthy young adults to the reactive recovery responses following treadmill-induced unpredictable slip perturbations and vibrotactile cueing (i.e., precues). Our fall-inducing technology platform equipped with a split-belt treadmill provided unpredictable slip perturbations to healthy young adults while walking at their self-selected walking speed. A portable, wireless, wearable, and multi-channel (48 channels) functional near-infrared spectroscopy system evaluated the activity of PFC’s eight subregions (i.e., right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC); frontopolar prefrontal cortex (FPFC); and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)) as quantified by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations. A motion capture system and two force plates beneath the split-belt treadmill were used to quantify participants’ kinematic and kinetic behavior. All participants completed 6 trials: 2 consecutive trials without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (control trials); 3 trials with vibrotactile cueing (2 trials with the slip perturbation (cueing trial) and 1 trial without the slip perturbation (catch trial); and 1 trial without vibrotactile cueing and with a slip perturbation (post-control trial). The PFC subregions’ activity and kinematic behavior were assessed during the three periods (i.e., standing, walking, and recovery periods). Compared to the walkers’ standing and walking periods, recovery periods showed significantly higher and lower levels of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, respectively, in the right and left DLPFC, VLPFC, and FPFC, regardless of the presence of vibrotactile cueing. However, there was no significant difference in the right and left OFC between the three periods. Kinematic analyses confirmed that vibrotactile cueing significantly improved reactive recovery responses without requiring more involvement by the PFC subregions, which suggests that the sum of attentional resources is similar in cued and non-cued motor responses. The results could inform the design of wearable technologies that alert their users to the risks of falling and assist with the development of new gait perturbation paradigms that prompt reactive responses.},

abstract={ObjectiveAllergic rhinitis (AR) is a common allergic disorder, afflicting thousands of human beings. Aberrant mitochondrial dynamics are important pathological elements for various immune cell dysfunctions and allergic diseases. However, the connection between mitochondrial dynamics and AR remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether mitochondrial dynamics influence the inflammatory response in AR.MethodsIn the present study, we established a murine model of AR by sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA). Then, we investigated the mitochondrial morphology in mice with AR by transmission electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy, and evaluated the role of Mdivi-1 (an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission) on allergic symptoms, inflammatory responses, allergic-related signals, and reactive oxygen species formation.ResultsThere was a notable enhancement in mitochondrial fragmentation in the nasal mucosa of mice following OVA stimulation, whereas Mdivi-1 prevented aberrant mitochondrial morphology. Indeed, Mdivi-1 alleviated the rubbing and sneezing responses in OVA-sensitized mice. Compared with vehicle-treated ones, mice treated with Mdivi-1 exhibited a reduction in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and specific IgE levels in both serum and nasal lavage fluid, and shown an amelioration in inflammatory response of nasal mucosa. Meanwhile, Mdivi-1 treatment was associated with a suppression in JAK2 and STAT6 activation and reactive oxygen species generation, which act as important signaling for allergic response.ConclusionOur findings reveal mitochondrial dynamics modulate the allergic responses in AR. Mitochondrial dynamics may represent a promising target for the treatment of AR.},

abstract={COVID-19 has impacted the healthcare system across the globe. The study will span three pandemic waves in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The goal is to learn how the pandemic affects antenatal care (ANC) and emergency delivery care for pregnant women in Tamil Nadu, India, and how medical services respond. The study employs counterfactual analysis to evaluate the causal impact of the pandemic. A feedforward in combination with a simple auto-regressive neural network (AR-Net) is used to predict the daily number of calls for ambulance services (CAS). Three categories of the daily CAS count between January 2016 and December 2022 are utilised. The total CAS includes all types of medical emergencies; the second group pertains to planned ANC for high-risk pregnant women and the third group comprises CAS from pregnant women for medical emergencies. The second wave’s infection and mortality rates were up to six times higher than the first. The phases in wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III experienced a significant increase in both total IFT (inter-facility transfer) and total non-IFT calls covering all emergencies relative to the counterfactual, as evidenced by reported effect sizes of 1 and a range of 0.65 to 0.85, respectively. This highlights overwhelmed health services. In Tamil Nadu, neither emergency prenatal care nor planned prenatal care was affected by the pandemic. In contrast, the increase in actual emergency-related IFT calls during wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III was 62%, 160%, 141%, and 165%, respectively, relative to the counterfactual. During the same time periods, the mean daily CAS related to prenatal care increased by 47%, 51%, 38%, and 38%, respectively, compared to pre-pandemic levels. The expansion of ambulance services and increased awareness of these services during wave II and the ensuing phases of Covid-19 pandemic have enhanced emergency care delivery for all, including obstetric and neonatal cohorts.},

abstract={BackgroundWhile the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared smartwatch software for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF), there is lack of guidance on management by physicians. We sought to evaluate the approach to management of Apple Watch alerts for AF by physicians and assess whether respondent and case characteristics were associated with their approach.MethodsWe conducted a case-based survey of physicians practicing primary care, emergency medicine, and cardiology at 2 large academic centers (Yale and University of California San Francisco) between September and December 2021. Cases described asymptomatic patients receiving Apple Watch AF alerts; cases varied in sex, race, medical history, and notification frequency. We evaluated physician responses among prespecified diagnostic testing, referral, and treatment options.ResultsWe emailed 636 physicians, of whom 95 (14.9%) completed the survey, including 39 primary care, 25 emergency medicine, and 31 cardiology physicians. Among a total of 192 cases (16 unique scenarios), physicians selected at least one diagnostic test in 191 (99.5%) cases and medications in 48 (25.0%). Physicians in primary care, emergency medicine, and cardiology reported varying preference for patient referral (14%, 30%, and 16%, respectively; P=.048), rhythm monitoring (84%, 46%, and 94%, respectively; P<.001), measurement of BNP (8%, 20%, and 2%; P=.003), and use of antiarrhythmics (16%, 4%, and 23%; P=.023). There were few physician differences in reported practices across patient demographics (sex and race), clinical complexity, and alert frequency of the clinical case.ConclusionsIn hypothetical cases of patients presenting without clinical symptoms, physicians opted for further diagnostic testing and often to medical intervention based on Apple Watch irregular rhythm notifications. There was also considerable variation across physician specialties, suggesting a need for uniform clinical practice guidelines. Additional study is required before irregular rhythm notifications should be used in clinical settings.},

abstract={IntroductionPediatric port access can be challenging in the emergency department; however, it must be performed promptly and safely. Port education for nurses traditionally includes procedural practice on adult-size, tabletop manikins, which lacks the situational and emotional aspects inherent in pediatrics. The purpose of this foundational study was to describe the knowledge and self-efficacy gain from a simulation curriculum that promotes effective situational dialogue and sterile port access technique, while incorporating a wearable port trainer to enhance simulation fidelity.MethodsAn educational intervention impact study was conducted using a curriculum integrating a comprehensive didactic session with simulation. A unique element included a novel port trainer worn by a standardized patient, along with a second actor portraying a distressed parent at the bedside. Participants completed precourse and postcourse surveys on the day of simulation and a 3-month follow-up survey. Sessions were video recorded for review and content analysis.ResultsThirty-four pediatric emergency nurses participated in the program and demonstrated an overall increase in knowledge and self-efficacy with port access that was sustained at the 3-month follow-up. Data revealed positive feedback regarding the participants’ simulation experience.DiscussionEffective port access education for nurses requires a comprehensive curriculum integrating procedural aspects and situational techniques to address the components of a true port access experience involving pediatric patients and families. Our curriculum successfully combined skill-based practice with situational management, and promoted nursing self-efficacy and competence with port access in the pediatric population.},

abstract={Introduction/Background Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) and disasters require an organised and effective response from medical first responders (MFRs). As such, novel training methods have emerged to prepare and adequately train MFRs for these challenging situations. Particular focus should be placed on extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR, AR, and MR, respectively), and allows participants to develop high-quality skills in realistic and immersive environments. Given the rapid evolution of high-fidelity simulation technology and its advantages, XR simulation has become a promising tool for emergency medicine. Accordingly, this systematic review aims to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of XR training methods and 2) explore the experience of MFRs undergoing such training. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will encompass four distinct themes: MFRs, disasters/MCIs, education and simulation, and XR. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACs) will be searched along with an in-depth examination of the grey literature and reference lists of relevant articles. MetaQAT will be used as a study quality assessment tool and integrated into Covidence as part of the data extraction form. Given the predicted high heterogeneity between studies, it may not be possible to standardise data for quantitative comparison and meta-analysis. Thus, data will be synthesised in a narrative, semi-quantitative manner. Discussion This review will examine the existing literature on the effectiveness of XR simulation as a tool to train MFRs for MCIs, which could ultimately improve preparedness and response to disasters.

abstract={As mass casualty incidents continue to escalate in the United States, we must improve frontline responder performance to increase the odds of victim survival. In this article, we describe the First Responder Virtual Reality Simulator, a high-fidelity, fully immersive, automated, programmable virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to train frontline responders to treat and triage victims of mass casualty incidents. First responder trainees don a wireless VR head-mounted display linked to a compatible desktop computer. Trainees see and hear autonomous, interactive victims who are programmed to simulate individuals with injuries consistent with an explosion in an underground space. Armed with a virtual medical kit, responders are tasked with triaging and treating the victims on the scene. The VR environment can be made more challenging by increasing the environmental chaos, adding patients, or increasing the acuity of patient injuries. The VR platform tracks and records their performance as they navigate the disaster scene. Output from the system provides feedback to participants on their performance. Eventually, we hope that the First Responder system will serve both as an effective replacement for expensive conventional training methods as well as a safe and efficient platform for research on current triage protocols.},

abstract={BackgroundAlcohol withdrawal syndrome, if untreated, can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We aimed to compare the symptoms-triggered approach and fixed-dose approach of benzodiazepine administration for treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in regard to the health care utilization measured by the total dose of benzodiazepines, length of hospital stays, and 90-day readmissions rate.MethodsA single-center prospective non-randomized controlled trial included all patients diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The group of patients admitted between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020, were treated with the fixed-scheduled approach (n = 150), while all patients admitted between November 1, 2020, to October 31, 2021, were treated with the symptoms-trigger approach (n = 50).ResultsThe fixed-dose approach group showed a significant higher 90-day readmissions rate (HR: 2.61; 95% CI = 1.18, 6.84; p = 0.01). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter duration to the first readmission in the fixed-scheduled approach group (HR: 2.3; 95% CI = 5.6, 1.16; p = 0.02). The symptoms-triggered approach group required a significantly lower dose of diazepam (40 mg vs. 10 mg; p < 0.01) and a higher dose of thiamine (800 mg vs. 600 mg; p < 0.01). Length of hospital stay was significantly increased in the symptoms-triggered approach group (3.9 vs. 2.2 days; p < 0.01).DiscussionThe use of a symptoms-triggered approach to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome was associated with a lower 90-day readmission rate, prolonged period to the first readmission, and reduced total dose of benzodiazepines, but longer length of hospital stays.ConclusionThe symptoms-triggered approach is safe, cost-effective, and associated with reduced alcohol dependence relapse.},

abstract={With a rising emphasis on public safety and quality of life, there is an urgent need to ensure optimal air quality, both indoors and outdoors. Detecting toxic gaseous compounds plays a pivotal role in shaping our sustainable future. This review aims to elucidate the advancements in smart wearable (nano)sensors for monitoring harmful gaseous pollutants, such as ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), hydrocarbons (CxHy), and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Differentiating this review from its predecessors, we shed light on the challenges faced in enhancing sensor performance and offer a deep dive into the evolution of sensing materials, wearable substrates, electrodes, and types of sensors. Noteworthy materials for robust detection systems encompass 2D nanostructures, carbon nanomaterials, conducting polymers, nanohybrids, and metal oxide semiconductors. A dedicated section dissects the significance of circuit integration, miniaturization, real-time sensing, repeatability, reusability, power efficiency, gas-sensitive material deposition, selectivity, sensitivity, stability, and response/recovery time, pinpointing gaps in the current knowledge and offering avenues for further research. To conclude, we provide insights and suggestions for the prospective trajectory of smart wearable nanosensors in addressing the extant challenges.},

abstract={Prosthetic reconstruction can serve as a feasible alternative, delivering both functional and aesthetic benefits to individuals with hand and finger injuries, frequent causes of emergency room visits. Implant-related infections pose significant challenges in arthroplasty and osteosynthesis procedures, contributing to surgical failures. As a potential solution to this challenge, this study developed a new class of silver (Ag)-doped chitosan (CS) coatings via electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on osseointegrated prostheses for infection therapy. These coatings were successfully applied to additively manufactured Ti6Al4V ELI samples. In the initial phase, the feasibility of the composite coating was assessed using the Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) techniques. The optimized structures exhibited impressive water uptake in the range of 300–360%. Codeposition with an antibacterial agent proved effective, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the coating morphology. Biologically, CS coatings demonstrated cytocompatibility when in direct contact with a fibroblast cell line (L929) after 72 h. When exposed to the Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (ATCC 12228), these coatings inhibited bacterial growth and biofilm formation within 24 h. These findings underscore the significant potential of this approach for various applications, including endoprostheses like hip implants, internal medical devices, and transcutaneous prostheses such as osseointegrated limb prosthetics for upper and lower extremities.},

abstract={Since hemorrhage is a leading cause of preventable death in both civilian and military settings, the development of advanced decision support monitoring capabilities is necessary to promote improved clinical outcomes. The emergence of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) has provided a bioengineering technology for inducing progressive reductions in central blood volume shown to be accurate as a model for the study of the early compensatory stages of hemorrhage. In this context, the specific aim of this study was to provide for the first time a systematic technical evaluation to meet a commonly accepted engineering standard based on the FDA-recognized Standard for Assessing Credibility of Modeling through Verification and Validation (V&V) for Medical Devices (ASME standard V&V 40) specifically highlighting LBNP as a valuable resource for the safe study of hemorrhage physiology in humans. As an experimental tool, evidence is presented that LBNP is credible, repeatable, and validated as an analog for the study of human hemorrhage physiology compared to actual blood loss. The LBNP tool can promote the testing and development of advanced monitoring algorithms and evaluating wearable sensors with the goal of improving clinical outcomes during use in emergency medical settings.},

abstract={Illicit drug misuse has become a widespread issue that requires continuous drug monitoring and diagnosis. Wearable electrochemical drug detection devices possess the potential to function as potent screening instruments in the possession of law enforcement personnel, aiding in the fight against drug trafficking and facilitating forensic investigations conducted on site. These wearable sensors are promising alternatives to traditional detection methods. In this study, we present a novel wearable electrochemical glove-based analytical device (eGAD) designed especially for detecting the club drug, methamphetamine. To develop this sensor, we immobilized meth aptamer onto silver nanoparticle (AgNPs)-modified electrodes that were printed onto latex gloves. The characteristics of AgNPs, including their shape, size and purity were analysed using FTIR, SEM and UV vis spectrometry, confirming the successful synthesis. The developed sensor shows a 0.1 µg/mL limit of detection and 0.3 µg/mL limit of quantification with a linear concentration range of about 0.01–5 µg/mL and recovery percentages of approximately 102 and 103%, respectively. To demonstrate its applicability, we tested the developed wearable sensor by spiking various alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink samples. We found that the sensor remains effective for 60 days, making it a practical option with a reasonable shelf-life. The developed sensor offers several advantages, including its affordability, ease of handling and high sensitivity and selectivity. Its portable nature makes it an ideal tool for rapid detection of METH in beverages too.},

abstract={PurposeThe rate of project failure across the globe seems to reinforce poor performance as a norm. However, engagement with construction digitalisation (CD) represents a departure point for improving project performance. Amidst researchers' recent empirical engagement with CD, the knowledge of the relationship model between CD and project delivery (PD) is abysmal. As a result, developing a business case for CD in developing countries has been slow due to the dearth of empirical evidence. This paper aims to investigate the influence of digitalisation on project performance.Design/methodology/approachAnchored on cross-sectional survey research design using a questionnaire survey in which a total of 183 copies of structured questionnaires were randomly distributed to medium- and large-sized construction firms operating in Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital. A total of 126 valid responses were received giving an overall response rate of 68.8%. The responses were analysed using mean item score, principal component analysis and multiple linear regression.FindingsFindings from the regression analysis reveal that digitalisation has varying levels of impact on PP measured using quality, time and cost. The relationship model with time performance is weak (r = 0.526, r2 = 0.277); on cost performance, the significant model is also weak (r = 0.502, r2 = 0.252) and moderate on quality (r = 0.663, r2 = 0.439). CD influences project cost, time and quality performance despite the weak relationship model. The results indicate that the most effective benchmark of CD is quality performance.Originality/valueThis study established the relationship between digitalisation and construction PD within the construction industry context, an area lacking research attention in emerging economies. This study is the first study in emerging economies that established the influence of digitalisation on construction PD statistically.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the topic of joint communication and radar sensing (JCRS) and its applications in the scope of upcoming sixth-generation (6G) technology. While the fifth-generation applications have reached the consumer market in the last few years, JCRS has been identified as one of the key technologies for next generation networks. The role of JCRS will vary, ranging from tasks such as radar coordination, context awareness for communication, enhanced security, increased availability, and improving the resilience and trustworthiness of future networks. In this work, the niche of JCRS technology in the future 6G ecosystem, as well as several potential applications, are discussed with a focus on RF hardware. The use of centimeter (cmWave) and millimeter (mmWave) frequency spectrums in the context of JCRS system implementation have been further elaborated. After presenting the near-term application scenarios, the circuit implementation perspectives are investigated in terms of radio frequency (RF) front-end architectures, antenna implementation, and phased arrays. Different communication and radar antenna options are compared, and the best candidates are identified. The packaging options are also presented. From circuit and system perspectives, link budget and self-interference cancellation (SIC) are highlighted. Furthermore, future directions including the next steps on the path to enabling JCRS technology are presented throughout this article. Prior works focused more on physical layers and network capabilities of JCRS systems, with less focus on hardware possibilities; to fill this gap, this article aims to contribute to this exciting research topic with a holistic review of RF hardware, highlighting the diversity of applications and the available technologies to tackle the near- and long-term needs of consumer applications.},

abstract={Currently, academia is grappling with a significant problem—a lack of engagement. Humankind has gone too far into exploring entertainment options, while the education system has not really kept up. Millennials love playing games, and this addiction can be used to engage and motivate them in the learning process. This study examines the effect of digital game-based learning on student engagement and motivation levels and the gender differences in online learning settings. This study was conducted in two distinct phases. A game-based and traditional online quizzing tools were used to compare levels of engagement and motivation, as well as to assess the additional parameter of gender difference. During the first phase of the study, 276 male and female undergraduate students were recruited from Sophomore Seminar classes, and 101 participated in the survey, of which 83 were male and 18 were female. In the second phase, 126 participants were recruited, of which 107 (63 females and 44 males) participated in the anonymous feedback surveys. The results revealed that digital game-based learning has a more positive impact on student engagement and motivation compared to traditional online activities. The incorporation of a leaderboard as a gaming element in the study was found to positively impact the academic performance of certain students, but it could also demotivate some students. Furthermore, female students generally showed a slightly higher level of enjoyment toward the games compared to male students, but they did not prefer a comparison with other students as much as male students did. The favorable response from students toward digital game-based activities indicates that enhancing instruction with such activities will not only make learning an enjoyable experience for learners but also enhance their engagement.},

abstract={Rest tremor (RT) is observed in subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET). Electromyography (EMG) studies have shown that PD subjects exhibit alternating contractions of antagonistic muscles involved in tremors, while the contraction pattern of antagonistic muscles is synchronous in ET subjects. Therefore, the RT pattern can be used as a potential biomarker for differentiating PD from ET subjects. In this study, we developed a new wearable device and method for differentiating alternating from a synchronous RT pattern using inertial data. The novelty of our approach relies on the fact that the evaluation of synchronous or alternating tremor patterns using inertial sensors has never been described so far, and current approaches to evaluate the tremor patterns are based on surface EMG, which may be difficult to carry out for non-specialized operators. This new device, named “RT-Ring”, is based on a six-axis inertial measurement unit and a Bluetooth Low-Energy microprocessor, and can be worn on a finger of the tremulous hand. A mobile app guides the operator through the whole acquisition process of inertial data from the hand with RT, and the prediction of tremor patterns is performed on a remote server through machine learning (ML) models. We used two decision tree-based algorithms, XGBoost and Random Forest, which were trained on features extracted from inertial data and achieved a classification accuracy of 92% and 89%, respectively, in differentiating alternating from synchronous tremor segments in the validation set. Finally, the classification response (alternating or synchronous RT pattern) is shown to the operator on the mobile app within a few seconds. This study is the first to demonstrate that different electromyographic tremor patterns have their counterparts in terms of rhythmic movement features, thus making inertial data suitable for predicting the muscular contraction pattern of tremors.},

abstract={Flexible electronics have demonstrated various strategies to enhance the sensory ability for tactile perception and wearable physiological monitoring. Fibrous microstructures have attracted much interest because of their excellent mechanical properties and fabricability. Herein, a structurally robust fibrous mat was first fabricated by electrospinning, followed by a sequential process of functionalization utilizing ultrasonication treatment and in situ polymerization growth. Electrospun polyurethane (PU) microfibers were anchored with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to form conductive paths along each fiber by a scalable ultrasonic cavitation treatment in an MWCNT suspension. After, a layer of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was grown on the surface of PU fibers decorated with MWCNTs to enhance the conductive conjunctions of MWCNTs. Due to the superior electromechanical behaviors and mechanical reinforcement of PEDOT, the PEDOT/MWCNT@PU mat-based device exhibits a wide working range (0–70 kPa), high sensitivity (1.6 kPa−1), and good mechanical robustness (over 18,000 cycles). The PEDOT/MWCNT@PU mat-based sensor also demonstrates a good linear response to different temperature variations because of the thermoelectricity of the PEDOT/MWCNT composite. This novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional fibrous mats provides a promising opportunity for future applications for high-performance wearable devices.},

abstract={BackgroundFamily physicians had to deliver care remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their efforts highlighted the importance of developing a primary care telemedicine (TM) model. TM has the potential to provide a high-quality option for primary care delivery. However, it poses unique challenges for older adults. Our aim was therefore to explore the effects of TM and the determinants of its use in primary care for older adults.MethodsIn this systematic mixed studies review, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINHAL, AgeLine, DARE, Cochrane Library, and clinical trials research registers were searched for articles in English, French or Russian. Two reviewers performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of study quality. TM’s effects were reported through the tabulation of key variables. TM use determinants were interpreted using thematic analysis based on Chang’s framework. All data were integrated using a joint display matrix.ResultsFrom 3,328 references identified, 20 studies were included. They used either phone (n = 8), videoconference (n = 9) or both (n = 3). Among studies reporting positive outcomes in TM experience, ‘user habit or preferences’ was the most cited barrier and ‘location and travel time’ was the most cited facilitator. Only one study reported negative outcomes in TM experience and reported ‘comfort with patient communication’ and ‘user interface, intended use or usability’ as barriers, and ‘technology skills and knowledge’ and ‘location and travel time’ as facilitators.Among studies reporting positive outcomes in service use and usability, no barrier or facilitator was cited more than once. Only one study reported a positive outcome in health-related and behavioural outcomes.ConclusionsTM in older adults’ primary care generally led to positive experiences, high satisfaction and generated an interest towards alternative healthcare delivery model. Future research should explore its efficacy on clinical, health-related and healthcare services use.},

abstract={Automatic driving technology refers to equipment such as vehicle-mounted sensors and computers that are used to navigate and control vehicles autonomously by acquiring external environmental information. To achieve automatic driving, vehicles must be able to perceive the surrounding environment and recognize and understand traffic signs, traffic signals, pedestrians, and other traffic participants, as well as accurately plan and control their path. Recognition of traffic signs and signals is an essential part of automatic driving technology, and gesture recognition is a crucial aspect of traffic-signal recognition. This article introduces mm-TPG, a traffic-police gesture recognition system based on a millimeter-wave point cloud. The system uses a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave radar as a sensor to achieve high-precision recognition of traffic-police gestures. Initially, a double-threshold filtering algorithm is used to denoise the millimeter-wave raw data, followed by multi-frame synthesis processing of the generated point cloud data and feature extraction using a ResNet18 network. Finally, gated recurrent units are used for classification to enable the recognition of different traffic-police gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that the mm-TPG system has high accuracy and robustness and can effectively recognize traffic-police gestures in complex environments such as varying lighting and weather conditions, providing strong support for traffic safety.},

abstract={BackgroundNeurostimulation is an effective therapy for treating and management of refractory chronic pain. However, the complex nature of pain and infrequent in-clinic visits, determining subject’s long-term response to the therapy remains difficult. Frequent measurement of pain in this population can help with early diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and evaluating long-term therapeutic efficacy. This paper compares the utilization of the common subjective patient-reported outcomes with objective measures captured through a wearable device for predicting the response to neurostimulation therapy.MethodData is from the ongoing international prospective post-market REALITY clinical study, which collects long-term patient-reported outcomes from 557 subjects implanted by Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) or Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) neurostimulators. The REALITY sub-study was designed for collecting additional wearables data on a subset of 20 participants implanted with SCS devices for up to six months post implantation. We first implemented a combination of dimensionality reduction algorithms and correlation analyses to explore the mathematical relationships between objective wearable data and subjective patient-reported outcomes. We then developed machine learning models to predict therapy outcome based on the subject’s response to the numerical rating scale (NRS) or patient global impression of change (PGIC).ResultsPrincipal component analysis showed that psychological aspects of pain were associated with heart rate variability, while movement-related measures were strongly associated with patient-reported outcomes related to physical function and social role participation. Our machine learning models using objective wearable data predicted PGIC and NRS outcomes with high accuracy without subjective data. The prediction accuracy was higher for PGIC compared with the NRS using subjective-only measures primarily driven by the patient satisfaction feature. Similarly, the PGIC questions reflect an overall change since the study onset and could be a better predictor of long-term neurostimulation therapy outcome.ConclusionsThe significance of this study is to introduce a novel use of wearable data collected from a subset of patients to capture multi-dimensional aspects of pain and compare the prediction power with the subjective data from a larger data set. The discovery of pain digital biomarkers could result in a better understanding of the patient’s response to therapy and their general well-being.},

The main contribution of this paper is a low-size/power-controlled, compact and complete CLDBS system with two simultaneous acquisition channels, two simultaneous neurostimulation channels and wireless communication. Each channel has a low-noise amplifier (LNA) buffer in differential configuration to eliminate the DC signal component of the input. Energy management is efficiently done by the control and communication unit. The battery supports almost 9 h with both the acquisition and stimulation circuits active. If only the stimulation circuit is used as an Open Loop DBS, the battery can hold sufficient voltage for 24 h of operation. The whole system is low-cost and portable and therefore it could be used as a wearable device.},

abstract={Overcrowding in densely populated urban areas is increasingly becoming an issue for mental health disorders. Yet, only few studies have examined the association between overcrowding in cities and physiological stress responses. Thus, this study employed wearable sensors (a wearable camera, an Empatica E4 wristband and a smartphone-based GPS) to assess the association between overcrowding and human physiological stress response in four types of urban contexts (green space, transit space, commercial space, and blue space). A case study with 26 participants was conducted in Salzburg, Austria. We used Mask R-CNN to detect elements related to overcrowding such as human crowds, sitting facilities, vehicles and bikes from first-person video data collected by wearable cameras, and calculated a change score (CS) to assess human physiological stress response based on galvanic skin response (GSR) and skin temperature from the physiological data collected by the wristband, then this study used statistical and spatial analysis to assess the association between the change score and the above elements. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using sensor-based measurement and quantitative analysis to investigate the relationship between human stress and overcrowding in relation to different urban elements. The findings of this study indicate the importance of considering human crowds, sitting facilities, vehicles and bikes to assess the impact of overcrowding on human stress at street level.},

abstract={Sudden cardiac death is a sudden and highly fatal condition. Implementing high-quality emergency cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) early on is an effective rescue method for this disease. However, the rescue steps of CPR are complicated and difficult to remember, and the quantitative indicators are difficult to control, which leads to a poor quality of CPR emergency actions outside the hospital setting. Therefore, we have developed CPR emergency equipment with a multisensory feedback function, aiming to guide rescuers in performing CPR through visual, auditory, and tactile interaction. This equipment consists of three components: first aid clothing, an audio-visual integrated terminal, and a vital sign detector. These three components are based on a micro-power WiFi-Mesh network, enabling the long-term wireless transmission of the multisensor data. To evaluate the impact of the multisensory feedback CPR emergency equipment on nonprofessionals, we conducted a controlled experiment involving 32 nonmedical subjects. Each subject was assigned to either the experimental group, which used the equipment, or the control group, which did not. The main evaluation criteria were the chest compression (CC) depth, the CC rate, the precise depth of the CC ratio (5–6 cm), and the precise rate of the CC ratio -(100–120 times/min). The results indicated that the average CC depth in the experimental group was 51.5 ± 1.3 mm, which was significantly better than that of the control group (50.2 ± 2.2 mm, p = 0.012). Moreover, the average CC rate in the experimental group (110.1 ± 6.2 times/min) was significantly higher than that of the control group (100.4 ± 6.6 times/min) (p < 0.001). Compared to the control group (66.37%), the experimental group showed a higher proportion of precise CC depth (82.11%), which is closer to the standard CPR rate of 100%. In addition, the CC ratio of the precise rate was 93.75% in the experimental group, which was significantly better than that of 56.52% in the control group (p = 0.024). Following the experiment, the revised System Availability Scale (SUS) was utilized to evaluate the equipment’s usability. The average total SUS score was 78.594, indicating that the equipment’s acceptability range was evaluated as ‘acceptable’, and the overall adjective rating was ‘good’. In conclusion, the multisensory feedback CPR emergency equipment significantly enhances the CC performance (CC depth, CC rate, the precise depth of CC ratio, the precise rate of CC ratio) of nonprofessionals during CPR, and the majority of participants perceive the equipment as being easy to use.},

abstract={IntroductionEmergency department (ED) care must adapt to meet current and future demands. In Australia, ED quality measures (eg, prolonged length of stay, re-presentations or patient experience) are worse for older adults with multiple comorbidities, people who have a disability, those who present with a mental health condition, Indigenous Australians, and those with a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background. Strengthened ED performance relies on understanding the social and systemic barriers and preferences for care of these different cohorts, and identifying viable solutions that may result in sustained improvement by service providers. A collaborative 5-year project (MyED) aims to codesign, with ED users and providers, new or adapted models of care that improve ED performance, improve patient outcomes and improve patient experience for these five cohorts.Methods and analysisExperience-based codesign using mixed methods, set in three hospitals in one health district in Australia. This protocol introduces the staged and incremental approach to the whole project, and details the first research elements: ethnographic observations at the ED care interface, interviews with providers and interviews with two patient cohorts—older adults and adults with a CALD background. We aim to sample a diverse range of participants, carefully tailoring recruitment and support.Ethics and disseminationEthics approval has been obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (2022/PID02749-2022/ETH02447). Prior informed written consent will be obtained from all research participants. Findings from each stage of the project will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication. Project outputs will be disseminated for implementation more widely across New South Wales, Australia.},

abstract={Currently, an urgent need in the field of wearable electronics is the development of flexible sensors that can be attached to the human body to monitor various physiological indicators and movements. In this work, we propose a method for forming an electrically conductive network of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in a matrix of silicone elastomer to make stretchable sensors sensitive to mechanical strain. The electrical conductivity and sensitivity characteristics of the sensor were improved by using laser exposure, through the effect of forming strong carbon nanotube (CNT) networks. The initial electrical resistance of the sensors obtained using laser technology was ~3 kOhm (in the absence of deformation) at a low concentration of nanotubes of 3 wt% in composition. For comparison, in a similar manufacturing process, but without laser exposure, the active material had significantly higher values of electrical resistance, which was ~19 kOhm in this case. The laser-fabricated sensors have a high tensile sensitivity (gauge factor ~10), linearity of >0.97, a low hysteresis of 2.4%, tensile strength of 963 kPa, and a fast strain response of 1 ms. The low Young’s modulus values of ~47 kPa and the high electrical and sensitivity characteristics of the sensors made it possible to fabricate a smart gesture recognition sensor system based on them, with a recognition accuracy of ~94%. Data reading and visualization were performed using the developed electronic unit based on the ATXMEGA8E5-AU microcontroller and software. The obtained results open great prospects for the application of flexible CNT sensors in intelligent wearable devices (IWDs) for medical and industrial applications.},

abstract={Background: This study aims to evaluate the prognostic role of serum PCT in older patients with suspect sepsis or infective diagnosis in the Emergency Department (ED) with a particular focus on the clinical consequences and characteristics due to frailty status. Methods: This is a observational retrospective study conducted in the ED of a teaching hospital. We identified all consecutive patients aged ≥ 80 years admitted to the ED and subsequently hospitalized for clinical suspicion of infection. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 80 years and clinical suspicion of infection; availability of a PCT determination obtained 6, and patients with low or moderate frailty (CFS 1–6). A multivariate analysis was performed to calculate the adjusted odds of raised PCT values for the study endpoints. Results: In total, 1459 adults ≥ 80 years with a clinical suspicion of infection were included in the study cohort. The median age of the sample was 85 years (82–89), with 718 (49.2%) males. The multivariate models revealed that, after adjusting for significant covariates, the PCT values at ED admission were significantly associated with higher odds of infective diagnosis only in the fit/moderately frail group (Odds Ratio 95% CI] 1.04 1.01–1.08], p 0.009) and not in very frail patients (Odds Ratio 95% CI] 1.02 0.99–1.06], p 0.130). Similarly, PCT values were significantly associated with higher odds of in-hospital death in the fit/moderately frail group (Odds Ratio 95% CI] 1.01 1.00–1.02], p 0.047), but not in the very frail ones (Odds Ratio 95% CI] 1.00 0.98–1.02], p 0.948). Conversely, the PCT values were confirmed to be a good independent predictor of bloodstream infection in both the fit/moderately frail group (Odds Ratio 95% CI] 1.06 1.04–1.08], p < 0.001) and the very frail group (Odds Ratio 95% CI] 1.05 1.03–1.07], p < 0.001). Conclusions: The PCT values at ED admission do not predict infective diagnosis, nor are associated with higher odds of in-hospital death. Still, in frail older adults, the PCT values in ED could be a useful predictor of bloodstream infection.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative technology that has revolutionized the field of healthcare. One of the most promising applications of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare is patient health monitoring, which allows healthcare providers to remotely monitor patients' health and provide prompt medical attention when needed. This research work focuses on developing an Internet of Things (IoT)-based patient health monitoring system aimed at providing a solution for patients, particularly the elderly, who face the risk of unexpected death due to the lack of medical attention. The proposed system utilizes a heartbeat sensor and an Infrared IR temperature sensor connected to Arduino UNO and Nodemcu, respectively, to monitor the patient's vital signs. The sensors collect the data, which is then sent to an Internet of Things (IoT) web platform via a Wi-Fi connection. The Internet of Things (IoT) platform displays the real-time data of the patient's health status, including the temperature and heartbeat rate, which can be monitored by doctors and nurses. The system is designed to send alerts to healthcare providers in the event of any medical emergency, ensuring that prompt medical attention can be provided to the patient. The significance of this research work lies in its potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing a more efficient and effective means of patient health monitoring. The system can be used to monitor a large number of patients simultaneously, which is particularly beneficial in hospitals with a large patient load. Moreover, it can reduce the workload of healthcare providers, allowing them to focus on other critical tasks. This innovative system has the potential to improve the overall quality of healthcare services and lead to better health outcomes for the society.},

abstract={Law enforcement agencies continue to grow in the use of spatial analysis to assist in identifying patterns of outcomes. Despite the critical nature of proper resource allocation for mental health incidents, there has been little progress in statistical modeling of the geo-spatial nature of mental health events in Little Rock, Arkansas. In this article, we provide insights into the spatial nature of mental health data from Little Rock, Arkansas between 2015 and 2018, under a supervised spatial modeling framework. We provide evidence of spatial clustering and identify the important features influencing such heterogeneity via a spatially informed hierarchy of generalized linear, tree-based, and spatial regression models, viz. the Poisson regression model, the random forest model, the spatial Durbin error model, and the Manski model. The insights obtained from these different models are presented here along with their relative predictive performances. The inferential tools developed here can be used in a broad variety of spatial modeling contexts and have the potential to aid both law enforcement agencies and the city in properly allocating resources. We were able to identify several built-environment and socio-demographic measures related to mental health calls while noting that the results indicated that there are unmeasured factors that contribute to the number of events.},

abstract={BackgroundAllergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic disease with high prevalence. There are currently many treatments available. However, despite an often good therapeutic response, many patients still report impairment in quality of life (QoL) during the pollen season. A skewed T helper (Th)2 polarization is a well-acknowledged pathologic feature of AR. In animal models, local notch signaling in peripheral tissue seems crucial for Th2 cell differentiation and the development of AR. However, the involvement of Notch signaling in Th2 cell differentiation and the development of AR in humans remains unknown. Hence, the present study investigated the human expression of Notch receptors on CD4+ T-cells in nasal mucosa and blood. Correspondingly Notch ligand expression was assessed on nasal epithelial cells and neutrophils.MethodologyNasal brush and blood samples from 18 patients with pollen-induced AR and 22 healthy controls were collected outside the pollen season. Notch 1–4 and Jagged-1,2 and Delta-like ligand 1,3–4 was analyzed using flow cytometry.ResultsThe fraction of CD4+Notch1+ and CD4+Notch4+ T-cells was higher in AR patients than in healthy control patients. Further, the expression levels of the Notch ligands JAG-1 and DLL-1 were increased in nasal epithelial cells from AR patients compared to healthy control patients. In addition, AR patients displayed higher expression of JAG-1 on neutrophils both in the nasal mucosa and in peripheral blood.ConclusionThe present study is the first to demonstrate increased activity in the Notch1/4 - JAG-1/DLL-1 pathways among allergic individuals. Further propagating the importance of Notch signalling in AR and blocking JAG-1 and DLL-1-induced Notch signalling by nasal epithelial cells and Neutrophils are potential targets to reduce allergic airway inflammation.},

abstract={A foot placement of inertial sensors is commonly used for heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) event detection. However, in clinical practice, such sensor placement may be difficult or even impossible due to the deformity of patients’ feet. The first contribution of this paper is a new algorithm for HS and TO event detection for cases when the sensors are placed on the lateral malleolus. Such sensor placement allows gait analysis in patients with foot deformities. In addition, the placement of the sensor directly on the wide bone surface of the lateral malleolus ensures secure fixation of the sensor during walking. The proposed algorithm is based on deep neural networks, which can be easily adapted (by retraining the neural networks) for analysis of various pathological gait patterns. It is especially important in clinical practice when the number of possible pathological gait patterns is very large. The algorithm proposed in this paper was implemented in a new wearable system for the clinical gait analysis. The second contribution is a validation of this new wearable system. The performance of both proposed algorithm and gait analysis system was evaluated against a reference treadmill system where a capacitance–based pressure platform was used. A total of 117 healthy volunteers participated in the comparison (62 males and 55 females, age 24–55 years, height 162–183 cm). They were asked to perform 2 min walking trials with different speed.

abstract={The management of nutrition, food, and health for disaster relief personnel is one of the crucial aspects for carrying out effective rescue activities during large-scale natural disasters, such as a big earthquake, flooding, and landslide following heavy rainfall or man-made disasters, such as widespread fire in industrial areas. Rescue workers, such as fire fighters and rescue teams who work on the disaster relief operations, have to work long, hard, and irregular hours that require energy (both intake and expenditure), with especially altered eating patterns. Reliable estimates of the energy expenditure (TEE) for such disaster relief operations have not been fully established. Here, we propose to clarify the energy expenditure for each type of large-scale disaster activity conducted by fire fighters. Thirty fire fighters (survey participants in this research) who participated in the simulation training of large-scale disaster activities wore tri-axial accelerometers and heart rate monitors during training; and, post-training, 28 fire fighters submitted complete activity record tables. An estimation formula combining tri-axial accelerometer and heart rate monitor data was used. Additionally, energy expenditure per hour (excluding resting energy expenditure: REE) (per average body weight of participants) was calculated for 10 types of large-scale disaster response activities. We propose utilization of these data as a reference value for examining the TEE of firefighting and rescue operations in future large-scale disasters.},

abstract={In plant and animal breeding, sometimes observations are not independently distributed. There may exist a correlated relationship between the observations. In the presence of highly correlated observations, the classical premise of independence between observations is violated. Plant and animal breeders are particularly interested to study the genetic components for different important traits. In general, for estimating heritability, a random component in the model must adhere to specific assumptions, such as random components, including errors, having a normal distribution, and being identically independently distributed. However, in many real-world situations, all of the assumptions are not fulfilled. In this study, correlated error structures are considered errors that are associated to estimate heritability for the full-sib model. The number of immediately preceding observations in an autoregressive series that are used to predict the value at the current observation is defined as the order of the autoregressive models. First-order and second-order autoregressive models i.e., AR(1) and AR(2) error structures, have been considered. In the case of the full-sib model, theoretical derivation of Expected Mean sum square (EMS) considering AR(1) structure has been obtained. A numerical explanation is provided for the derived EMS considering AR(1) structure. The predicted mean squares error (MSE) is obtained after including the AR(1) error structures in the model, and heritability is estimated using the resulting equations. It is noticed that correlated errors have a major influence on heritability estimation. Different correlation patterns, such as AR(1) and AR(2), can be inferred to change heritability estimates and MSE values. To attain better results, several combinations are offered for various scenarios.},

abstract={In the current manuscript, a novel software application for rapid damage assessment of RC buildings subjected to earthquake excitation is presented based on artificial neural networks. The software integrates the use of a novel deep learning methodology for rapid damage assessment into modern software development platforms, while the developed graphical user interface promotes the ease of use even from non-experts. The aim is to foster actions both in the pre- and post-earthquake phase. The structure of the source code permits the usage of the application either autonomously as a software tool for rapid visual inspections of buildings prior to or after a strong seismic event or as a component of building information modelling systems in the framework of digitizing building data and properties. The methodology implemented for the estimation of the RC buildings’ damage states is based on the theory and algorithms of pattern recognition problems. The effectiveness of the developed software is successfully tested using an extended, numerically generated database of RC buildings subjected to recorded seismic events.},

abstract={BackgroundBarth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth abnormalities and often leads to death in childhood. Recently, elamipretide has been tested as a potential first disease-modifying drug. This study aimed to identify patients with BTHS who may respond to elamipretide, based on continuous physiological measurements acquired through wearable devices.ResultsData from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 12 patients with BTHS were used, including physiological time series data measured using a wearable device (heart rate, respiratory rate, activity, and posture) and functional scores. The latter included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue score, SWAY Balance Mobile Application score (SWAY balance score), BTHS Symptom Assessment (BTHS-SA) Total Fatigue score, muscle strength by handheld dynamometry, 5 times sit-and-stand test (5XSST), and monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin ratio (MLCL:CL). Groups were created through median split of the functional scores into “highest score” and “lowest score”, and “best response to elamipretide” and “worst response to elamipretide”. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) models were implemented to assess whether physiological data could classify patients according to functional status and distinguish non-responders from responders to elamipretide. AHC models clustered patients according to their functional status with accuracies of 60–93%, with the greatest accuracies for 6MWT (93%), PROMIS (87%), and SWAY balance score (80%). Another set of AHC models clustered patients with respect to their response to treatment with elamipretide with perfect accuracy (all 100%).ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that continuously acquired physiological measurements from wearable devices can be used to predict functional status and response to treatment among patients with BTHS.},

abstract={Many patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not receive cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention (first line treatment for OCD), for example, due to patients’ fear of the exposure and reservations of the therapists. Technology-supported exposure (e.g., exposure therapy with response prevention in mixed reality MERP]) for patients with OCD may help to overcome this obstacle. Building upon findings of our pilot study objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, expectations of treatment success, feasibility, and acceptance of MERP as well as to identify possible limitations. In total, 64 outpatients with contamination-related OCD will be recruited and randomized to one of two conditions: MERP (six sessions in six weeks) and self-guided exposure therapy (six exercises in six weeks). Participants will be assessed before (baseline), after the six-week intervention period (post), as well as three months after post assessment (follow-up) regarding symptomatology (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; Y-BOCS), their subjective evaluation of MERP (acceptance) and sense of presence. The planned study is the first to investigate MERP in patients with OCD.},

abstract={The 2022 Winter Olympics were held in the three competition zones of Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, China. The venues of this Winter Olympics were scattered and the terrain was complex. Moreover, the medical resources of Hebei and Beijing were relatively unbalanced. In the medical security of major events, the connection between first aid and in-hospital processes is of the utmost importance to rescue quality. 5th generation mobile network (5G) applications in medical scenarios are on the rise. It would be of great relevance to fully use 5G’s low-latency and high-speed features to share the process information of patients, ambulance personnel, and the destination hospital’s rescue team at emergency scenes and in transportation, improving rescue efficiency. This paper proposes a system scheme of cross-institutional emergency health information sharing based on 5G and augmented reality wearable devices. It also integrates the construction method of monitoring and other sign data sharing, in addition to testing the proposed scheme’s service quality in 5G environments. In the deployment area of the 5G emergency medical rescue information sharing scheme for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, we selected two designated medical support institutions for testing. The test adopted a combination of fixed-point and driving tests to experiment on the service data, voice service, and streaming media indicators. The 5G signal's coverage rate was close to 100%, the standalone connection's success rate was 100%, and the drop rate was 0. The average downlink rate of multiple scenarios was 620mbps, and the average uplink rate of 5G was over 71.8mbps, which is higher than the average 5G level in China. The downlink rate was more than 20 times larger than the 4th generation mobile network (4G) rate. This study’s proposed scheme demonstrates the importance of 5G applications in emergency response and support, in addition to providing a suitable scheme for the integration of 5G networks in the medical scene.},

abstract={Modern buildings are large and complex, and as more time is spent inside them, the risk of indoor disasters such as fires and gas leaks increases. In the event of such a disaster, the success of the rescue operation depends on the ability of the rescue team to navigate and respond to the complex environment. To address this challenge, we designed a mixed reality (MR)-based system simulating indoor disaster rescue. This system uses augmented indoor maps and MR technology to help rescue teams quickly, and effectively respond to unexpected environmental variables and carry out rescue activities. To test the effectiveness of the system, we created a virtual disaster scenario and evaluated the rescue and escape performance within a shortened “golden time” of 2 min, as opposed to 5 min, given the virtual characteristics of the simulation. The results showed that the system is particularly effective at increasing the speed of rescue activities. Additionally, our results indicated the potential for further improvement through additional research. By applying this system for disaster rescue simulations and training, the safety of firefighters and rescuers can be improved by reducing the risk of injury during rescue operations.},

The table of experimental results shows that the cost can be saved by using the sensor, and the data can be captured accurately, which can meet the needs of rehabilitation medicine for motor function evaluation and training guidance. The range of motion of the joint and the manual measurement value are within 5°, which can meet the needs of rehabilitation medicine for motor function evaluation and training guidance. The system delay is less than 0.5 s, which has good real-time performance and can respond quickly to emergencies, ensuring the safety of patients’ out-of-hospital rehabilitation. The training method of motion rehabilitation robot based on sensor is helpful for rehabilitation doctors to carry out statistical data of functional evaluation and is of great significance for rehabilitation doctors to make training plans for patients and carry out rehabilitation training.},

abstract={Background: This article presents the system architecture and validation of the NeuroSuitUp body–machine interface (BMI). The platform consists of wearable robotics jacket and gloves in combination with a serious game application for self-paced neurorehabilitation in spinal cord injury and chronic stroke. Methods: The wearable robotics implement a sensor layer, to approximate kinematic chain segment orientation, and an actuation layer. Sensors consist of commercial magnetic, angular rate and gravity (MARG), surface electromyography (sEMG), and flex sensors, while actuation is achieved through electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and pneumatic actuators. On-board electronics connect to a Robot Operating System environment-based parser/controller and to a Unity-based live avatar representation game. BMI subsystems validation was performed using exercises through a Stereoscopic camera Computer Vision approach for the jacket and through multiple grip activities for the glove. Ten healthy subjects participated in system validation trials, performing three arm and three hand exercises (each 10 motor task trials) and completing user experience questionnaires. Results: Acceptable correlation was observed in 23/30 arm exercises performed with the jacket. No significant differences in glove sensor data during actuation state were observed. No difficulty to use, discomfort, or negative robotics perception were reported. Conclusions: Subsequent design improvements will implement additional absolute orientation sensors, MARG/EMG based biofeedback to the game, improved immersion through Augmented Reality and improvements towards system robustness.},

abstract={This review article summarizes recent achievements in developing portable electrochemical sensing systems for the detection and/or quantification of controlled substances with potential on-site applications at the crime scene or other venues and in wastewater-based epidemiology. Electrochemical sensors employing carbon screen-printed electrodes (SPEs), including a wearable glove-based one, and aptamer-based devices, including a miniaturized aptamer-based graphene field effect transistor platform, are some exciting examples. Quite straightforward electrochemical sensing systems and methods for controlled substances have been developed using commercially available carbon SPEs and commercially available miniaturized potentiostats. They offer simplicity, ready availability, and affordability. With further development, they might become ready for deployment in forensic field investigation, especially when fast and informed decisions are to be made. Slightly modified carbon SPEs or SPE-like devices might be able to offer higher specificity and sensitivity while they can still be used on commercially available miniaturized potentiostats or lab-fabricated portable or even wearable devices. Affinity-based portable devices employing aptamers, antibodies, and molecularly imprinted polymers have been developed for more specific and sensitive detection and quantification. With further development of both hardware and software, the future of electrochemical sensors for controlled substances is bright.},

abstract={(1) Background: The clinical benefits and procedural efficiencies of performing minimally invasive fusion procedures, such as transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), in the ambulatory surgery center (ASC) are becoming increasingly well established. Currently, Medicare does not provide reimbursement for its beneficiaries eligible for TLIF in the ASC due to a lack of evidence regarding procedural safety. However, the initiation of the Hospital Without Walls program allowed for traditional hospital procedures to be relocated to other facilities such as ASCs, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the utility of TLIF in the ASC in Medicare-age patients. (2) Methods: This single-center, retrospective study compared baseline characteristics, intraoperative variables, and 30-day postoperative safety outcomes between 48 Medicare-age patients undergoing TLIF in the ASC and 48 patients having the same procedure as hospital in-patients. All patients had a one-level TLIF using the VariLift®-LX expandable lumbar interbody fusion device. (3) Results: There were similar patient characteristics, procedural efficiency, and occurrence of clinical 30-day safety events between the two study groups. However, there was a marked and statistically significant difference in the median length of stay favoring TLIF patients treated in the ASC (23.9 h vs. 1.6 h, p = 0.001). All ASC-treated patients were discharged on the day of surgery. Postoperative visits to address adverse events were rare in either group. (4) Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that minimally invasive TLIF can be performed safely and efficiently in the ASC in Medicare-age patients. With same-day discharge, fusion procedures performed in the ASC offer a similar safety and more attractive cost–benefit profile for older patients than the same surgery undertaken in the traditional hospital setting. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should strongly consider extending the appropriate reimbursement codes (CPT ® 22630, 22633) for minimally invasive TLIF and PLIF to the ASC Covered Procedure List so that Medicare-age patients can realize the clinical benefits of surgeries performed in this setting.},

abstract={First responders lose their lives in the line of duty each year, and many of these deaths result from strenuous physical exertion and exposure to harmful environmental agents. Continuous health monitoring may detect diseases and alert the first responder when vital signs are reaching critical levels. However, continuous monitoring must be acceptable to first responders. The purpose of this study was to discover first responders’ current use of wearable technology, their perceptions of what health and environmental indicators should be monitored, and who should be permitted to monitor them. The survey was sent to 645 first responders employed by 24 local fire department stations. A total of 115 (17.8%) first responders answered the survey and 112 were used for analysis. Results found first responders perceived a need for health and environmental monitoring. The health and environmental indicators that respondents perceived as most important for monitoring in the field were heart rate (98.2%) and carbon monoxide (100%), respectively. Overall, using and wearing monitoring devices was not age-dependent and health and environmental concerns were important for first responders at any stage of their career. However, current wearable technology does not seem to be a viable solution for first responders due to device expense and durability issues.},

abstract={Background: Virtual care (VC) and remote patient monitoring programs were deployed widely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Deployments were heterogeneous and evolved as the pandemic progressed, complicating subsequent attempts to quantify their impact. The unique arrangement of the US Military Health System (MHS) enabled direct comparison between facilities that did and did not implement a standardized VC program. The VC program enrolled patients symptomatic for COVID-19 or at risk for severe disease. Patients’ vital signs were continuously monitored at home with a wearable device (Current Health). A central team monitored vital signs and conducted daily or twice-daily reviews (the nurse-to-patient ratio was 1:30). Objective: Our goal was to describe the operational model of a VC program for COVID-19, evaluate its financial impact, and detail its clinical outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective difference-in-differences (DiD) evaluation that compared 8 military treatment facilities (MTFs) with and 39 MTFs without a VC program. Tricare Prime beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19 (Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group 177 or International Classification of Diseases–10 codes U07.1/07.2) who were eligible for care within the MHS and aged 21 years and or older between December 2020 and December 2021 were included. Primary outcomes were length of stay and associated cost savings; secondary outcomes were escalation to physical care from home, 30-day readmissions after VC discharge, adherence to the wearable, and alarms per patient-day. Results: A total of 1838 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to an MTF with a VC program of 3988 admitted to the MHS. Of these patients, 237 (13%) were enrolled in the VC program. The DiD analysis indicated that centers with the program had a 12% lower length of stay averaged across all COVID-19 patients, saving US $2047 per patient. The total cost of equipping, establishing, and staffing the VC program was estimated at US $3816 per day. Total net savings were estimated at US $2.3 million in the first year of the program across the MHS. The wearables were activated by 231 patients (97.5%) and were monitored through the Current Health platform for a total of 3474 (median 7.9, range 3.2-16.5) days. Wearable adherence was 85% (IQR 63%-94%). Patients triggered a median of 1.6 (IQR 0.7-5.2) vital sign alarms per patient per day; 203 (85.7%) were monitored at home and then directly discharged from VC; 27 (11.4%) were escalated to a physical hospital bed as part of their initial admission. There were no increases in 30-day readmissions or emergency department visits. Conclusions: Monitored patients were adherent to the wearable device and triggered a manageable number of alarms/day for the monitoring–team-to-patient ratio. Despite only enrolling 13% of COVID-19 patients at centers where it was available, the program offered substantial savings averaged across all patients in those centers without adversely affecting clinical outcomes.},

abstract={Additive manufacturing is catalyzing a new class of volumetrically varying lattice structures in which the dynamic mechanical response can be tailored for a specific application. Simultaneously, a diversity of materials is now available as feedstock including elastomers, which provide high viscoelasticity and increased durability. The combined benefits of complex lattices coupled with elastomers is particularly appealing for anatomy-specific wearable applications such as in athletic or safety equipment. In this study, Siemens’ DARPA TRADES-funded design and geometry-generation software, Mithril, was leveraged to design vertically-graded and uniform lattices, the configurations of which offer varying degrees of stiffness. The designed lattices were fabricated in two elastomers using different additive manufacturing processes: (a) vat photopolymerization (with compliant SIL30 elastomer from Carbon) and (b) thermoplastic material extrusion (with Ultimaker™ TPU filament providing increased stiffness). Both materials provided unique benefits with the SIL30 material offering compliance suitable for lower energy impacts and the Ultimaker™ TPU offering improved protection against higher impact energies. Moreover, a hybrid lattice combination of both materials was evaluated and demonstrated the simultaneous benefits of each, with good performance across a wider range of impact energies. This study explores the design, material, and process space for manufacturing a new class of comfortable, energy-absorbing protective equipment to protect athletes, consumers, soldiers, first responders, and packaged goods.},

abstract={Background: Disposition decision-making in the emergency department (ED) is crucial to patient safety and quality of care. It can inform better care, lower chance of infections, appropriate follow-up care, and reduced healthcare costs. The aim of this study was to examine correlates of ED disposition among adult patients at a teaching and referral hospital based on patients’ demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics. Method: A cross-sectional study conducted at the ED of the King Abdulaziz Medical City hospital in Riyadh. A two-level validated questionnaire was used—a patient questionnaire and healthcare staff/facility survey. The survey employed a systematic random sampling technique to recruit subjects at a pre-specified interval as patients arrived at the registration desk. We analyzed 303 adult patients visiting the ED, who were triaged, consented to participate in the study, completed the survey, and admitted to a hospital bed or discharged home. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to summarize and determine the interdependence and relationships of variables. We used logistic multivariate regression analysis to establish relationships and the odds of admission to a hospital bed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 50.9 (SD = 21.4, Range 18 to 101). A total of 201 (66%) were discharged home while the rest were admitted to a hospital bed. Results of the unadjusted analysis suggest that older patients, males, patients with low level of education, and those with comorbidities and middle-income were more likely to be admitted to the hospital. The results of the multivariate analysis suggest that patients with comorbidities, urgent conditions, prior history of hospitalization, and higher triage levels were more likely to be admitted to a hospital bed. Conclusions: Having proper triage and timely stopgap review measures in the admission process can help new patients to locations that best support their needs and improve the quality and efficiency of the facility. The findings may be a sentinel indicator that informs overuse or inappropriate use of EDs for non-emergency care, which is a concern in the Saudi Arabian publicly funded health system.},

abstract={Currently, visual Augmented Reality (AR) technology is widespread among the public. Similarly, haptic AR technology is also widely practiced in the academic field. However, conventional haptic AR devices are not suitable for interacting with real objects. These devices are often held by the users, and they contact the real object via the devices. Thus, they prevent direct contact between the user and real objects. To solve this problem, we proposed employing Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) technology. EMS technology does not interfere with the interaction between the user and the real object, and the user can wear the device. First, we examined proper stimulus waveforms for EMS, in addition to pulse waveforms. At the same time, we examined the appropriate frequency and pulse width. The waveforms that we used this time were a sawtooth wave, a reverse sawtooth wave, and a sine wave. Second, to clarify the characteristic of the force presented by the EMS, we measured the relationship between the input voltage and the force presented and obtained the point of subjective equality using the constant method. Subsequently, we presented the bump sensation using EMS to the participants and verified its effectiveness by comparing it with the existing methods.},

abstract={Flexible sensors are the essential foundations of pressure sensing, microcomputer sensing systems, and wearable devices. The flexible tactile sensor can sense stimuli by converting external forces into electrical signals. The electrical signals are transmitted to a computer processing system for analysis, realizing real-time health monitoring and human motion detection. According to the working mechanism, tactile sensors are mainly divided into four types—piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric tactile sensors. Conventional silicon-based tactile sensors are often inadequate for flexible electronics due to their limited mechanical flexibility. In comparison, polymeric nanocomposites are flexible and stretchable, which makes them excellent candidates for flexible and wearable tactile sensors. Among the promising polymers, conjugated polymers (CPs), due to their unique chemical structures and electronic properties that contribute to their high electrical and mechanical conductivity, show great potential for flexible sensors and wearable devices. In this paper, we first introduce the parameters of pressure sensors. Then, we describe the operating principles of resistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric sensors, and review the pressure sensors based on conjugated polymer nanocomposites that were reported in recent years. After that, we introduce the performance characteristics of flexible sensors, regarding their applications in healthcare, human motion monitoring, electronic skin, wearable devices, and artificial intelligence. In addition, we summarize and compare the performances of conjugated polymer nanocomposite-based pressure sensors that were reported in recent years. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future directions of conjugated polymer nanocomposite-based sensors.},

abstract={The human body’s temperature is one of the most important vital markers due to its ability to detect various diseases early. Accurate measurement of this parameter has received considerable interest in the healthcare sector. We present a novel study on the optimization of a temperature sensor based on silver interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) and carbon-sensing film. The sensor was developed on a flexible Kapton thin film first by inkjet printing the silver IDEs, followed by screen printing a sensing film made of carbon black. The IDE finger spacing and width of the carbon film were both optimized, which considerably improved the sensor’s sensitivity throughout a wide temperature range that fully covers the temperature of human skin. The optimized sensor demonstrated an acceptable temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of 3.93 × 10−3 °C−1 for temperature sensing between 25 °C and 50 °C. The proposed sensor was tested on the human body to measure the temperature of various body parts, such as the forehead, neck, and palm. The sensor showed a consistent and reproducible temperature reading with a quick response and recovery time, exhibiting adequate capability to sense skin temperatures. This wearable sensor has the potential to be employed in a variety of applications, such as soft robotics, epidermal electronics, and soft human–machine interfaces.},

abstract={This work presents a novel development of the impact-based mechanism for piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters. More precisely, the effect of an impacting mass on a cantilever piezoelectric transducer is studied both in terms of the tip mass value attached to the cantilever and impact position to find an optimal condition for power extraction. At first, the study is carried out by means of parametric analyses at varying tip mass and impact position on a unimorph MEMS cantilever, and a suitable physical interpretation of the associated electromechanical response is given. The effect of multiple impacts is also considered. From the analysis, it emerges that the most effective configuration, in terms of power output, is an impact at the cantilever tip without a tip mass. By changing the value of the tip mass, a sub-optimal impact position along the beam axis can also be identified. Moreover, the effect of a tip mass is deleterious on the power performance, contrary to the well-known case of a resonant energy harvester. A mesoscale prototype with a bimorph transducer is fabricated and tested to validate the computational models. The comparison shows a good agreement between numerical models and the experiments. The proposed approach is promising in the field of consumer electronics, such as wearable devices, in which the impact-based device moves at the frequencies of human movement and is much lower than those of microsystems.},

note={Copyright - ©2023. The Authors; Last updated - 2023-10-02},
abstract={Walking with a shorter stride length (SL) was recently proposed for gait retraining in medial knee osteoarthritis; however it was never assessed in this patient population. This study tested the hypothesis that shortening SL while maintaining walking speed reduces knee adduction (KAM) and flexion (KFM) moments in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis. Walking trials with normal SL and SL reduced by 0.10 m and 0.15 m were recorded for 15 patients (10 men, 55.5 ± 8.7 years old, 24.6 ± 3.0 kg/m2). SL was modified using an augmented reality system displaying target footprints on the floor. Repeated one-way ANOVAs and post-hoc paired t-tests were performed to compare gait measures between normal and reduced SL. The individual effects of SL reduction were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Group analysis indicated significant decreases in KAM impulse with both SL reductions (p  0.05). Individually, 33 % of the patients decreased the peak KAM, whereas 20 % decreased the KAM impulse. Among these patients with a decrease in peak KAM or in KAM impulse, 0 % and 33 % had a simultaneous increase in peak KFM, respectively. In conclusion, this study showed that SL shortening can decrease kinetic measures associated with the progression of medial knee osteoarthritis in some patients, demonstrating the importance of considering SL modifications on an individual basis. While further research is necessary, notably regarding dose-response relationships and long-term effects, these findings are particularly encouraging because SL reductions could be easily integrated into rehabilitation protocols.},

abstract={Heavy precipitation events and fluvial flood can cause serious damage to property and fatality, and thus flood disaster management is essential to lower the risk, to prevent and to mitigate the crisis. Effective and efficient flood disaster management requires on-site information, forecast and appropriate corresponding response strategies and measures. Therefore, a concept of integrated decision support system (DSS) for flood disaster management is proposed and discussed in this paper. The DSS integrates observation, rainfall forecast, fast flood simulation, historical events and crisis scenarios, and response strategies and measures, by means of information and communication technology (ICT) and internet of things (IoT). The DSS can provide relevant information and offer suggestions of action before and during the crisis. The DSS can also be utilised for disaster drill, education, and demonstration with the help of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or Metaverse technology. The aims of this DSS are to improve existing response strategies and emergency services, to enhance the community-based disaster risk management, and to raise public crisis awareness.},

abstract={Although alcohol consumption may produce effects that can be beneficial or harmful, alcohol consumption prevails among communities around the globe. Additionally, alcohol consumption patterns may be associated with several factors among communities and individuals. Numerous technologies and methods are implemented to enhance the detection and tracking of alcohol consumption, such as vehicle-integrated and wearable devices. In this paper, we present a cellular-based Internet of Things (IoT) implementation in a breath analyzer to enable data collection from multiple users via a single device. Cellular technology using hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) was implemented as an IoT gateway. IoT integration enabled the direct retrieval of information from a database relative to the device and direct upload of data from the device onto the database. A manually developed threshold algorithm was implemented to quantify alcohol concentrations within a range from 0 to 200 mcg/100 mL breath alcohol content using electrochemical reactions in a fuel-cell sensor. Two data collections were performed: one was used for the development of the model and was split into two sets for model development and on-machine validation, and another was used as an experimental verification test. An overall accuracy of 98.16% was achieved, and relative standard deviations within the range from 1.41% to 2.69% were achieved, indicating the reliable repeatability of the results. The implication of this paper is that the developed device (an IoT-integrated breath analyzer) may provide practical assistance for healthcare representatives and researchers when conducting studies involving the detection and data collection of alcohol consumption patterns.},

abstract={Recognizing and collecting evidence at a crime scene are essential tasks for gathering information about perpetrators and/or the dynamics of a criminal event. Hence, the success of a crime investigation is strongly based on the ability of forensic investigators to perform these tasks. Recent studies observing and comparing the performance of experts and novices have highlighted the importance of experience and training for search and recovery strategies at crime scenes. Therefore, relevant training programs in evidence-recovery techniques should be attended by novices to improve their skills. However, the knowledge transfer between skills acquired in the classroom and their practical application in the field is a challenging task. In order to relieve this problem, this paper proposes a serious mixed-reality game, which is called TraceGame, aiming to support the training activities of novice forensic investigators by improving their skills related to the search and recovery of evidence at crime scenes. The purpose of the game is to identify the greatest number of useful traces present in a crime scene that is physically reconstructed at the training site as quickly as possible. As shown in an experimental session, TraceGame is a promising tool for supporting the training of novice forensic investigators.},

abstract={The roles of emergency responders are challenging and often physically demanding, so it is essential that their duties are performed safely and effectively. In this article, we address real-time bio-signal sensor monitoring for responders in disaster scenarios. In particular, we propose the integration of a set of health monitoring sensors suitable for detecting stress, anxiety and physical fatigue in an Internet of Cooperative Agents architecture for search and rescue (SAR) missions (SAR-IoCA), which allows remote control and communication between human and robotic agents and the mission control center. With this purpose, we performed proof-of-concept experiments with a bio-signal sensor suite worn by firefighters in two high-fidelity SAR exercises. Moreover, we conducted a survey, distributed to end-users through the Fire Brigade consortium of the Provincial Council of Málaga, in order to analyze the firefighters’ opinion about biological signals monitoring while on duty. As a result of this methodology, we propose a wearable sensor suite design with the aim of providing some easy-to-wear integrated-sensor garments, which are suitable for emergency worker activity. The article offers discussion of user acceptance, performance results and learned lessons.},

abstract={BackgroundAdequate training and preparation of medical first responders (MFRs) are essential for an optimal performance in highly demanding situations like disasters (e.g., mass accidents, natural catastrophes). The training needs to be as effective as possible, because precise and effective behavior of MFRs under stress is central for ensuring patients’ survival and recovery. This systematic review offers an overview of scientifically evaluated training methods used to prepare MFRs for disasters. It identifies different effectiveness indicators and provides an additional analysis of how and to what extent the innovative training technologies virtual (VR) and mixed reality (MR) are included in disaster training research.MethodsThe systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and focused specifically on (quasi-)experimental studies published between January 2010 and September 2021. The literature search was conducted via Web of Science and PubMed and led to the inclusion of 55 articles.ResultsThe search identified several types of training, including traditional (e.g., lectures, real-life scenario training) and technology-based training (e.g., computer-based learning, educational videos). Most trainings consisted of more than one method. The effectiveness of the trainings was mainly assessed through pre-post comparisons of knowledge tests or self-reported measures although some studies also used behavioral performance measures (e.g., triage accuracy). While all methods demonstrated effectiveness, the literature indicates that technology-based methods often lead to similar or greater training outcomes than traditional trainings. Currently, few studies systematically evaluated immersive VR and MR training.ConclusionTo determine the success of a training, proper and scientifically sound evaluation is necessary. Of the effectiveness indicators found, performance assessments in simulated scenarios are closest to the target behavior during real disasters. For valid yet inexpensive evaluations, objectively assessible performance measures, such as accuracy, time, and order of actions could be used. However, performance assessments have not been applied often. Furthermore, we found that technology-based training methods represent a promising approach to train many MFRs repeatedly and efficiently. These technologies offer great potential to supplement or partially replace traditional training. Further research is needed on those methods that have been underrepresented, especially serious gaming, immersive VR, and MR.},

abstract={BackgroundThe importance of insulin resistance is gaining increasing attention as it plays an important role in carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although exercise is the most important intervention for lowering insulin resistance, it is not easy for HCC patients to maintain high compliance and do appropriate exercise. Mobile health (mHealth) with wearable devices can be the solution to carry out an adjusted and supervised exercise that can normalize insulin resistance in patients with HCC. We developed an HCC-specific application equipped with patient-centered exercise. In this paper, we present a randomized controlled trial protocol comparing an intervention group with a control group to determine whether mHealth-based exercise is effective in normalizing insulin sensitivity in HCC patients with insulin resistance after anticancer treatment.MethodsAn assessor unblinded open label randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted for 80 participants with treatment-naïve or recurrent HCC who have received treatment and achieved complete response at the time of screening. They will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two groups: an intervention group (n = 40) and a control group (n = 40). The intervention group will carry out mHealth-based exercise for 6 months from baseline, whereas the control group will receive the usual follow-up care for the first 3 months and mHealth-based exercise for the next 3 months. Both groups will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months from baseline. The primary outcome is the normalized rate of insulin resistance in each group at 3 months. Insulin resistance is estimated by calculating homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The secondary outcomes are body composition, physical fitness level, physical activity, and quality of life at 3 months.DiscussionThis study is the first RCT to investigate the effect of mHealth-based home exercise with a wrist-wearable device on insulin sensitivity, physical fitness, and quality of life for HCC patients with insulin resistance. The result of this RCT will confirm not only safety and functional improvement but also biological effect when exercising using mHealth in HCC patients.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04649671.

abstract={We sought to estimate the impact of temporary financial assistance (TFA) for housing-related expenses from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on costs for a variety of health care services. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Veterans who entered the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program between 10/2015 and 9/2018. We assessed the effect of TFA on health care costs using a multivariable difference-in-difference approach. Outcomes were direct medical costs of health care encounters (i.e., emergency department, outpatient mental health, inpatient mental health, outpatient substance use disorder treatment, and residential behavioral health) in the VA system. Temporary financial assistance was associated with a decrease in ED (–$11, p<.003), outpatient mental health (–$28, p<.001), outpatient substance use disorder treatment (–$25, p<.001), inpatient mental health (–$258, p<.001), and residential behavioral health (–$181, p<.001) costs per quarter for Veterans in the rapid re-housing component of SSVF. These results can inform policy debates regarding proper solutions to housing instability.},

abstract={As an application paradigm of augmented reality in industry, the projected augmented reality (PAR) system is helpful in assembly, improving the ability of human–computer assembly cooperation. Precious research mainly focuses on visualization whereas the problem of how users naturally interact with the system has still not been discussed. In this paper, we developed a PAR system supporting multi-modal interaction (MMI), with which users could assemble and interact naturally. First, we tested the performance of MMI (speech, gesture, and finger click) against the baseline condition of single mode interaction. Meanwhile, we also compare the performance difference between gesture and finger click in bare-hand interaction. It is found that finger click shows a higher success rate, faster response time, lower false errors, less instruction memory, and better user experience than the gesture in bare-hand interaction. In specific, when the assembly must be completed but the hands are occupied, MMI can take advantage of user interaction modalities and reduce the interaction burden. The results prove that MMI shows better interactive naturalness and performance, which is more suitable for popularization and application in PAR assembly assistance systems. In conclusion, the developed PAR system can be a valid solution for intelligent manufacturing applications.},

abstract={Wearable devices are widely used in the smart healthcare monitoring system to detect changes in user parameters through applications such as wristwatches, bands, and clothing electronic skin. In addition, multimode devices enable monitoring of vital signs, helping diagnose and prevent diseases. A wearable device detects the user's biological signals such as body temperature, movement, heartbeat, and humidity level, transmits the information to the mobile phone, and sends the information to an emergency center/family/clinician through cloud computing or wireless communication systems. This all‐day monitoring system enables the user's status information to be monitored 24 h a day to ensure appropriate treatment, thereby facilitating highly personalized care due to its human‐centricity. When integrated with higher‐level infrastructure, it is expected to be useful in healthcare scenarios, providing benefits to multiple stakeholders. In addition, it will help protect people exposed to potentially life‐threatening environments such as military personnel, first responders, and deep‐sea and space explorers. In this review, the components for implementing an all‐day monitoring system are described, including the electrode design strategy for realizing a skin attachable e‐skin device. Issues related to flexible storage devices and recent research results are also discussed.},

abstract={Major natural disasters have occurred frequently in the last few years, resulting in increased loss of life and economic damage. Most emergency responders do not have first-hand experience with major natural disasters, and thus, there is an urgent need for pre-disaster training. Due to the scenes unreality of traditional emergency drills, the failure to appeal to the target audience and the novel coronavirus pandemic, people are forced to maintain safe social distancing. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out transregional or transnational emergency drills in many countries under the lockdown. There is an increasing demand for simulation training systems that use virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality visualization technologies to simulate major natural disasters. The simulation training system related to natural disasters provides a new way for popular emergency avoidance science education and emergency rescue personnel to master work responsibilities and improve emergency response capabilities. However, to our knowledge, there is no overview of the simulation training system for major natural disasters. Hence, this paper uncovers the visualization techniques commonly used in simulation training systems, and compares, analyses and summarizes the architecture and functions of the existing simulation training systems for different emergency phases of common natural disasters. In addition, the limitations of the existing simulation training system in practical applications and future development directions are discussed to provide reference for relevant researchers to better understand the modern simulation training system.},

abstract={Recently, wearable electronic devices and human–computer interaction are developing prosperously, which expands the requirement of flexible sensing materials. Graphene and its derivatives with extraordinary advantages are highly attractive precursors. However, it is difficult to assemble graphene into macroscopic cubes with good fatigue resistance performance. Here, we propose an efficient way to manufacture a lamellar-structural rGO aerogel with enhanced stiffness and deflection of lamellae, by using MXene as a rigidity additive. The addition of MXene (Ti3C2Tx) improves the mechanical and fatigue resistance properties of the aerogel, making it super compressible and elastic. The highly stable structure of the aerogel can withstand extremely high compressive strain of 90% and long-term compression at 50% strain for at least 10,000 cycles. The lamellar structure makes a great contribution to achieve good sensing performance including high linear sensitivity, low testing limit, wide testing strain range and quick response. These features make the MXene/rGO aerogel a promising sensing material for flexible wearable devices to monitor the subtle and obvious biosignals of the human body movement.},

abstract={In January 2021, the US Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) published a report detailing outcomes of its efforts to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people experiencing homelessness (PEH) in 2020.1 USICH consists of leaders from 19 federal agencies and was authorized by Congress in 1987 to coordinate the federal response to homelessness.2 The council's stated mission in its COVID-19 response, which its report claims to have achieved, was to "save lives and not crash the emergency medical system."1We write as an interdisciplinary team conducting ongoing community-based research in partnership with homelessness service organizations in Indiana. Since April 2020, we have examined the challenges faced by PEH during the COVID-19 pandemic and the organizational-, community-, and system-level responses with respectto risk and impact mitigation.3 Our findings, although specificto Indiana, raise critical questions about the conceptual framings, methodologies, and conclusions presented in the USICH national report.Although the USICH report was published under the previous administration, whose attempts to defund the council and multiple low-income housing programs have been well documented,4 it nonetheless continues to be the latest available federal report on the effects of the pandemic on homeless populations in the United States. Given its authoritative position as a governmental^ sourced communication, we urge new USICH leadership to critically interrogate how these data on PEH were conceptualized, collected, and used5; to be clear about the report's limitations; and to provide a more nuanced and evidence-based update on the status of the council's ongoing efforts.},

Just one day before President Trump left office in January 2021, in fact, the Trump appointees at the US Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH)-the federal coordinating entity made up of leaders from 19 agencies with different roles in responding to homelessness- issued a report1 claiming success in preventing the nation's emergency medical system from "crashing." This triumph supposedly stemmed from keeping homeless populations out ofthat system because they were relatively free of COVID-19. The report further claimed that homeless populations had fared better than expected because of "early and firm action" by those same federal agencies.},

abstract={This study extends the previous research in which it has been shown that a mixed reality (MR) system fosters social interaction behaviours (SIBs) in children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). When comparing this system to a LEGO-based non-digital intervention, it has been observed that an MR system effectively mediates a face-to-face play session between a child with ASC and a child without ASC providing new specific advantageous properties (e.g. not being a passive tool, not needing to be guided by the therapist). Considering the newly collected multimodal data totaling to 72 children (36 trials of dyads, child with ASC/child without ASC), a first goal of the present study is to apply detailed statistical inference and machine learning techniques to extensively evaluate the overall effect of this MR system, when compared to the LEGO condition. This goal also includes the analysis of psychophysiological data and allows the context-driven triangulation of the multimodal data which is operationalized by (i) video-coding of SIBs, (ii) psychophysiological data, and (iii) system logs of user-system events. A second goal is to show how SIBs, taking place in these experiences, are influenced by the internal states of the users and the system. SIBs were measured by video-coding overt behaviours (Initiation, Response and Externalization) and with self-reports. Internal states were measured using a wearable device designed by the FuBIntLab (Full-Body Interaction Lab) to acquire: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) data. Affective sliders and State Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaires were used as self-reports. Repeated-measures design was chosen with two conditions, the MR environment and the traditional therapy LEGO. The results show that the MR system has a positive effect on SIBs when compared to the LEGO condition, with an added advantage of being more flexible.},

abstract={Emergency response (ER) workers perform extremely demanding physical and cognitive tasks that can result in serious injuries and loss of life. Human augmentation technologies have the potential to enhance physical and cognitive work-capacities, thereby dramatically transforming the landscape of ER work, reducing injury risk, improving ER, as well as helping attract and retain skilled ER workers. This opportunity has been significantly hindered by the lack of high-quality training for ER workers that effectively integrates innovative and intelligent augmentation solutions. Hence, new ER learning environments are needed that are adaptive, affordable, accessible, and continually available for reskilling the ER workforce as technological capabilities continue to improve. This article presents the research considerations in the design and integration of use-inspired exoskeletons and augmented reality technologies in ER processes and the identification of unique cognitive and motor learning needs of each of these technologies in context-independent and ER-relevant scenarios. We propose a human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) enabled training framework for these technologies in ER. Finally, how these human-centered training requirements for nascent technologies are integrated in an intelligent tutoring system that delivers across tiered access levels, covering the range of virtual, to mixed, to physical reality environments, is discussed.},

abstract={Rapid advances in wearable electronics and mechno‐sensational human–machine interfaces impose great challenges in developing flexible and deformable tactile sensors with high efficiency, ultra‐sensitivity, environment‐tolerance, and self‐sustainability. Herein, a tactile hydrogel sensor (THS) based on micro‐pyramid‐patterned double‐network (DN) ionic organohydrogels to detect subtle pressure changes by measuring the variations of triboelectric output signal without an external power supply is reported. By the first time of pyramidal‐patterned hydrogel fabrication method and laminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) encapsulation process, the self‐powered THS shows the advantages of remarkable flexibility, good transparency (≈85%), and excellent sensing performance, including extraordinary sensitivity (45.97 mV Pa−1), fast response (≈20 ms), very low limit of detection (50 Pa) as well as good stability (36 000 cycles). Moreover, with the LiBr immersion treatment method, the THS possesses excellent long‐term hyper anti‐freezing and anti‐dehydrating properties, broad environmental tolerance (−20 to 60 °C), and instantaneous peak power density of 20 µW cm−2, providing reliable contact outputs with different materials and detecting very slight human motions. By integrating the signal acquisition/process circuit, the THS with excellent self‐power sensing ability is utilized as a switching button to control electric appliances and robotic hands by simulating human finger gestures, offering its great potentials for wearable and multi‐functional electronic applications.},

abstract={Mobile emergency warning apps are essential for effective emergency communication – of course, provided the population intends to use them. Drawing on protection motivation theory, the study validated a psychometric model to explain what motivates individuals to install a warning app for the first time and to keep using it over time. Multi-group covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to model the answers to a survey that measured the drivers of intention to begin using or intention to continue using a warning app. The model shows that, for both non-users and users, trust, social influence, and response efficacy positively and maladaptive rewards negatively affect intention to use and intention to continue use warning apps. However, perceived vulnerability influences only intention to use, whereas response cost and self-efficacy affect continued use intention. Hence, this study enhances the theoretical understanding of technology-enabled protection behaviors and provides practitioners with a list of factors to consider for pushing the adoption and continued use of emergency warning applications.},

abstract={Background Tele-mentorship is considered to offer a solution to training and providing professional assistance at a distance. Tele-mentoring is a method in which a mentor interactively guides a mentee at a different geographic location in real time using a technological communication device. During a healthcare procedure, tele-mentoring can support a medical expert, remote from the treatment site, to guide a less-experienced practitioner at a different geographic location. Augmented Reality (AR) technology has been incorporated in tele-mentoring systems in healthcare environments globally. However, evidence is absent about the usability of AR technology in tele-mentoring clinical healthcare professionals in managing clinical scenarios. Aim This study aims to evaluate the usability of Augmented Reality (AR) technology in tele-mentorship for managing clinical scenarios. Methods This study uses a quasi-experimental design. Four experienced health professionals and a minimum of twelve novice health practitioners will be recruited for the roles of mentors and mentees, respectively. In the experiment, each mentee wearing the AR headset performs a maximum of four different clinical scenarios in a simulated learning environment. A mentor who stays in a separate room and uses a laptop will provide the mentee remote instruction and guidance following the standard protocols for the treatment proposed for each scenario. The scenarios of Acute Coronary Syndrome, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Pneumonia Severe Reaction to Antibiotics, and Hypoglycaemic Emergency are selected, and the corresponding clinical management protocols developed. Outcome measures include the mentors and mentees’ perception of the AR’s usability, mentorship effectiveness, and the mentees’ self-confidence and skill performance. Ethics The protocol was approved by the Tasmania Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee (Project ID: 23343).

abstract={Until there are sufficient resources to end homelessness in the United States, communities will struggle with how to allocate limited homeless services. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires communities to establish a coordinated assessment system using a standardized tool to prioritize services.1 Until recently, the most widely used tool was the VI-SPDAT (Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool) for single adults or a modification for youths and families.2 The tool assesses individuals' level of vulnerability across their history of housing and homelessness, individual risk factors, socialization and daily functions, and wellness. It then prioritizes people with the highest scores for permanent supportive housing, those with intermediate scores for short-term, rapid-rehousing subsidies, and those with the lowest scores for minimal services. Typically, use of the VI-SPDAT conflates risk assessment with allocation of services, where only the vulnerability score is used to match people to housing and services. The tool has been criticized as invalid and unreliable3 and racially biased,4 but also defended as predicting returns to homelessness.5 There is little justification for the cutoffs between recommended housing options (although, frequently, communities lack sufficient resources to follow these recommendations). Ultimately, widespread concerns led the VI-SPDAT's creators to stop supporting its use.2 This change requires communities to confront both empirical and ethical questions that the availability and near field-wide adoption of a tool, however flawed, allowed them to avoid. To aid communities as they confront these questions, we discuss three issues central to the design of a coordinated assessment processes: risk assessment (what should count as risk?), prioritization (who should get services first?), and matching (who should receive what?). In addition, we draw on bioethical frameworks for allocating scarce medical interventions to inform decisions.},

abstract={Introduction:The goal of disaster triage at both the prehospital and in-hospital level is to maximize resources and optimize patient outcomes. Of the disaster-specific triage methods developed to guide health care providers, the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) algorithm has become the most popular system world-wide. Despite its appeal and global application, the accuracy and effectiveness of the START protocol is not well-known.Objectives:The purpose of this meta-analysis was two-fold: (1) to estimate overall accuracy, under-triage, and over-triage of the START method when used by providers across a variety of backgrounds; and (2) to obtain specific accuracy for each of the four START categories: red, yellow, green, and black.Methods:A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted that searched Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Global Health (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Compendex (Engineering Village), SCOPUS, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Cochrane Library, and PROSPERO. The results were expanded by hand searching of journals, reference lists, and the grey literature. The search was executed in March 2020. The review considered the participants, interventions, context, and outcome (PICO) framework and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Accuracy outcomes are presented as means with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as calculated using the binomial method. Pooled meta-analyses of accuracy outcomes using fixed and random effects models were calculated and the heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic.Results:Thirty-two studies were included in the review, most of which utilized a non-randomized study design (84%). Proportion of victims correctly triaged using START ranged from 0.27 to 0.99 with an overall triage accuracy of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.78). Proportion of over-triage was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.17) while the proportion of under-triage was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.072 to 0.14). There was significant heterogeneity of the studies for all outcomes (P < .0001).Conclusion:This meta-analysis suggests that START is not accurate enough to serve as a reliable disaster triage tool. Although the accuracy of START may be similar to other models of disaster triage, development of a more accurate triage method should be urgently pursued.},

abstract={Background and objectiveContinuous monitoring of breathing activity plays a vital role in the detection of respiratory-based diseases (SA, COPD, etc.). Sleep Apnea (SA) is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep associated with arterial blood desaturation, sympathetic nervous system activation, and cardiovascular impairment. Untreated patients with SA have increased mortality rates compared to the general population. This study aims to design a remote monitoring system for sleep apnea to ensure patient safety and ease the workload of doctors in the Covid-19 era.MethodsThis study aims to design a remote monitoring system for sleep apnea to ensure patient safety and ease the workload of doctors. Our study focuses on a novel portable real-time low-cost sleep apnea monitoring system utilizing the GSM network (GSM Shield Sim900a). Proposed system is a remote monitoring and patient tracking system to detect the apnea event in real time, and to provide information of the sleep position, pulse, and respiratory and oxygen saturation to the medical specialists (SpO2) by establishing a direct contact. As soon as an abnormal condition is detected in the light of these parameters, the condition is reported (instant or in the form of short reports after sleep) to the patient relatives, the doctor’s mobile telephone or to the emergency medical centers (EMCs) through a GSM network to handle the case depending on the patient’s emergency condition.ResultsA study group was formed of six patients for monitoring apnea events (three males and three females) between the ages of 20 and 60. The patients in the study group have sleep apnea (SA) in different grades. All the apnea events were detected, and all the patients were successfully alerted. Also, the patient parameters were successfully sent to all patient relatives. Patients who could not get out of apnea were called through the CALL feature, and they were informed about their ongoing apnea event and told that intervention was necessary. The proposed system is tested on six patients. The beginning moment of apnea was successfully detected and the SMS/CALL feature was successfully activated without delay. During the testing, it has been observed that while some of the patients start breathing after the first SMS, some others needed the second or the third SMS. According to the measurement result, the maximum breathless time is 46 s among the patients, and a SMS is sent every 15 s. In addition, in cases where the patient was breathless for a long time, the CALL feature was actively sought from the relatives of the patient and enabled him to intervene. The proposed monitoring system could be used in both clinical and home settings.ConclusionsThe monitoring of a patient in real time allows to intervene in any unexpected circumstances about the patient. The proposed work uses an acceleration sensor as a reliable method of the sleep apnea for monitoring and prevention. The developed device is more economical, comfortable, and convenient than existing systems not only for the patients but also for the doctors. The patients can easily use this device in their home environment, so which could yield a more comfortable, easy to use, cost-effective, and long-term breathing monitoring system for healthcare applications.},

abstract={The Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) is a technology used in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) that is used efficiently for remote healthcare services. TMIS services can be provided as cloud computing services for storage and processing purposes. TMIS uses wearable sensors to collect patient data and transmit it to the controller node over a public channel. The data is then obtained from the controller node by the medical server and stored in the database for analysis. However, an attacker can attempt to launch attacks on data transferred across an unsecured channel. Several schemes have therefore been proposed to provide mutual authentication however, there are security and performance problems. Therefore, the research aims to design two secure and efficient inter-BAN authentication protocols for WBAN: protocol-I (P-I) for emergency authentication and protocol-II (P-II) for periodic authentication. To analyze the proposed protocols, we conduct an informal security analysis, implement Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic analysis, validate the proposed protocols using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulation tool, and conduct a performance analysis. Consequently, we show that the proposed protocols meet all the security requirements in this research, achieve mutual authentication, prevent passive and active attacks, and have suitable performance for WBAN.},

abstract={In the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, the internet of things (IoT) will play a crucial role in collecting and analyzing information related to human healthcare, public safety, environmental monitoring and home/industrial automation. Even though conventional batteries are widely used to operate IoT devices as a power source, these batteries have a drawback of limited capacity, which impedes broad commercialization of the IoT. In this regard, piezoelectric energy harvesting technology has attracted a great deal of attention because piezoelectric materials can convert electricity from mechanical and vibrational movements in the ambient environment. In particular, piezoelectric-based flexible energy harvesters can precisely harvest tiny mechanical movements of muscles and internal organs from the human body to produce electricity. These inherent properties of flexible piezoelectric harvesters make it possible to eliminate conventional batteries for lifetime extension of implantable and wearable IoTs. This paper describes the progress of piezoelectric perovskite material-based flexible energy harvesters for self-powered IoT devices for biomedical/wearable electronics over the last decade.},

abstract={Wearable sweat sensors offer the possibility of continuous real-time health monitoring of an individual at a low cost without invasion. A variety of sweat glucose sensors have been developed thus far to help diabetes patients frequently monitor blood glucose levels through sweat glucose as a surrogate marker. The present study demonstrates the development and characterization of a three-dimensional paper-based microfluidic electrochemical integrated device (3D PMED) for measuring glucose concentration in sweat in real-time via simple, non-invasive, capillary-action-based sample collection. The device was selective for glucose, and it detected glucose accurately in the clinically relevant range (0~2 mM) in an off-body setup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time NEXAR™ has been used for biosensing applications. Further, the developed glucose sensor has acceptable sensitivity of 16.8 µA/mM/cm2. Importantly, in an on-body setup, the device achieved a significant amperometric response to sweat glucose in a very short amount of time (a few seconds). With detailed investigations, this proof-of-concept study could help further the development of sensitive and selective sweat-based glucose sensing devices for real-time glucose monitoring in diabetes patients.},

abstract={During fire evacuations, crawling is recommended to prevent harm from toxic smoke and to access more breathable air. Few studies have evaluated the physiological burden of crawling, especially for children. The method of using wearable sensors to collect data (e.g., electrodermal activity, EDA; skin temperature, SKT) was used to evaluate the effects of different locomotive postures on children’s velocity and physiological demands. Twenty-eight (28) children (13 boys and 15 girls), aged 4 to 6 years old, traveled up to 22.0 m in different postures: Upright walking (UW), stoop walking (SW), knee and hand crawling (KHC). The results showed that: (1) Gender and age had significant impacts on children’s velocity (p < 0.05): Boys were always faster than girls in any of the three postures and the older the child, the faster the velocity for KHC. (2) Physiological results demonstrated that KHC was more physically demanding than bipedal walking, represented by higher scores of the EDA and SKT indicators, similar to the findings of adults. (3) Gender and age had significant impacts on children’s physiological demands (p < 0.05). The physiological demands were greater for boys than girls. In addition, the higher the age, the less physiological demands he/she needs. Overall, the findings suggest that children are unnecessarily required to choose crawling precisely as adults as the best posture to respond to emergency scenarios. In a severe fire, stoop walking is suggested, as there is more respired air and children could move quickly and avoid overworking physiological burdens. The results of this study are expected to be considered in the evaluation of current evacuation recommendations and for the safety guide of preparedness to improve the effectiveness of risk reduction for children.},

abstract={Objective: To fabricate a lightweight, breathable, comfortable, and able to contour to the curvilinear body shape, electrodes built on a flexible substrate are a significant growth in wearable health monitoring. This research aims to create a GNP/FE electrode-based EEG signal acquisition system that is both efficient and inexpensive. Methodology: Three distinct electrode concentrations were developed for EEG signal acquisition, three distinct electrode concentrations (1.5:1.5, 2:1, and 3:0). The high strength-to-weight ratio to form the tribofilm in the fabrication of the electrode will provide good efficiency. The EEG signal is first subjected to a wavelet transform, which serves as a preliminary analysis. The use of biopotential signals in wearable systems as biofeedback or control commands is expected to substantially impact point-of-care health monitoring systems, rehabilitation devices, human–computer/machine interfaces (HCI/HMI), and brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). The graphene oxide (GO), glycerol (GL), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) GO/GL/PVA plastic electrodes were measured and compared to that of a commercially available electrode using the biopic equipment. The GO/GL/PVA plastic electrode was able to detect EEG signals satisfactorily after being used for two months, demonstrating good conductivity and lower noise than the commercial electrode. The GO/GL/PVA nanocomposite mixture was put into the electrode mold as soon as it was ready and then rapidly chilled. Results: The quality of an acquired EEG signal could be measured in several ways including by its error percentage, correlation coefficient, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The fabricated electrode yield detection ranged from 0.81 kPa−1 % to 34.90 kPa−1%. The performance was estimated up to the response of 54 ms. Linear heating at the rate of 40 °C per minute was implemented on the sample ranges from 0 °C to 240 °C. During the sample electrode testing in EEG signal analysis, it obtained low impedance with a good quality of signal acquisition when compared to a conventional wet type of electrode. Conclusions: A large database was frequently built from all of the simulated signals in MATLAB code. Through the experiment, all of the required data were collected, checked against all other signals, and proven that they were accurate representations of the intended database. Evidence suggests that graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) hematite (FE2O3) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) GNP/FE2O3@PVDF electrodes with a 3:0 concentration yielded the best outcomes.},

abstract={In recent years, vital signals monitoring in sports and health have been considered the research focus in the field of wearable sensing technologies. Typical signals include bioelectrical signals, biophysical signals, and biochemical signals, which have applications in the fields of athletic training, medical diagnosis and prevention, and rehabilitation. In particular, since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in real-time interest in personal health. This has created an urgent need for flexible, wearable, portable, and real-time monitoring sensors to remotely monitor these signals in response to health management. To this end, the paper reviews recent advances in flexible wearable sensors for monitoring vital signals in sports and health. More precisely, emerging wearable devices and systems for health and exercise-related vital signals (e.g., ECG, EEG, EMG, inertia, body movements, heart rate, blood, sweat, and interstitial fluid) are reviewed first. Then, the paper creatively presents multidimensional and multimodal wearable sensors and systems. The paper also summarizes the current challenges and limitations and future directions of wearable sensors for vital typical signal detection. Through the review, the paper finds that these signals can be effectively monitored and used for health management (e.g., disease prediction) thanks to advanced manufacturing, flexible electronics, IoT, and artificial intelligence algorithms; however, wearable sensors and systems with multidimensional and multimodal are more compliant.},

abstract={During the last two decades, managers have been applying Building Information Modeling (BIM) to improve the quality of management as well as operation. The effectiveness of applications within a BIM environment is restrained by the limited immersive experience in virtual environments. Defined as the immersive visualization of virtual scenes, Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technology that can be actively explored to expand BIM to more usage. This paper highlights the need for a structured methodology for the integration of BIM/VR and gives a generic review of BIM and VR in training platforms for management in infrastructures. The rationales for fire evacuation training were formed based on the review. Then, methods of configuring BIM + VR prototypes were formulated for emergency response in highway tunnels. Furthermore, a conceptual framework integrating BIM with VR was proposed to enable the visualization of the physical context in real-time during the training. The result indicated that, extended to the training system of highway management via the “hand” of BIM, the VR solution can benefit more areas, such as the cost of fire evacuation drills in highway tunnels and the tendency of accidents to occur in the emergency response.},

abstract={Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1 st November 2018 and 30 th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8%), travelled 5-10 km (30.6%) and 10-29 minutes (46.9%), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9%). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5%), travelled 90.0%) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0%). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.},

abstract={Intermittent manual measurement of vital signs may not rapidly predict sepsis development in febrile patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). We aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of a wireless monitoring device that continuously measures heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) and a machine learning analysis in febrile but stable patients in the ED. We analysed 468 patients (age, ≥18 years; training set, n = 277; validation set, n = 93; test set, n = 98) having fever (temperature >38 °C) and admitted to the isolation care unit of the ED. The AUROC of the fragmented model with device data was 0.858 (95% confidence interval CI], 0.809–0.908), and that with manual data was 0.841 (95% CI, 0.789–0.893). The AUROC of the accumulated model with device data was 0.861 (95% CI, 0.811–0.910), and that with manual data was 0.853 (95% CI, 0.803–0.903). Fragmented and accumulated models with device data detected clinical deterioration in febrile patients at risk of septic shock 9 h and 5 h 30 min earlier, respectively, than those with manual data. Continuous vital sign monitoring using a wearable device could accurately predict clinical deterioration and reduce the time to recognise potential clinical deterioration in stable ED patients with fever.},

abstract={Skin pH can be used for monitoring infections in a healing wound, the onset of dermatitis, and hydration in sports medicine, but many challenges exist in integrating conventional sensing materials into wearable platforms. We present the development of a flexible, textile-based, screen-printed electrode system for biosensing applications, and demonstrate flexible polyaniline (PANI) composite-based potentiometric sensors on a textile substrate for real-time pH measurement. The pH response of the optimized PANI/dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid/screen-printing ink composite is compared to electropolymerized and drop-cast PANI sensors via open circuit potential measurements. High sensitivity was observed for all sensors between pH 3–10, with a composite based on PANI emeraldine base, demonstrating sufficient response time and a linear sensitivity of −27.9 mV/pH. This exceeded prior flexible screen-printed pH sensors in which all parts of the sensor, including the pH sensing material, are screen-printed. Even better sensitivity was observed for a PANI emeraldine salt composite (−42.6 mV/pH), although the response was less linear. Furthermore, the sensor was integrated into a screen-printed microfluidic channel demonstrating sample isolation during measurement for wearable, micro cloth-based analytical devices. This is the first fully screen-printed flexible PANI composite pH sensor demonstrated on a textile substrate that can additionally be integrated with textile-based microfluidic channels.},

abstract={Telecare medical information system (TMIS) is a technology used in a wireless body area network (WBAN), which has a crucial role in healthcare services. TMIS uses wearable devices with sensors to collect patients’ data and transmit the data to the controller node via a public channel. Then, the medical server obtains the data from the controller node and stores it in the database to be analyzed. Unfortunately, an attacker can try to perform attacks via a public channel. Thus, establishing a secure mutual authentication protocol is essential for secure data transfer. Several authentication schemes have been presented to achieve mutual authentication, but there are performance limitations and security problems. Therefore, this study aimed to propose two secure and efficient WBAN authentication protocols between sensors and a mobile device/controller: authentication protocol-I for emergency medical reports and authentication protocol-II for periodic medical reports. To analyze the proposed authentication protocols, we conducted an informal security analysis, implemented BAN logic analysis, validated our proposed authentication protocol using the AVISPA simulation tool, and conducted a performance analysis. Consequently, we showed that our proposed protocols satisfy all security requirements in this study, attain mutual authentication, resist active and passive attacks, and have suitable computation and communication costs for a WBAN.},

abstract={The impressive development of augmented reality (AR) tools in higher education is instructive. AR applications and activities have not yet been reviewed in their entirety. Lecturers need to take full advantage of AR. The critical questions of this study include whether university lecturers are ready to use AR to drive and complement their teaching and social and cognitive presence with online and hybrid or blended learning, as well as the challenges of AR in teaching and learning. The structure is based on a broad literature review, and the presentation is domesticated. First, COVID-19 and higher education background and associated crisis response and management are discussed. Then the existing challenges of online and blended learning are outlined. AR and associated projections are unpacked, followed by an illumination of AR teaching and activities and challenges. A review of existing literature frames a high fragmentation among various tools, software, and AR apps, leading to increased complexity for adapting the systems to teaching and learning. The discussion illuminates the shortcomings of AR. There is a need for a well-thought-out approach to integrating AR apps into online and blended learning in higher education, addressing stakeholder needs, diversity, and inclusion and expanding a critical discussion on transformative AR teaching and learning. This article outlines the associations between subsets of this body of work on AR activities in teaching and learning in higher education and highlights existing challenges for a multidisciplinary higher education community.},

abstract={Human behavior is stimulated by the outside world, and the emotional response caused by it is a subjective response expressed by the body. Humans generally behave in common ways, such as lying, sitting, standing, walking, and running. In real life of human beings, there are more and more dangerous behaviors in human beings due to negative emotions in family and work. With the transformation of the information age, human beings can use Industry 4.0 smart devices to realize intelligent behavior monitoring, remote operation, and other means to effectively understand and identify human behavior characteristics. According to the literature survey, researchers at this stage analyze the characteristics of human behavior and cannot achieve the classification learning algorithm of single characteristics and composite characteristics in the process of identifying and judging human behavior. For example, the characteristic analysis of changes in the sitting and sitting process cannot be for classification and identification, and the overall detection rate also needs to be improved. In order to solve this situation, this paper develops an improved machine learning method to identify single and compound features. In this paper, the HATP algorithm is first used for sample collection and learning, which is divided into 12 categories by single and composite features; secondly, the CNN convolutional neural network algorithm dimension, recurrent neural network RNN algorithm, long- and short-term extreme value network LSTM algorithm, and gate control is used. The ring unit GRU algorithm uses the existing algorithm to design the model graph and the existing algorithm for the whole process; thirdly, the machine learning algorithm and the main control algorithm using the proposed fusion feature are used for HATP and human beings under the action of wearable sensors. The output features of each stage of behavior are fused; finally, by using SPSS data analysis and re-optimization of the fusion feature algorithm, the detection mechanism achieves an overall target sample recognition rate of about 83.6%. Finally, the research on the algorithm mechanism of machine learning for human behavior feature classification under the new algorithm is realized.},

abstract={To understand the early warning signs of damage during the coal mass deformation process, an integrated monitoring procedure was designed that combines the apparent resistivity (AR) and acoustic emission (AE) of coal damage under multi-step loading. The spatiotemporal response characteristics of AR and the time-varying evolution of AE were studied and the varying correlation between the two was discussed. Additionally, the macro–microscopic mechanics of the AR response during the coal deformation process was explored. The results show that the AR and AE signals corresponded well with the applied load during the coal deformation process. In the early loading stage, variations in AR and AE signals were not apparent. As the applied load increased, the high-resistance area of AR increased and the AE signals became active. The local variation characteristics of AR could be used to indirectly invert the internal structure of the coal samples. The electrical variation in the loaded coal was mainly controlled by the conductive surface of cracks. The acoustic and resistivity methods can strongly complement the spatial and temporal dimensions of early warning systems for disasters. The AE technique can continuously monitor a test area for abnormal occurrences in the engineering site, and AR tomography images that are obtained can be used to locate inversions in the source coal in order to take pre-emptive action before disaster occurs. This research can provide new ideas for monitoring and early warning systems for coal and rock dynamic disasters.},

abstract={Despite the increasing utilization of lean practices and digital technologies (DTs) related to Industry 4.0, the impact of such dual interventions on healthcare services remains unclear. This study aims to assess the effects of those interventions and provide a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics in healthcare settings. The methodology comprised a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines, searching for lean interventions supported by DTs. Previous studies reporting outcomes related to patient health, patient flow, quality of care, and efficiency were included. Results show that most of the improvement interventions relied on lean methodology followed by lean combined with Six Sigma. The main supporting technologies were simulation and automation, while emergency departments and laboratories were the main settings. Most interventions focus on patient flow outcomes, reporting positive effects on outcomes related to access to service and utilization of services, including reductions in turnaround time, length of stay, waiting time, and turnover time. Notably, we found scarce outcomes regarding patient health, staff wellbeing, resource use, and savings. This paper, the first to investigate the dual intervention of DTs with lean or lean–Six Sigma in healthcare, summarizes the technical and organizational challenges associated with similar interventions, encourages further research, and promotes practical applications.},

abstract={Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) represents an adverse consequence of chronic alcohol use that may lead to serious complications. Therefore, AWS requires timely attention based on its early recognition, where easy-to-apply diagnostic tools are desirable. Our aim was to characterize the performance of a short-scale AST (Anxiety, Sweats, Tremors) in patients from public general hospitals. We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients attended at the Emergency Department diagnosed with AWS. Three scales were applied: CIWA-Ar (Clinical Institute Retirement Assessment Scale-Revised), GMAWS (Glasgow Modified Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome) and AST. Cronbach’s alpha and Cohen’s kappa tests were used for reliability and concordance. Factorial analysis and diagnostic performance including ROC curve were carried out. Sixty-eight males with a mean age of 41.2 years old, with high school education and robust alcohol consumption, were included. Mean scores for CIWA-Ar, GMWAS and AST were 17.4 ± 11.2, 3.9 ± 2.3 and 3.8 ± 2.6, respectively, without significant differences. The AST scale showed an acceptable reliability and concordance (0.852 and 0.439; p < 0.0001) compared with CIWA-Ar and GMAWS. AST component analysis evidenced tremor (77.5% variance), sweat (12.1% variance) and anxiety (10.4% variance). Diagnostic performance of the AST scale was similar to the GMAWS scale, evidencing a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 83.3% and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.837 to discriminate severe AWS, according to CIWA-Ar. The performance of the AST scale to evaluate AWS is comparable with the commonly used CIWA-Ar and GMAWS scales. AST further represents an easy-to-apply instrument.},

abstract={Recent advances in techniques to improve indoor localization accuracy for personnel and asset tracking challenges has enabled wide-spread adoption within the retail, manufacturing, and health care industries. Most currently deployed systems use distance estimates from known reference locations to localize a person or asset using geometric lateration techniques. The distances are determined using one of many radio frequency (RF) based ranging techniques. Unfortunately, such techniques are susceptible to interference and multipath propagation caused by obstructions within buildings. Because range inaccuracies from known locations can directly lead to incorrect position estimates, these systems often require careful upfront deployment design to account for site-specific interference sources. However, the upfront system deployment requirements necessary to achieve high positioning accuracy with RF-based ranging systems makes the use of such systems impractical, particularly for structures constructed of challenging materials or dense configurations. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the accuracy and precision of alternative RF-based devices within a range of indoor spaces composed of different materials and sizes. These spaces range from large open areas such as gymnasiums to confined engineering labs of traditional buildings as well as training buildings at the local Fire Department Training Facility. Our goal is to identify the impact of alternative RF-based systems on localization accuracy and precision specifically for first responders that are called upon to traverse structures composed of different materials and configurations. Consequently, in this study we have specifically chosen spaces that are likely to be encountered by firefighters during building fires or emergency medical responses. Moreover, many of these indoor spaces can be considered hostile using RF-based ranging techniques. We built prototype wearable localization edge devices designed for first responders and characterize both ranging and localization accuracy and precision using alternative transceivers including Bluetooth Low Energy, 433 MHz, 915 MHz, and ultra-wide band. Our results show that in hostile environments, using ultra-wide band transceivers for localization consistently outperforms the alternatives in terms of precision and accuracy.},

abstract={(1) Background: Genetic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is clinically diagnosed. The clinical manifestations and lack of curative therapeutic interventions may lead to mental illnesses, mainly from the depression–anxiety spectrum. (2) Methods: We report the case of a 69-year-old patient diagnosed with HHT and associated psychiatric disorders; a comprehensive literature review was performed based on relevant keywords. (3) Results: Curaçao diagnostic criteria based the HHT diagnosis in our patient case at 63 years old around the surgical interventions for a basal cell carcinoma, after multiple episodes of epistaxis beginning in childhood, but with a long symptom-free period between 20 and 45 years of age. The anxiety–depressive disorder associated with nosocomephobia resulted in a delayed diagnosis and low adherence to medical monitoring. A comprehensive literature review revealed the scarcity of publications analyzing the impact of psychiatric disorders linked to this rare condition, frequently associating behavioral disengagement as a coping strategy, psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. (4) Conclusions: As patients with HHT face traumatic experiences from disease-related causes as well as recurring emergency hospital visits, active monitoring for mental illnesses and psychological support should be considered as part of the initial medical approach and throughout the continuum of care.},

abstract={Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is widely used in rehabilitation and athletic training to generate involuntary muscle contractions. However, EMS leads to rapid muscle fatigue, limiting the force a muscle can produce during prolonged use. Currently available methods to monitor localized muscle fatigue and recovery are generally not compatible with EMS. The purpose of this study was to examine whether Doppler ultrasound imaging can assess changes in stimulated muscle twitches that are related to muscle fatigue from electrical stimulation. We stimulated five isometric muscle twitches in the medial and lateral gastrocnemius of 13 healthy subjects before and after a fatiguing EMS protocol. Tissue Doppler imaging of the medial gastrocnemius recorded muscle tissue velocities during each twitch. Features of the average muscle tissue velocity waveforms changed immediately after the fatiguing stimulation protocol (peak velocity: -38%, p = .022; time-to-zero velocity: +8%, p = .050). As the fatigued muscle recovered, the features of the average tissue velocity waveforms showed a return towards their baseline values similar to that of the normalized ankle torque. We also found that features of the average tissue velocity waveform could significantly predict the ankle twitch torque for each participant (R2 = 0.255–0.849, p < .001). Our results provide evidence that Doppler ultrasound imaging can detect changes in muscle tissue during isometric muscle twitch that are related to muscle fatigue, fatigue recovery, and the generated joint torque. Tissue Doppler imaging may be a feasible method to monitor localized muscle fatigue during EMS in a wearable device.},

abstract={With the increasing improvement of people’s living standards, more and more tourists choose to travel independently, which puts forward higher requirements for the existing tourist guide system of scenic spots. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that integrates computer-generated virtual information into real scenes. It provides more interactive modes, allowing visitors to have a stronger sense of immersion in the real world. The interactive navigation system is an analysis and processing system that recommends algorithms for tourists through the back-end server by collecting the user’s registration information data. It provides tourists with reasonable travel itineraries. This can not only allow users to avoid the peak flow of people and save tourists’ time, but also reduce the hidden dangers of scenic spots and improve the turnover rate of passenger flow. This paper aims to study an interactive guide system combined with augmented reality technology to provide tourism services for tourists in tourist attractions based on geographic locations. This paper proposes an improved probabilistic algorithm model to accurately locate tourists. (Probabilistic algorithms are also called randomization algorithms. Probabilistic algorithms allow the random choice of the next computational step during execution. In many cases, when the algorithm is faced with a choice during the execution process, the random choice is time-saving compared to the optimal one. Therefore, the probabilistic algorithm can greatly reduce the complexity of the algorithm.) At the same time, the paper designs an AR scenic spot tour guide system. It tests the performance of the system. The results show that the initial response speed of the improved probability algorithm is 0.69 s, the average response time is 4 s when the number of concurrent users is finally increased to 600, and the growth rate is about 0.006 s. The improved algorithm can obviously enhance the response speed.},

abstract={Diabetes is one of the lifelong diseases that require systematic medical care to avoid life-menacing ramifications. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause severe damage to most internal body organs, probably leading to death. Particularly, nocturnal hypoglycemic that occur usually at night during sleep. Severe cases of these events can lead to seizures, fainting, loss of consciousness, and death. The current medical devices lack to give the warning to reduce the risk of acquiring nocturnal hypoglycemic events because they use only for glucose monitoring during waking times. Consequently, the main goal of this work is to design and implement a new wearable device to detect and monitor tremors, which occur when a user has hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The device can detect a frequency range of 4–12 Hz by using the accelerometer of Arduino Nano 33 BLE. It can send a signal to the phone application (app) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Once the phone receives a signal, the phone application can activate an alarm system to wake up the patient, call three selected contacts number, and universal emergency number. In case of the user is unresponsive, the app can provide the patient’s location, name, and date of birth to the emergency contacts numbers and universal emergency number. Additionally, the device cost is economically feasible and competitive compared to other medical devices.},

abstract={The world faces the continuously increasing issue of a lack of skilled employees, staff migration, and turnover. It is strengthened by unexpected situations such as wars, pandemics, and other civilization crises. Solutions are sought and researched in various branches of industry and academia, including engineering, social sciences, management, and political and computer sciences. From the viewpoint of this paper, this is a side topic of Industry 4.0 and, more specifically, sustainability in working environments, and the issue is related to production employees who perform manual operations. Some of the tasks cannot be carried out under robotization or automation; therefore, novel human-work support tools are expected. This paper presents such highly demanded support tools related to augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI). First, a panoramic literature review is given. Secondly, the authors explain the main objective of the presented contribution. Then the authors’ achievements are described—the R&D focus on such solutions and the introduction of the developed tools that are based on AR and AI. Benefits connected to the AR-AI technology applications are presented in terms of both time savings with the tool usage and job simplification, enabling inexperienced, unskilled, or less skilled employees to perform the work in the selected manual production processes.},

The study used reflexive thematic analysis, by Braun and Clarke, to analyse two data sets of responses from professional Finnish paramedics; open-ended questions from a web-based survey (n=174) and essays written by masters-degree students (n=34).ResultsThe results were categorized into job demands or resources, as defined in Job Demands and Resource model by Demerouti and Bakker. Themes identified as paramedics’ job demands were continuous stress from mentally burdening work (high workload, environmental stress factors and bearing patients’ and relatives’ emotional burden), uncertainty under expectation pressures (sense of inadequacy and a pressure to perform) and organizational lack of support. Themes identified as paramedics’ job resources were pressure management strategies (distancing coping mechanisms, ability to handle clinical demands and ability to affect own work) and professional self-actualization (psychologically safe work community, professional sense of pride and internal drive to professional development).ConclusionFinnish paramedics exhibit both job demands and resources. Performance pressure, uncertainty and emotional burden and also environmental hazards and psychological safety in communities. This indicates a need to address not only physical aspects of the paramedic work but also early stage performance expectations and organizational cultures.Lawn S, Roberts L, Willis E, Couzner L, Mohammadi L, Goble E.

abstract={The wearable power-assisted robot is a typical auxiliary rehabilitation robot. It is an exoskeleton power-assisted device that helps people to expand their lower limb movement capabilities. Its basic principle is to obtain the motion intention information of the human body through the perception system. Control the DC servo motor installed at the hip joint and the knee joint to drive the movement of the link, so as to achieve the purpose of providing assistance to the human body. In order to improve the dynamic response frequency of the wearable robotic perception system, a sensor signal based on time series analysis is proposed. The online prediction algorithm, which can perform single-step or multistep prediction under the premise of ensuring certain accuracy, can multiply the dynamic response frequency of the wearable-assisted robot sensing system to ensure the real-time performance of the whole system. In order to realize the sensor signal prediction algorithm, we design the corresponding software and hardware system to realize the prediction algorithm. The whole sensor signal prediction algorithm implementation system can be divided into two parts: lower computer and upper computer. The lower computer includes amplification circuit, signal conditioning circuit, and acquisition. The signal processing software part of the circuit and the corresponding MCU and the upper computer mainly include the data acquisition and prediction algorithm implementation, and the upper computer adopts the mixed programming technology of Vc++ and MATLAB to complete the software part of the upper computer. Aiming at the control part of the wearable robotic sensing system, the first generation of DC servo motor embedded motion controller is designed. The motion controller adopts the design concept of embedded motion controller, which has small size, is light weight, and has good expandability. And the motion controller can communicate and debug with the host computer through the serial port, which lays a foundation for the design of the entire embedded control system.},

abstract={Background An emergency response to a medical situation is generally considered to be a risk decision-making problem. When an emergency event occurs, it makes sense to take into account more than one decision maker’s opinions and psychological behaviors. The existing research tends to ignore these multidimensional aspects. To fill this literature gap, we propose a multi-attribute model. Methods The model is based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT), considering multiple experts’ psychological factors. By not assuming full rationality, we extend existing models to allow multiple experts’ risk preferences to be incorporated into the decision-making process in the case of an emergency. Then, traditional CPT is extended by allowing for multiple attributes. In addition, rather than using crisp data, interval values are adopted to tackle the usual uncertainties in reality. Results The multi-attribute CPT based model proposed can deal with the selection of potential emergency alternatives. The model incorporates interval values to allow more uncertainty and the comparative studies show that the optimal solution changes under different scenarios. Conclusions Our illustrative example and comparative study show that considering multiple experts and multiple attributes is more reasonable, especially in complicated situations under an emergency. In addition, decision-makers’ risk preferences highly affect the selection outcomes, highlighting their importance in the medical decision-making process. Our proposed model can be applied to similar fields with appropriate modifications.},

abstract={In emergency response and disaster rescue, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) onboard thermal infrared (TIR) sensors are an essential means of acquiring ground information in the nighttime working environment. To enable field personnel to make better decisions based on TIR video streams returned from a UAV, the geographic information enhancement of TIR video streams is required. At present, it is difficult for low-cost UAVs to carry high-precision attitude sensors and thus obtain high-precision camera attitude information to meet the enhanced processing requirements of UAV TIR video streams. To this end, this paper proposes an improved Kalman filter algorithm to improve the geographic registration (geo-registration) accuracy by fusing the positioning and heading data from the dual-antenna real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) with onboard internal measurement unit (IMU) data. This method can yield high-precision position and attitude data in real time based on low-cost UAV hardware, based on which high-precision geo-registration results can be obtained. The computational complexity can be reduced compared with video stream feature tracking algorithms. Furthermore, the problem of unstable matching due to the low resolution and texture level of TIR video streams can be avoided. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can reduce the registration error by 66.15%, and significantly improve the geo-registration accuracy of UAV TIR video streams. Thus, it can strongly support the popularization and practicality of the application of augmented reality (AR) technology to low-cost UAV platforms.},

abstract={The brain is the most complex organ in the human body, and it is also the most complex organ in the whole biological system, making it the most complex organ on the planet. According to the findings of current studies, modern study that properly characterises the EEG data signal provides a clear classification accuracy of human activities which is distinct from previous research. Various brain wave patterns related to common activities such as sleeping, reading, and watching a movie may be found in the Electroencephalography (EEG) data that has been collected. As a consequence of these activities, we accumulate numerous sorts of emotion signals in our brains, including the Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands. These bands will provide different types of emotion signals in our brain as a result of these activities. As a consequence of the nonstationary nature of EEG recordings, time-frequency-domain techniques, on the other hand, are more likely to provide good findings. The ability to identify different neural rhythm scales using time-frequency representation has also been shown to be a legitimate EEG marker; this ability has also been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for investigating small-scale neural brain oscillations. This paper presents the first time that a frequency analysis of EEG dynamics has been undertaken. An augmenting decomposition consisting of the “Versatile Inspiring Wavelet Transform” and the “Adaptive Wavelet Transform” is used in conjunction with the EEG rhythms that were gathered to provide adequate temporal and spectral resolutions. Children’s wearable sensors are being used to collect data from a number of sources, including the Internet. The signal is conveyed over the Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, the suggested approach is assessed on two EEG datasets, one of which was obtained in a noisy (i.e., nonshielded) environment and the other was recorded in a shielded environment. The results illustrate the resilience of the proposed training strategy. Therefore, our method contributes to the identification of specific brain activity in children who are taking part in the research as a result of their participation. On the basis of several parameters such as filtering response, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, the MATLAB simulation software was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.},

abstract={Real-time noninvasive monitoring of crop water information is an important basis for water-saving irrigation and precise management. Nano-electronic technology has the potential to enable smart plant sensors to communicate with electronic devices and promote the automatic and accurate distribution of water, fertilizer, and medicine to improve crop productivity. In this work, we present a new flexible graphene oxide (GO)-based noninvasive crop water sensor with high sensitivity, fast responsibility and good bio-interface compatibility. The humidity monitoring sensitivity of the sensor reached 7945 Ω/% RH, and the response time was 20.3 s. We first present the correlation monitoring of crop physiological characteristics by using flexible wearable sensors and photosynthesis systems, and have studied the response and synergistic effect of net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of maize plants under different light environments. Results show that in situ real-time sensing of plant transpiration was realized, and the internal water transportation within plants could be monitored dynamically. The synergistic effect of net photosynthetic rate and transpiration of maize plants can be jointly tested. This study provides a new technical method to carry out quantitative monitoring of crop water in the entire life cycle and build smart irrigation systems. Moreover, it holds great potential in studying individual plant biology and could provide basic support to carry out precise monitoring of crop physiological information.},

abstract={Ice and snow sports are very popular fashion sports in the world. The development of ice and snow sports in China is affected by factors such as climate and natural environment, industrial development, consumption concept, and ice and snow culture. With the advent of the intelligent era, technology has developed rapidly, and the emergence of smart wearable devices has been widely used. The article is based on the recognition of ice and snow movement status, combined with wearable technology, signal processing technology, wireless communication technology, using acceleration sensors, biosensors, bluetooth modules, smartphones, and back-end servers to build a “wearable health monitoring based on recognition of the status of human ice and snow movement system.” Through the daily wear test, on the basis of real-time recognition of the human body motion state, the system issues alarms for dangerous fall actions and abnormal physiological signals in different motion states and can use energy management strategies to save system energy according to the user status, which proves reliability of wearable health monitoring architecture based on human motion state recognition. The paper firstly reviews the related works and literatures of ice and snow sports and smart wearable equipment at home and abroad through literature search and web search and uses questionnaire survey, logic analysis, and interview method to study the development of ice and snow sports. It is feasible to go to the snow and ice. Among them, the proportion of people who think it is expensive is the highest, reaching 65%.},

abstract={Collecting sweat and monitoring its rate is important for determining body condition and further sweat analyses, as this provides vital information about physiologic status and fitness level and could become an alternative to invasive blood tests in the future. Presented here is a one-dollar, disposable, paper-based microfluidic chip for real-time monitoring of sweat rate. The chip, pasted on any part of the skin surface, consists of a skin adhesive layer, sweat-proof layer, sweat-sensing layer, and scale layer with a disk-shape from bottom to top. The sweat-sensing layer has an impressed wax micro-channel containing pre-added chromogenic agent to show displacement by sweat, and the sweat volume can be read directly by scale lines without any electronic elements. The diameter and thickness of the complete chip are 25 mm and 0.3 mm, respectively, permitting good flexibility and compactness with the skin surface. Tests of sweat flow rate monitoring on the left forearm, forehead, and nape of the neck of volunteers doing running exercise were conducted. Average sweat rate on left forearm (1156 g·m−2·h−1) was much lower than that on the forehead (1710 g·m−2·h−1) and greater than that on the nape of the neck (998 g·m−2·h−1), in good agreement with rates measured using existing common commercial sweat collectors. The chip, as a very low-cost and convenient wearable device, has wide application prospects in real-time monitoring of sweat loss by body builders, athletes, firefighters, etc., or for further sweat analyses.},

abstract={Emergency first responders play an important role during search and rescue missions, by helping people and saving lives. Thus, it is important to provide them with technology that will maximize their performance and their safety on the field of action. IFAFRI, the “International Forum to Advanced First Responder Innovation” has pointed out several capability gaps that are found in the existing solutions. Based on them, there is a need for the development of novel, modern digital solutions that will better assist responders by helping them on the field and, at the same time, better protect them. The work presented here introduces the logical architecture implemented in the Horizon 2020 project called FASTER (First responders Advanced technologies for Safe and efficienT Emergency Response), which is an innovating digital ecosystem for emergency first response teams. It is a system that meets the requirements of the consortium members but also fills all the gaps that IFARFI has pointed out and consists of mechanisms and tools for data communication, data analysis, monitoring, privacy protection and smart detection mechanisms.},

abstract={The purposes of this paper are to identify risk factors impacting the successful implementation of immersive reality technology (ImT) in the construction industry, analyze these risk factors (impact and probability), assess the relationships among different categories of risk factors, and provide recommendations to improve ImT implementation. A literature review, a pilot test based on expert interviews, and a questionnaire survey were used. First, the risk factors of ImT applications were identified by consulting the relevant literature on virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality; these were subsequently grouped into five categories—technology, operation, individual/worker, investment, and external. Next, a questionnaire survey was designed and distributed to relevant construction practitioners in South Africa (usable response = 175). Twenty-one ImT implementation risk factors were identified, and risk criticality scores ranged from 2.02 to 3.18. High investment cost, the need for extensive worker training, and the possible introduction of new risks for workers were rated as significant risks. The present study confirmed three statistically significant hypothesized risk paths—namely, those between external issues and individual/worker’s concerns, between external issues and investment limitations, and between individual/worker’s concerns and technology concerns. The present study contributes to the literature regarding the adoption of construction technology by providing a list of critical risk factors that could be used to develop models and tools for assessing ImT adoption and guide practitioners involved in integrating ImTs.},

abstract={In the last few years, modern technologies such as numerical simulations, virtual and augmented reality, and agent-based models represented effective tools to study phenomena, which may not be experimentally reproduced due to costs, inherent hazards, or other constraints (e.g., fire or earthquake emergencies and evacuation from buildings). This paper shows how to integrate a virtual reality platform with numerical simulation tools to reproduce an evolutionary fire emergency scenario. It is computed in real time based on the building information model and a fluid dynamic software. A specific software was also used to simulate in real time the crowd dynamic in the virtual environment during the emergency evacuation process. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, the emergency fire evacuation process for an existing school building is presented. The results show that the proposed virtual reality-based system can be employed for reproducing fire emergency scenarios. It can be used to help decision-makers to determine emergency plans and to help firefighters as a training tool to simulate emergency evacuation actions.},

abstract={This paper explores the problem of severe multipath propagation of underwater acoustic signals in a swimming pool. The problem appeared in a study that examined a system used to signal emergency situations (i.e., pre-drowning symptoms detected by a wearable device on a pool user’s wrist) and locate the signal source. A swimming pool acoustic environment is characterized by the presence of large flat reflecting planes surrounding a small volume of water. The reflections are numerous and much stronger than in typical hydroacoustic applications. In this paper, we attempted to create a model of the swimming pool response, one that is suitable for simulation experiments with detection and localization of emergency signals. Then, we explore the possible remedies for the localization system, applied on the transmit side (waveform design) and on the receive side (receiver placement and signal processing). Finally, we present an algorithm for object localization, considering the possible reflections with a multi-hypothesis approach.},

abstract={Search and Rescue (SaR) dogs are important assets in the hands of first responders, as they have the ability to locate the victim even in cases where the vision and or the sound is limited, due to their inherent talents in olfactory and auditory senses. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable’s microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99%) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.},

abstract={This study aimed to describe patients’ demographic characteristics and treatment delivered in private and public dental emergency clinics and to compare them with a pre-pandemic period. A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out on patients attending the University Dental Hospital of the University of Buenos Aires and on one private dental clinic, situated in Buenos Aires, between March and June of 2019 and 2020. The sample considered all the patients’ medical records of those requiring emergency dental treatment at these centers during that period. We systematize the treatments required and delivered by the emergency providers into categories. In 2019, 36,071 patients were treated at the university dental hospital and the private clinic. In 2020, 7485 patients received emergency treatment, showing a fivefold reduction. During a pre-pandemic period, in 2019, both oral care centers provided 44,894 treatments, around three times the treatments provided in 2020 during the same period. We have found significant differences in the age groups of people who required emergency treatment in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period. During the pandemic period, the most represented types of treatment were radiographic exams (3061) and tooth extractions (2583). Conversely, during the pre-pandemic period, the most frequent treatments were radiographic examinations (16,649) and general consultations (10,591). The percentages of all types of treatments differ significantly between the two years except for pediatric consultations and prosthetics emergencies. As the pandemic is still an ongoing sanitary problem, urgent dental care patterns should be considered.},

abstract={This article describes the manufacturing technology of biocompatible flexible strain-sensitive sensor based on Ecoflex silicone and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The sensor demonstrates resistive behavior. Structural, electrical, and mechanical characteristics are compared. It is shown that laser radiation significantly reduces the resistance of the material. Through laser radiation, electrically conductive networks of MWCNT are formed in a silicone matrix. The developed sensor demonstrates highly sensitive characteristics: gauge factor at 100% elongation −4.9, gauge factor at 90° bending −0.9%/deg, stretchability up to 725%, tensile strength 0.7 MPa, modulus of elasticity at 100% 46 kPa, and the temperature coefficient of resistance in the range of 30–40 °C is −2 × 10−3. There is a linear sensor response (with 1 ms response time) with a low hysteresis of ≤3%. An electronic unit for reading and processing sensor signals based on the ATXMEGA8E5-AU microcontroller has been developed. The unit was set to operate the sensor in the range of electrical resistance 5–150 kOhm. The Bluetooth module made it possible to transfer the received data to a personal computer. Currently, in the field of wearable technologies and health monitoring, a vital need is the development of flexible sensors attached to the human body to track various indicators. By integrating the sensor with the joints of the human hand, effective movement sensing has been demonstrated.},

abstract={Objectives. To determine the effect of heat waves on emergency department (ED) visits for individuals experiencing homelessness and explore vulnerability factors.Methods. We used a unique highly detailed data set on sociodemographics of ED visits in San Diego, California, 2012 to 2019. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover design to study the association between various heat wave definitions and ED visits. We compared associations with a similar population not experiencing homelessness using coarsened exact matching.Results. Of the 24688 individuals identified as experiencing homelessness who visited an ED, most were younger than 65 years (94%) and of non-Hispanic ethnicity (84%), and 14% indicated the need for a psychiatric consultation. Results indicated a positive association, with the strongest risk of ED visits during daytime (e.g., 99th percentile, 2 days) heat waves (odds ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval = 1.02,1.64). Patients experiencing homelessness who were younger or elderly and who required a psychiatric consultation were particularly vulnerable to heat waves. Odds of ED visits were higher for individuals experiencing homelessness after matching to nonhomeless individuals based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity.Conclusions. It is important to prioritize individuals experiencing homelessness in heat action plans and consider vulnerability factors to reduce their burden. },

abstract={BackgroundPulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common acute cardiovascular syndrome. Percutaneous catheter directed hydro-mechanical defragmentation (HMD) is one of the recommended treatment options for PE in patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy or failed systemic thrombolysis (ST). We aimed to identify the safety and outcomes of catheter directed HMD in patients with high-risk PE. This nonrandomized controlled trial enrolled all patients with confirmed diagnoses of high- and intermediate-high-risk PE from October 2019 till January 2021. Fifty patients were included and divided into two groups by the PE response team according to the presence or absence of a contraindication for ST. Group B (ST) consists of 25 patients and group A (HMD) of 25 patients who cannot receive ST.ResultsThe two groups were comparable regarding baseline clinical characteristics with mean age 51 ± 13 years. In group A, systolic blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation increased after 24 h (p = 0.002) and 48 h (p < 0.001) compared to pre-HMD procedure. Mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and respiratory rate (RR) decreased after 48 h and at 30 days (p < 0.001) compared to pre-HMD procedure. The increase in systolic BP and oxygen saturation were significantly higher in HMD group compared with ST group after 48 h and at 30 days (p < 0.007). The decrease in PASP and RR was significantly higher in HMD group compared to ST group after 48 h and at 30 days (p < 0.001). Mortality rate at 30 days was 20% in HMD group compared to 32% in ST group.ConclusionsCatheter directed HMD for high-risk and intermediate-high-risk PE is safe and effective with acceptable mortalityTrial registration Clinical trial ID: NCT04099186.},

abstract={High-quality rendering of spatial sound fields in real-time is becoming increasingly important with the steadily growing interest in virtual and augmented reality technologies. Typically, a spherical microphone array (SMA) is used to capture a spatial sound field. The captured sound field can be reproduced over headphones in real-time using binaural rendering, virtually placing a single listener in the sound field. Common methods for binaural rendering first spatially encode the sound field by transforming it to the spherical harmonics domain and then decode the sound field binaurally by combining it with head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). However, these rendering methods are computationally demanding, especially for high-order SMAs, and require implementing quite sophisticated real-time signal processing. This paper presents a computationally more efficient method for real-time binaural rendering of SMA signals by linear filtering. The proposed method allows representing any common rendering chain as a set of precomputed finite impulse response filters, which are then applied to the SMA signals in real-time using fast convolution to produce the binaural signals. Results of the technical evaluation show that the presented approach is equivalent to conventional rendering methods while being computationally less demanding and easier to implement using any real-time convolution system. However, the lower computational complexity goes along with lower flexibility. On the one hand, encoding and decoding are no longer decoupled, and on the other hand, sound field transformations in the SH domain can no longer be performed. Consequently, in the proposed method, a filter set must be precomputed and stored for each possible head orientation of the listener, leading to higher memory requirements than the conventional methods. As such, the approach is particularly well suited for efficient real-time binaural rendering of SMA signals in a fixed setup where usually a limited range of head orientations is sufficient, such as live concert streaming or VR teleconferencing.},

abstract={Scene Walk is a video viewing technique suited to first-person video recorded from wearable cameras. It integrates a 2D video player and visualisation of the camera trajectory into a non-photorealistic partial rendering of the 3D environment as reconstructed from image content. Applications include forensic analysis of first-person video archives, for example as recorded by emergency response teams. The Scene Walk method is designed to support the viewer’s construction and application of a cognitive map of the context in which first-person video was captured. We use methods from wayfinding research to assess the effectiveness of this non-photorealistic approach in comparison to actual physical experience of the scene. We find that Scene Walk does allow viewers to create a more accurate and effective cognitive map of first-person video than is achieved using a conventional video browsing interface and that this model is comparable to actually walking through the original environment.},

In this work, a self-powered flexible humidity sensing device based on poly(vinyl alcohol)/Ti3C2Tx (PVA/MXene) nanofibers film and monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) was reported for the first time. The monolayer MoSe2-based PENG was fabricated by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition techniques, which can generate a peak output of 35 mV and a power density of 42 mW m−2. The flexible PENG integrated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate can harvest energy generated by different parts of human body and exhibit great application prospects in wearable devices. The electrospinned PVA/MXene nanofiber-based humidity sensor with flexible PET substrate under the driven of monolayer MoSe2 PENG, shows high response of ∼40, fast response/recovery time of 0.9/6.3 s, low hysteresis of 1.8% and excellent repeatability.

abstract={Background: Pediatric emergencies involving children are rare events, and the experience of emergency physicians and the results of such emergencies are accordingly poor. Anatomical peculiarities and individual adjustments make treatment during pediatric emergency susceptible to error. Critical mistakes especially occur in the calculation of weight-based drug doses. Accordingly, the need for a ubiquitous assistance service that can, for example, automate dose calculation is high. However, few approaches exist due to the complexity of the problem. Objective: Technically, an assistance service is possible, among other approaches, with an app that uses a depth camera that is integrated in smartphones or head-mounted displays to provide a 3D understanding of the environment. The goal of this study was to automate this technology as much as possible to develop and statistically evaluate an assistance service that does not have significantly worse measurement performance than an emergency ruler (the state of the art). Methods: An assistance service was developed that uses machine learning to recognize patients and then automatically determines their size. Based on the size, the weight is automatically derived, and the dosages are calculated and presented to the physician. To evaluate the app, a small within-group design study was conducted with 17 children, who were each measured with the app installed on a smartphone with a built-in depth camera and a state-of-the-art emergency ruler. Results: According to the statistical results (one-sample t test; P=.42; α=.05), there is no significant difference between the measurement performance of the app and an emergency ruler under the test conditions (indoor, daylight). The newly developed measurement method is thus not technically inferior to the established one in terms of accuracy. Conclusions: An assistance service with an integrated augmented reality emergency ruler is technically possible, although some groundwork is still needed. The results of this study clear the way for further research, for example, usability testing.},

abstract={This paper introduces the musical haptic wearables for audiences (MHWAs), a class of wearable devices for musical applications targeting audiences of live music performances. MHWAs are characterized by embedded intelligence, wireless connectivity to local and remote networks, a system to deliver haptic stimuli, and tracking of gestures and/or physiological parameters. They aim to enrich musical experiences by leveraging the sense of touch as well as providing new capabilities for creative participation. The embedded intelligence enables the communication with other external devices, processes input data, and generates music-related haptic stimuli. We validate our vision with two concert-experiments. The first experiment involved a duo of electronic music performers and twenty audience members. Half of the audience used an armband-based prototype of MHWA delivering vibro-tactile feedback in response to performers’ actions on their digital musical instruments, and the other half was used as a control group. In the second experiment, a smart mandolin performer played live for twelve audience members wearing a gilet-based MHWA, which provided vibro-tactile sensations in response to the performed music. Overall, results from both experiments suggest that MHWAs have the potential to enrich the experience of listening to live music in terms of arousal, valence, enjoyment, and engagement. Nevertheless, results showed that the audio-haptic experience was not homogeneous across participants, who could be grouped as those appreciative of the vibrations and those less appreciative of them. The causes for a lack of appreciation of the haptic experience were mainly identified as the sensation of unpleasantness caused by the vibrations in certain parts of the body and the lack of the comprehension of the relation between what was felt and what was heard. Based on the reported results, we offer suggestions for practitioners interested in designing wearables for enriching the musical experience of audiences of live music via the sense of touch. Such suggestions point towards the need of mechanisms of personalization, systems able to minimize the latency between the sound and the vibrations, and a time of adaptation to the vibrations.},

abstract={Background: Telemedicine has been deployed by health care systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to enable health care workers to provide remote care for both outpatients and inpatients. Although it is reasonable to suspect telemedicine visits limit unnecessary personal contact and thus decrease the risk of infection transmission, the impact of the use of such technology on clinician workflows in the emergency department is unknown. Objective: This study aimed to use a real-time locating system (RTLS) to evaluate the impact of a new telemedicine platform, which permitted clinicians located outside patient rooms to interact with patients who were under isolation precautions in the emergency department, on in-person interaction between health care workers and patients. Methods: A pre-post analysis was conducted using a badge-based RTLS platform to collect movement data including entrances and duration of stay within patient rooms of the emergency department for nursing and physician staff. Movement data was captured between March 2, 2020, the date of the first patient screened for COVID-19 in the emergency department, and April 20, 2020. A new telemedicine platform was deployed on March 29, 2020. The number of entrances and duration of in-person interactions per patient encounter, adjusted for patient length of stay, were obtained for pre- and postimplementation phases and compared with t tests to determine statistical significance. Results: There were 15,741 RTLS events linked to 2662 encounters for patients screened for COVID-19. There was no significant change in the number of in-person interactions between the pre- and postimplementation phases for both nurses (5.7 vs 7.0 entrances per patient, P=.07) and physicians (1.3 vs 1.5 entrances per patient, P=.12). Total duration of in-person interactions did not change (56.4 vs 55.2 minutes per patient, P=.74) despite significant increases in telemedicine videoconference frequency (0.6 vs 1.3 videoconferences per patient, P<.001 for change in daily average) and duration (4.3 vs 12.3 minutes per patient, P<.001 for change in daily average). Conclusions: Telemedicine was rapidly adopted with the intent of minimizing pathogen exposure to health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet RTLS movement data did not reveal significant changes for in-person interactions between staff and patients under investigation for COVID-19 infection. Additional research is needed to better understand how telemedicine technology may be better incorporated into emergency departments to improve workflows for frontline health care clinicians.},

This paper describes a between-participant study (104 participants) to determine how well users can locate e-textile interface discrete target touch points on the forearm without visual attention. We examine whether the addition of active touch embroidery and passive touch nubs (metal snaps with vibro-tactile stimulation) helps in locating input touch points accurately. We found that touch points towards the middle of the interface on the forearm were more difficult to touch accurately than at the ends. We also found that the addition of vibro-tactile stimulation aids in the accuracy of touch interactions by over 9% on average, and by almost 17% in the middle of the interface.},

abstract={IntroductionThe challenging environment of prehospital casualty care demands providers to make prompt decisions and to engage in lifesaving interventions, occasionally without them being adequately experienced. Telementoring based on augmented reality (AR) devices has the potential to decrease the decision time and minimise the distance gap between an experienced consultant and the first responder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether telementoring with AR glasses would affect chest thoracotomy performance and self-confidence of inexperienced trainees.MethodsTwo groups of inexperienced medical students performed a chest thoracotomy in an ex vivo pig model. While one group was mentored remotely using HoloLens AR glasses, the second performed the procedure independently. An observer assessed the trainees’ performance. In addition, trainees and mentors evaluated their own performance.ResultsQuality of performance was found to be superior with remote guidance, without significant prolongation of the procedure (492 s vs 496 s, p=0.943). Moreover, sense of self-confidence among participant was substantially improved in the telementoring group in which 100% of the participants believed the procedure was successful compared with 40% in the control group (p=0.035).ConclusionAR devices may have a role in future prehospital telementoring systems, to provide accessible consultation for first responders, and could thus positively affect the provider's confidence in decision-making, enhance procedure performance and ultimately improve patient prognosis. That being said, future studies are required to estimate full potential of this technology and additional adjustments are necessary for maximal optimisation and implementation in the field of prehospital care.},

abstract={Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) are a sub-class of DTN, designed as a specialized ad hoc network suitable for applications such as emergency responses. Unlike traditional networks, in OppNets communication opportunities are intermittent, so an end-to-end path between the source and the destination may never exist. Existing networks have already brought connectivity to a broad range of devices, such as hand held devices, laptops, tablets, PC, etc. The Internet of Things (IoT) will extend the connectivity to devices beyond just mobile phones and laptops, but to buildings, wearable devices, cars, different things and objects. One of the issues for these networks is the selection of the IoT nodes to carry out a task in OppNets. In this work, we implement two Fuzzy-Based Systems: Node Elimination System (NES) and Node Selection System (NSS) for IoT node elimination and selection in OppNets. We use three input parameters for NES: Node’s Distance to Event (NDE), Node’s Battery Level (NBL), Node’s Free Buffer Space (NFBS) and four input parameters for NSS: Node’s Number of Past Encounters (NNPE), Node’s Unique Encounters (NUE), Node Inter Contact Time (NICT), Node Contact Duration (NCD). The output parameter is IoT Node Selection Possibility (NSP). The results show that the proposed systems make a proper elimination and selection decision for IoT nodes in OppNets.},

abstract={Background: Falls are a common problem among older adults that lead to injury, emergency department (ED) visits, and institutionalization. The Apple Watch can detect falls and alert caregivers and clinicians that help is needed; the device could also be used to objectively collect data on gait, fitness, and falls as part of clinical trials. However, little is known about the ease of use of this technology among older adult ED patients, a population at high risk of recurrent falls. Objective: The goal of this study—the Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II—is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch Series 4 paired with the iPhone and our research app Rhode Island FitTest (RIFitTest) among older adult ED patients seeking care for falls. Methods: We will conduct field-testing with older adult ED patients (n=25) who sustained a fall and their caregivers (n=5) to determine whether they can use the Apple Watch, iPhone, and app either (1) continuously or (2) periodically, with or without telephone assistance from the research staff, to assess gait, fitness, and/or falls over time. During the initial encounter, participants will receive training in the Apple Watch, iPhone, and our research app. They will receive an illustrated training manual and a number to call if they have questions about the research protocol or device usage. Participants will complete surveys and cognitive and motor assessments on the app during the study period. At the conclusion of the study, we will solicit participant feedback through semistructured interviews. Qualitative data will be summarized using framework matrix analyses. Sensor and survey response data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Recruitment began in December 2019 and was on pause from April 2020 until September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Study recruitment will continue until 30 participants are enrolled. This study has been approved by the Rhode Island Hospital Institutional Review Board (approval 1400781-16). Conclusions: GAPcare II will provide insights into the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch, iPhone, and the RIFitTest app in the population most likely to benefit from the technology: older adults at high risk of recurrent falls. In the future, wearables could be used as part of fall prevention interventions to prevent injury before it occurs.

abstract={Firefighters need to gain information from both inside and outside of buildings in first response emergency scenarios. For this purpose, drones are beneficial. This paper presents an elicitation study that showed firefighters’ desires to collaborate with autonomous drones. We developed a Human–Drone interaction (HDI) method for indicating a target to a drone using 3D pointing gestures estimated solely from a monocular camera. The participant first points to a window without using any wearable or body-attached device. Through the drone’s front-facing camera, the drone detects the gesture and computes the target window. This work includes a description of the process for choosing the gesture, detecting and localizing objects, and carrying out the transformations between coordinate systems. Our proposed 3D pointing gesture interface improves on 2D interfaces by integrating depth information with SLAM and solving ambiguity with multiple objects aligned on the same plane in a large-scale outdoor environment. Experimental results showed that our 3D pointing gesture interface obtained average F1 scores of 0.85 and 0.73 for precision and recall in simulation and real-world experiments and an F1 score of 0.58 at the maximum distance of 25 m between the drone and building.},

abstract={Understanding the external environment depends heavily on vision, audition, and touch. Like vision and audition, the human sense of touch is complex. Tactile perception is composed of multiple fundamental and physical experiences felt as changes in stiffness, texture, shape, size, temperature, and weight by the skin. While researchers and industries have made continuous efforts to abstract and recreate these haptic experiences, haptic devices are still limited in invoking intricate and rich sensations. Herein, the design, model, and experimental validation of a wearable skin-like interface, able to recreate the roughness, shape, and size of a perceived object is presented; a platform for an interactive “physical” experience. The cogency of immersion through tactile feedback on moldable clay by the user response from the active haptic feedback, is examined. For the experimental test, a soft pneumatic actuator (SPA)-skin interface (90 Hz bandwidth) with a complex actuation pattern is prototyped. The SPA-skin's performance using three sets of simulated textures (<300 μm) and for reconstructing simulated contours (of a rectangle, circle, or trapezoid) in the virtual reality (VR) platform is investigated. The experimental results demonstrated for the first time how artificially created tactile feedback can indeed simulate physical interaction, with 83% average accuracy for contour reconstruction.},

It is obvious that physical memory cannot be obtained by existing screen- and paper-based trainings. This paper presents a novel training framework for first responders that leverages augmented reality and virtual reality technologies. The framework incorporates novel design thinking processes that are implemented for the design of the training experiences. In addition, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of various metrics such as performance, time on task, accuracy and learning rate are developed to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed framework. A special use case of the emergency medical services called the ambulance bus is investigated and it is shown that the proposed training methodology improved the accuracy of the first responders by a factor of 46% and the speed on executing tasks by 29%.},

abstract={The recent advances of Augmented Reality (AR) in healthcare have shown that technology is a significant part of the current healthcare system. In recent days, augmented reality has proposed numerous intelligent applications in the healthcare domain including, wearable access, telemedicine, remote surgery, diagnosis of medical reports, emergency medicine, etc. These developed augmented healthcare applications aim to improve patient care, increase efficiency, and decrease costs. Therefore, to identify the advances of AR-based healthcare applications, this article puts on an effort to perform an analysis of 45 peer-reviewed journal and conference articles from scholarly databases between 2011 and 2020. It also addresses concurrent concerns and their relevant future challenges including, user satisfaction, convenient prototypes, service availability, maintenance cost, etc. Despite the development of several AR healthcare applications, there are some untapped potentials regarding secure data trans-mission, which is an important factor for advancing this cutting-edge technology. Therefore, this paper also analyzes distinct AR security and privacy including, security requirements (i.e., scalability, confidentiality, integrity, resiliency, etc.) and attack terminologies (i.e. sniffing, fabrication, modification, interception, etc.). Based on the security issues, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence-based dynamic solution to build an intelligent security model to minimize data security risks. This intelligent model can identify seen and unseen threats in the threat detection layer and thus can protect data during data transmission. In addition, it prevents external attacks in the threat elimination layer using threat reduction mechanisms.},

The aim of this study is the development of a wearable gas sensor for the detection of NH3 at room temperature based on the organic semiconductor poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), electrochemically deposited iridium oxide particles, and a hydrogel film. The hydrogel composition was finely optimised to obtain self-healing properties, as well as the desired porosity, adhesion to the substrate, and stability in humidity variations. Its chemical structure and morphology were characterised by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively, and were found to play a key role in the transduction process and in the achievement of a reversible and selective response. The sensing properties rely on a potentiometric-like mechanism that significantly differs from most of the state-of-the-art NH3 gas sensors and provides superior robustness to the final device. Thanks to the reliability of the analytical response, the simple two-terminal configuration and the low power consumption, the PEDOT:PSS/IrOx Ps/hydrogel sensor was realised on a flexible plastic foil and successfully tested in a wearable configuration with wireless connectivity to a smartphone. The wearable sensor showed stability to mechanical deformations and good analytical performances, with a sensitivity of 60 ± 8 μA decade−1 in a wide concentration range (17–7899 ppm), which includes the safety limits set by law for NH3 exposure.},

abstract={Disasters, either manmade or natural, call for rapid and timely actions. Due to disaster, all of the communication infrastructures are destroyed, and there is no way for connection between people in disaster and others outside the disaster range. Drone technology is the critical technology for delivering communication services and guiding people and monitoring the unwanted effects of a disaster. The collaboration of advanced technologies can reduce life losses, save people’s lives, and manage the disaster crisis. The network performance of collaboration between the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone edge intelligence can help gather and process data, extend the wireless coverage area, deliver medical emergencies, provide real-time information about the emergency, and gather data from areas that are impossible for humans to reach. In this paper, we focus on the network performance for efficient collaboration of drone edge intelligence and smart wearable devices for disaster management. We focus mainly on network connectivity parameters for improving real-time data sharing between the drone edge intelligence and smart wearable devices. The relevant parameters that are considered in this study include delay, throughput, and the load from drone edge intelligence. It is further shown that network performance can have significant improvement when the abovementioned parameters are correctly optimised, and the improved performance can significantly improve the guiding/coordinating of search and rescue (SAR) teams effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={Public safety agencies have been working on the modernization of their communication networks and the enhancement of their mission-critical capabilities with novel technologies and applications. As part of these efforts, migrating from traditional land mobile radio (LMR) systems toward cellular-enabled, next-generation, mission-critical networks is at the top of these agencies’ agendas. In this paper, we provide an overview of cellular technologies ratified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to enable next-generation public safety networks. On top of using wireless communication technologies, emergency first responders need to be equipped with advanced devices to develop situational awareness. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the Internet of Life-Saving Things (IoLST) and focus on the role of wearable devices—more precisely, cellular-enabled wearables, in creating new solutions for enhanced public safety operations. Finally, we conduct a performance evaluation of wearable-based, mission-critical applications. So far, most of the mission-critical service evaluations target latency performance without taking into account reliability requirements. In our evaluation, we examine the impact of device- and application-related parameters on the latency and the reliability performance. We also identify major future considerations for better support of the studied requirements in next-generation public safety networks.},

abstract={Forest firefighting missions encompass multiple tasks related to prevention, surveillance, and extinguishing. This work presents a complete survey of firefighters on the current problems in their work and the potential technological solutions. Additionally, it reviews the efforts performed by the academy and industry to apply different types of robots in the context of firefighting missions. Finally, all this information is used to propose a concept of operation for the comprehensive application of drone swarms in firefighting. The proposed system is a fleet of quadcopters that individually are only able to visit waypoints and use payloads, but collectively can perform tasks of surveillance, mapping, monitoring, etc. Three operator roles are defined, each one with different access to information and functions in the mission: mission commander, team leaders, and team members. These operators take advantage of virtual and augmented reality interfaces to intuitively get the information of the scenario and, in the case of the mission commander, control the drone swarm.},

abstract={Emergency operations are a key example for the need of digital twins in the way it is complex, urgent and uncertain. First, the process is complex, as many organizations are involved. Second, it is urgent, as most damage is done in the first moments of an emergency. Third, it is uncertain, as situational conditions tend to change quickly.For outdoor operations, spatial information systems help in creating an overview of the situation, for example by displaying positions of first responder units involved with the incident. However, spatial data of indoor environments is scarce. Static information of the building, such as floor plans, are often outdated or non-existent. Dynamic operational data such as positions of first responders within the building are only available in a very limited way as well, and often without visual representation.To create situation awareness of indoor first responder operation environments, this paper successfully proposes a proof of concept with two objectives. First, the proof of concept will collect spatial environment data in the form of mapping and tracking data by using a Microsoft HoloLens. This means the geometry of the building will be collected, together with traversed routes within the building. Second, the data will be streamed and displayed to a remote first responder coordinator in real-time to create a common operational picture. This enables the coordinator to quickly build situation awareness of the operation environment, enabling the coordinator to improve the quality of decisions, thereby improving first responder performance. The proof of concept showed that situation awareness on all three levels increases with the real-time (live) availability (visualisations) of 3D indoor environments. This concept needs to be tested further on usability and performance.},

abstract={Innovative technology has been an important part of firefighting, as it advances firefighters’ safety and effectiveness. Prior research has examined the implementation of training systems using augmented reality (AR) in other domains, such as welding, aviation, army, and mathematics, offering significant pedagogical affordances. Nevertheless, firefighting training systems using AR are still an under-researched area. The increasing penetration of AR for training is the driving force behind this study, and the scope is to analyze the main aspects affecting the acceptance of AR by firefighters. The current research uses a technology acceptance model, extended by the external constructs of perceived interactivity and personalization, to consider both the system and individual level. The proposed model was evaluated by a sample of 200 users, and the results show that both the external variables of perceived interactivity and perceived personalization are prerequisite factors in extending the TAM model. The findings reveal that the usability is the strongest predictor of firefighters’ behavioral intentions to use the AR system, followed by the ease of use with smaller, yet meaningful, direct and indirect effects on firefighters’ intentions. The identified acceptance factors help AR developers enhance the firefighters’ experience in training operations.},

Device-to-device communication is one of the key technologies of 5G networks. Internet of Things (IoT) applying 5G infrastructure changes the application scenario in many fields especially real-time communication between machines, data, and people.

abstract={Traditional firefighter helmet has the disadvantages of poor shading and lack of flexibility. AR is the process of computing 3d coordinate points according to the image points of real objects, and then superimposing “virtual + real” surreal scenes based on real scenery through the calculation simulation of the processor. The AR firefighter helmet is a new type of firefighting protective that uses AR technology in traditional firefighter helmet. Intelligent firefighter helmet based on AR technology uses 3D simulation imaging technology, thermal camera tracking technology, human-computer interaction technology, and code recognition technology to maximize the effect of realistic fire scenes. It can enable firefighters to see the real situation in the scene of heavy smoke and improve the efficiency of rescue. Therefore, firefighter helmets with AR equipment represent the future development trend of firefighter helmet. This paper discusses the theory, value, technical operation, design and development of intelligence. The research on the fireman’s helmet based on augmented reality technology has leading advantages and application value.},

abstract={With the use of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) proliferating throughout industry and public safety, it is imperative to ensure safety of flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published regulations for commercial use of sUAS in 2016 and included the requirement to maintain visual line-of-sight with the aircraft at all times. However, due to the nature of the sUAS ground control stations (GCS), remote pilots time-share between observing the aircraft and interacting with the display on the GCS. Time-sharing between the aircraft and GCS can be seen as similar to the cross-check a pilot uses when flying a manned aircraft. While manned aircraft designers have invested in the ergonomics and understanding of the cognitive process to optimize situational awareness, it has not been a design requirement for sUAS. The result is that the unmanned operator must change head orientation, eye focus, and remove the aircraft from peripheral vision during the cross-check between the GCS and aircraft. This, coupled with the limited field of view of the sUAS GCS displayed camera, leads to loss of situational awareness through task saturation, and misprioritization. Mixed reality, virtual reality, and augmented reality visual devices are being adopted in the gaming and technical world. The application of these devices to the sUAS GCS could mitigate some of the degradation of situational awareness. Specifically, the incorporation of augmented reality devices where a synthetic display is overlaid on the real-world, allows the remote pilot to observe the aircraft, manipulate the camera, and interact with the GCS without changing head position. This participant observational study evaluated the difference between the remote pilot cross-check while flying with a typical GCS display and when flying with an augmented reality headset in a field setting. The results indicate a significant difference between the pilot’s crosscheck when using augmented reality glasses allowing the pilot to maintain the aircraft in their field of view 56.7% of the time compared to 20.5% when not using the glasses.},

abstract={Telementoring platforms can help transfer surgical expertise remotely. However, most telementoring platforms are not designed to assist in austere, pre-hospital settings. This paper evaluates the system for telementoring with augmented reality (STAR), a portable and self-contained telementoring platform based on an augmented reality head-mounted display (ARHMD). The system is designed to assist in austere scenarios: a stabilized first-person view of the operating field is sent to a remote expert, who creates surgical instructions that a local first responder wearing the ARHMD can visualize as three-dimensional models projected onto the patient’s body. Our hypothesis evaluated whether remote guidance with STAR could lead to performing a surgical procedure better, as opposed to remote audio-only guidance. Remote expert surgeons guided first responders through training cricothyroidotomies in a simulated austere scenario, and on-site surgeons evaluated the participants using standardized evaluation tools. The evaluation comprehended completion time and technique performance of specific cricothyroidotomy steps. The analyses were also performed considering the participants’ years of experience as first responders, and their experience performing cricothyroidotomies. A linear mixed model analysis showed that using STAR was associated with higher procedural and non-procedural scores, and overall better performance. Additionally, a binary logistic regression analysis showed that using STAR was associated to safer and more successful executions of cricothyroidotomies. This work demonstrates that remote mentors can use STAR to provide first responders with guidance and surgical knowledge, and represents a first step towards the adoption of ARHMDs to convey clinical expertise remotely in austere scenarios.},

abstract={Background: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as simulation technology in emergency medicine education and training, in particular for training nontechnical skills. Experimental studies comparing teaching and learning in VR with traditional training media often demonstrate the equivalence or even superiority regarding particular variables of learning or training effectiveness. Objective: In the EPICSAVE (Enhanced Paramedic Vocational Training with Serious Games and Virtual Environments) project, a highly immersive room-scaled multi-user 3-dimensional VR simulation environment was developed. In this feasibility study, we wanted to gain initial insights into the training effectiveness and media use factors influencing learning and training in VR. Methods: The virtual emergency scenario was anaphylaxis grade III with shock, swelling of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as skin symptoms in a 5-year-old girl (virtual patient) visiting an indoor family amusement park with her grandfather (virtual agent). A cross-sectional, one-group pretest and posttest design was used to evaluate the training effectiveness and quality of the training execution. The sample included 18 active emergency physicians. Results: The 18 participants rated the VR simulation training positive in terms of training effectiveness and quality of the training execution. A strong, significant correlation (r=.53, P=.01) between experiencing presence and assessing training effectiveness was observed. Perceived limitations in usability and a relatively high extraneous cognitive load reduced this positive effect. Conclusions: The training within the virtual simulation environment was rated as an effective educational approach. Specific media use factors appear to modulate training effectiveness (ie, improvement through “experience of presence” or reduction through perceived limitations in usability). These factors should be specific targets in the further development of this VR simulation training.},

abstract={Various technologies have been designed and developed to support communication and coordination between the field and hospital during a medical emergency. The usability issues and human factors entailed in these new technologies are important to their application and effectiveness, suggesting the need to examine this information in a systematic review. The systematic review aims to synthesize the user-centered evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies. We conducted a systematic literature search in four databases (Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science) for articles published between the years 2000 and 2019. We included articles that evaluated the technologies developed for supporting prehospital communication and collaboration, and were published in English. A total of 918 articles were retrieved and screened, with 17 articles included for in-depth analysis. Two authors conducted independent screens and reviews of the articles using a list of inclusion/exclusion criteria and defined factors. The types of technology of reviewed articles included ambulance-based telemedicine, wearable, handheld, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Even though these technologies have demonstrated high levels of user acceptance, the reviewed studies noted a variety of challenges faced by emergency care providers, which were grouped into three categories—technical, usability, and organizational challenges. Our review also highlighted the paucity of evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies and the lack of user engagement throughout system design process. Based on the results, we discuss the importance of adopting user-centered design approaches and accounting for three social-technical factors in designing technologies for time-critical medical settings, including cognitive and physical stressor, workflow, and context. This systematic review presents an overview of key evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies. The paucity of evaluative research in prehospital communication technology and challenges faced in adopting advanced technological solutions in emergency care highlight the need to adopt user-centered design and take into account socio-technical issues at the point of system design.},

abstract={BACKGROUND The potential for disasters has required health care and public health systems to identify and refine their disaster emergency preparedness protocols and constantly improve the quality of health‐care provider disaster education and training. 1–3 Adequate disaster preparedness suffers from limited access to disaster training opportunities and costly and logistically challenging live disaster drills. 3 Alternatively, the increased use of technology in health care has increased patient education and expectations and the implementation of innovative modalities for health care education. 4 Simulation technology helps participants acquire, develop, and maintain the knowledge and skills necessary for safe and effective patient care. 5 High‐fidelity simulation (HFS) is particularly adept at providing a high‐quality environment for developing nontechnical management skills including communication, teamwork, leadership, and decision making, which are necessary when practicing a response to disaster situations. 4 Simulation fidelity is the similarity to reality achieved by the simulator. The following data were extracted using a custom tool: first author and year, data type (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed method), disaster type, disaster setting (country), World Bank status, 7 disaster phase, responders involved, type of HFS technology, problems encountered, findings and significance, and additional comments. Because the primary focus was to characterize the contexts wherein HFS technologies were used rather than methodologic quality, quality assessment metrics were not used in our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Quantitative methods allow you to test a hypothesis by systematically collecting and analyzing data, while qualitative methods allow you to explore ideas and experiences in depth. 2 TableIncluded databases, search terms, and search strategies Included database, search terms, and search strategies Databases PubMed, Embase Search terms Disaster, mass casualty incident, high fidelity simulation, augmented reality, virtual reality Search strategy (PubMed) ((((disasterMeSH Terms]) OR disaster*Text Word]) OR mass casualty incidentMeSH Terms]) OR mass casualty incident*Text Word]) AND (((((((high fidelity simulationMeSH Terms]) OR high fidelity simulation*Text Word]) OR augmented realityMeSH Terms]) OR augmented realit*Text Word]) OR virtual realityMeSH Terms]) OR virtual realit*Text Word])) Search strategy (Embase) (‘disaster’ OR ‘mass casualty incident’) AND (‘high fidelity simulation’ OR ‘augmented reality’ OR ‘augmented realities’ OR ‘virtual reality’ OR ‘virtual realities’) Search counts PubMed: 98 Embase: 96 Total = 194 Field Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Inclusion and exclusion criteria for review Language English only Non‐English language Study design Original research Gray literature, review papers, conference abstracts Year Within 5 years, 2014–2019 More than 5 years Technology application Real‐world event Research presents theoretical application of technology in disaster setting Technology use Augmented reality, virtual reality, high‐fidelity simulation Technology of interest is a survey, etc. Triage Students/paramedical students Yes 11 Kinateder et al. 14 2019 Quantitative Preparedness Germany High income Virtual facility fires Immersive virtual reality environment Evacuation route decision making All Yes 12 Ko et al. 25 2014 Qualitative Prevention/Mitigation preparedness Response resilience United States of America High income Simulated hurricane/food poisoning/power shortage/traffics Computational visual analytics simulation platform Damage assessment Improve},

abstract={This research was motivated by the nurses’ decision-making process in the current emergency department (ED) triage process in the United States. It explores how continuous vital signs monitoring can be integrated into the ED. The article presents four shortcomings on current ED triage systems and proposes a new conceptual clinical decision support model that exploits the benefits of combining wireless wearable devices with Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to address those shortcomings. A literature review was conducted using various engineering and medical research databases, analyzing current practices and identifying potential improvement opportunities. The results from the literature review show that advancements in wireless wearable devices provide opportunities to enhance current ED processes by monitoring patients while they wait after triage and, therefore, reduce the risk of an adverse event. A dynamic mathematical decision support model to prioritize patients is presented, creating a feedback loop in the ED. The coupling of wearable devices (to collect data) with decision theory (to synthesize and organize the information) can assist in reducing sources of uncertainty inherent to ED systems. The authors also address the feasibility of the proposed conceptual model.},

abstract={Rapid assessment of breathing patterns is important for several emergency medical situations. In this research, we developed a non-invasive breathing analysis system that automatically detects different types of breathing patterns of clinical significance. Accelerometer and gyroscopic data were collected from light-weight wireless sensors placed on the chest and abdomen of 100 normal volunteers who simulated various breathing events (central sleep apnea, coughing, obstructive sleep apnea, sighing, and yawning). We then constructed synthetic datasets by injecting annotated examples of the various patterns into segments of normal breathing. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network was implemented to detect the location of each event in each synthetic dataset and to classify it as belonging to one of the above event types. We achieved a mean F1 score of 92% for normal breathing, 87% for central sleep apnea, 72% for coughing, 51% for obstructive sleep apnea, 57% for sighing, and 63% for yawning. These results demonstrate that using deep learning to analyze chest and abdomen movement data from wearable sensors provides an unobtrusive means of monitoring the breathing pattern. This could have application in a number of critical medical situations such as detecting apneas during sleep at home and monitoring breathing events in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit.},

abstract={Across the world, nature-triggered disasters fuelled by climate change are worsening. Some two billion people have been affected by the consequences of natural hazards over the last ten years, 95% of which were weather-related (such as floods and windstorms). Fires swept across large parts of California, and in Australia caused unprecedented destruction to lives, wildlife and bush. This picture is likely to become the new normal, and indeed may worsen if unchecked. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that in some locations, disaster that once had a once-in-a-century frequency may become annual events by 2050.Disaster management needs to keep up. Good cooperation and coordination of crisis response operations are of critical importance to react rapidly and adequately to any crisis situation, while post-disaster recovery presents opportunities to build resilience towards reducing the scale of the next disaster. Technology to support crisis response has advanced greatly in the last few years. Systems for early warning, command and control and decision-making have been successfully implemented in many countries and regions all over the world. Efforts to improve humanitarian response, in particular in relation to combating disasters in rapidly urbanising cities, have also led to better approaches that grapple with complexity and uncertainty.The challenges however are daunting. Many aspects related to the efficient collection and integration of geo-information, applied semantics and situational awareness for disaster management are still open, while agencies, organisations and governmental authorities need to improve their practices for building better resilience.Gi4DM 2020 marked the 13th edition of the Geoinformation for Disaster Management series of conferences. The first conference was held in 2005 in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which claimed the lives of over 220,000 civilians. The 2019-20 Australian Bushfire Season saw some 18.6 million Ha of bushland burn, 5,900 buildings destroyed and nearly three billion vertebrates killed. Gi4DM 2020 then was held during Covid-19 pandemic, which took the lives of more than 1,150,000 people by the time of the conference. The pandemic affected the organisation of the conference, but the situation also provided the opportunity to address important global problems.The fundamental goal of the Gi4DM has always been to provide a forum where emergency responders, disaster managers, urban planners, stakeholders, researchers, data providers and system developers can discuss challenges, share experience, discuss new ideas and demonstrate technology. The 12 previous editions of Gi4DM conferences were held in Delft, the Netherlands (March 2005), Goa, India (September 2006), Toronto, Canada (May 2007), Harbin, China (August 2008), Prague, Czech Republic (January 2009), Torino, Italy (February 2010), Antalya, Turkey (May 2011), Enschede, the Netherlands (December, 2012), Hanoi, Vietnam (December 2013), Montpellier, France (2015), Istanbul, Turkey (2018) and Prague, Czech Republic (2019). Through the years Gi4DM has been organised in cooperation with different international bodies such as ISPRS, UNOOSA, ICA, ISCRAM, FIG, IAG, OGC and WFP and supported by national organisations.Gi4DM 2020 was held as part of Climate Change and Disaster Management: Technology and Resilience for a Troubled World. The event took place through the whole week of 30th of November to 4th of December, Sydney, Australia and included three events: Gi4DM 2020, NSW Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute (NSW SSSI) annual meeting and Urban Resilience Asia Pacific 2 (URAP2).The event explored two interlinked aspects of disaster management in relation to climate change. The first was geo-information technologies and their application for work in crisis situations, as well as sensor and communication networks and their roles for improving situational awareness. The second aspect was resilience, and its role and purpose across the entire cycle of disaster management, from pre-disaster preparedness to post-disaster recovery including challenges and opportunities in relation to rapid urbanisation and the role of security in improved disaster management practices.This volume consists of 16 peer-reviewed scientific papers. These were selected on the basis of double-blind review from among the 25 full papers submitted to the Gi4DM 2020 conference. Each paper was reviewed by three scientific reviewers. The authors of the papers were encouraged to revise, extend and adapt their papers to reflect the comments of the reviewers and fit the goals of this volume. The selected papers concentrate on monitoring and analysis of forest fire (3), landslides (3), flood (2), earthquake, avalanches, water pollution, heat, evacuation and urban sustainability, applying a variety of remote sensing, GIS and Web-based technologies. Figure 1 illustrates the scope of the covered topics though the word count of keywords and titles.The Gi4DM 2020 program consisted of scientific presentations, keynote speeches, panel discussions and tutorials. The four keynotes speakers Prof Suzan Cutter (Hazard and Vulnerability Research Institute, USC, US), Jeremy Fewtrell (NSW Fire and Rescue, Australia), Prof Orhan Altan (Ad-hoc Committee on RISK and Disaster Management, GeoUnions, Turkey) and Prof Philip Gibbins (Fenner School of Environment and Society, ANU, Australia) concentrated on different aspects of disaster and risk management in the context of climate change. Eight tutorials offered exciting workshops and hands-on on: Semantic web tools and technologies within Disaster Management, Structure-from-motion photogrammetry, Radar Remote Sensing, Dam safety: Monitoring subsidence with SAR Interferometry, Location-based Augmented Reality apps with Unity and Mapbox, Visualising bush fires datasets using open source, Making data smarter to manage disasters and emergency situational awareness and Response using HERE Location Services. The scientific sessions were blended with panel discussions to provide more opportunities to exchange ideas and experiences, connect people and researchers from all over the world.The editors of this volume acknowledge all members of the scientific committee for their time, careful review and valuable comments: Abdoulaye Diakité (Australia), Alexander Rudloff (Germany), Alias Abdul Rahman (Malaysia), Alper Yilmaz (USA), Amy Parker (Australia), Ashraf Dewan (Australia), Bapon Shm Fakhruddin (New Zealand), Batuhan Osmanoglu (USA), Ben Gorte (Australia), Bo Huang (Hong Kong), Brendon McAtee (Australia), Brian Lee (Australia), Bruce Forster (Australia), Charity Mundava (Australia), Charles Toth (USA), Chris Bellman (Australia), Chris Pettit (Australia), Clive Fraser (Australia), Craig Glennie (USA), David Belton (Australia), Dev Raj Paudyal (Australia), Dimitri Bulatov (Germany), Dipak Paudyal (Australia), Dorota Iwaszczuk (Germany), Edward Verbree (The Netherlands), Eliseo Clementini (Italy), Fabio Giulio Tonolo (Italy), Fazlay Faruque (USA), Filip Biljecki (Singapore), Petra Helmholz (Australia), Francesco Nex (The Netherlands), Franz Rottensteiner (Germany), George Sithole (South Africa), Graciela Metternicht (Australia), Haigang Sui (China), Hans-Gerd Maas (Germany), Hao Wu (China), Huayi Wu (China), Ivana Ivanova (Australia), Iyyanki Murali Krishna (India), Jack Barton (Australia), Jagannath Aryal (Australia), Jie Jiang (China), Joep Compvoets (Belgium), Jonathan Li (Canada), Kourosh Khoshelham (Australia), Krzysztof Bakuła (Poland), Lars Bodum (Denmark), Lena Halounova (Czech Republic), Madhu Chandra (Germany), Maria Antonia Brovelli (Italy), Martin Breunig (Germany), Martin Tomko (Australia), Mila Koeva (The Netherlands), Mingshu Wang (The Netherlands), Mitko Aleksandrov (Australia), Mulhim Al Doori (UAE), Nancy Glenn (Australia), Negin Nazarian (Australia), Norbert Pfeifer (Austria), Norman Kerle (The Netherlands), Orhan Altan (Turkey), Ori Gudes (Australia), Pawel Boguslawski (Poland), Peter van Oosterom (The Netherlands), Petr Kubíček (Czech Republic), Petros Patias (Greece), Piero Boccardo (Italy), Qiaoli Wu (China), Qing Zhu (China), Riza Yosia Sunindijo (Australia), Roland Billen (Belgium), Rudi Stouffs (Singapore), Scott Hawken (Australia), Serene Coetzee (South Africa), Shawn Laffan (Australia), Shisong Cao (China), Sisi Zlatanova (Australia), Songnian Li (Canada), Stephan Winter (Australia), Tarun Ghawana (Australia), Ümit Işıkdağ (Turkey), Wei Li (Australia), Wolfgang Reinhardt (Germany), Xianlian Liang (Finland) and Yanan Liu (China).The editors would like to express their gratitude to all contributors, who made this volume possible.

abstract={The increase in the adoption of wearable fitness trackers has led to their inclusion as valuable evidence used by law enforcement during investigations. The information available in these fitness trackers can be used by law enforcement to prosecute or exonerate an individual. Wearable fitness devices are constantly being released by companies, with new firmware created for each iteration. As technology developers, research and law enforcement must keep pace to take advantage of data that can be used in investigations. The Fitbit line of devices is a popular brand of wearable trackers. This study will investigate what artifacts are generated by the new Fitbit Versa 2 by investigating what data are generated and stored on the smartphone app component of the new device. The artifacts discovered will be related to areas of forensic interest that are relevant to a law enforcement officer or digital forensics practitioner. Previous research and their methodologies used for application and mobile forensics will be used to conduct this research. This study finds the Fitbit Versa 2, and by extension, the Fitbit smartphone application does not store social media message notifications pushed to the tracker by the user’s mobile device. Some credit card information, health-related data, such as heart rate, GPS locations, and other potentially identifying data were found in plaintext. While the exposed data is not enough on its own to pose an immediate serious issue, it can be used as leverage to phish a user for further details.},

abstract={New, emerging technologies, transform every day our life and have direct consequence on our health and well-being. More and more wearable medical devices (MD) with wireless communication technologies embedded are being developed by innovative academic community and companies. Optical wireless communication (OWC) consisting of Visible Light Communication (VLC), infrared (IR), Optical Camera Communication (OCC) and Light Fidelity (LiFi) along with the conventional Radio Frequency (RF) wireless communication are suitable technologies to be used for hybrid Wireless Integrated Medical Assistance Systems (WIMAS). The WIMAS addressed in this paper consists of two Wireless Medical Body Area Networks (WMBAN) (an insulin wearable kit and an ECG test device with VLC/OCC are considered) and an Emergency Remote Medical Assistance (ERMA) with LiFi technology embedded. Using RF in medical facilities is subject of strict regulations due to interferences with other RF medical devices, negative effects on human health and lack of security. VLC and OCC are suitable to be embedded in MDs in order to be used by the patients with wearable WMBAN. Research on IR transdermal communication for implantable MDs has also been demonstrated as feasible and both VLC and OCC have promising future, as well. On the other hand, LiFi technology, recently deployed on the market, is mature enough to be integrated in the ERMA system addressed here.},

abstract={PurposeLaw enforcement officers (LEOs) suffer from premature mortality, intentional and unintentional injury, suicide and are at an increased risk for several non-communicable disease outcomes including cardiovascular disease and several cancers, compared to those employed in other occupations. Repeated exposure to stressful and traumatic stimuli is a possible mechanism driving these adverse health outcomes among LEOs. To better identify the sources of these health problems, the purpose of this paper is to determine the feasibility of conducting a cohort study using physiological measures of stress (e.g. heart rate) with LEOs; perceptions of the FitBit device, including LEO buy-in and attitudes associated with the protocol.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from ten recent graduates of the Dallas Police Training Academy.FindingsResults suggest that officer buy-in and protocol compliance was high. Officers were eager to participate in this study, and completion of weekly surveys was 100 percent. Minute-level missing data from wearable devices was relatively low (25 percent), and 90 percent of participants wore the FitBit devices on more than 90 percent of study days.Originality/valueResults from this study suggest that wearable physiological devices can be effectively used in law enforcement populations to measure stress.},

abstract={Background:Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals face high physical demands in high-stress settings; however, the prevalence of cardiovascular health (CVH) risk factors in this health care workforce has not been explored. The primary objective of this study was to compare the distribution of CVH and its individual components between a sample of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. The secondary objective was to identify associations between demographic and employment characteristics with ideal CVH in EMS professionals.Methods:A cross-sectional survey based on the American Heart Association’s (AHA; Dallas, Texas USA) Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) was administered to nationally-certified EMTs and paramedics. The LS7 components were scored according to previously described cut points (ideal = 2; intermediate = 1; poor = 0). A composite CVH score (0-10) was calculated from the component scores, excluding cholesterol and blood glucose due to missing data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR; 95% CI) for demographic and employment characteristics associated with optimal CVH (≥7 points).Results:There were 24,708 respondents that were currently practicing and included. More EMTs achieved optimal CVH (n = 4,889; 48.8%) compared to paramedics (n = 4,338; 40.6%). Factors associated with higher odds of optimal CVH included: higher education level (eg, college graduate or more: OR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.97-2.59); higher personal income (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.37); and working in an urban versus rural area (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.23-1.40). Paramedic certification level (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91), older age (eg, 50 years or older: OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.73), male sex (OR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.50-0.56), working for a non-fire-based agency (eg, private service: OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62-0.74), and providing medical transport service (OR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.94) were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH.Conclusions:Several EMS-related characteristics were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH. Future studies should focus on better understanding the CVH and metabolic risk profiles for EMS professionals and their association with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), major cardiac events, and occupational mortality.Cash RE, Crowe RP, Bower JK, Foraker RE, Panchal AR.

abstract={Introduction:As Israel's National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provider, Magen David Adom (MDA) is constantly looking for ways to improve the response to mass casualty incidents (MCIs). Previous research has shown that in an MCI situation, the demand for resources is disproportionate to the available resources, thus creating a dilemma of how to triage and treat the patients, as well as how to best prioritize and treat the critical patients.Aim:Smartwatches have become an integral part of society. MDA constantly looks for ways to integrate new technologies into their emergency response protocols. Smartwatches were used in this experiment to determine if in an MCI, relaying live information to the dispatch center would improve the time it takes for emergency crews to effectively treat and transport critical patients.Methods:A drill and scenario were designed to simulate an MCI in which there were 3 severe, 2 moderate, and 5 lightly wounded patients. There were then different colored smartwatches placed on each victim. The watches transmitted real-time blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation readings to the dispatch center. The live information was transferred directly to responding teams. A second drill was conducted using the same scenario, same number of patients, but without watches to examine the differences in response times.Results:MDA found that the use of smartwatches directly improved the times (by 3.27 minutes) in which emergency teams were able to reach the most severely wounded patients and evacuate them to the hospital in a timely manner.Discussion:Using smartwatches to transmit live information to the dispatch center allowed for effective treatment and transport of patients in an MCI. Use of such information allows the dispatch center to direct teams to provide accurate treatment to the patients according to their needs.},

abstract={On-site work of emergency service teams consists of highly cooperative tasks. Especially during distributed search and rescue tasks there is a constant mix of routinized and non-routinized activities. Within this paper we focus on the work practices of the German Red Cross Rescue Dog Units who deal with several uncertainties regarding the involved dogs, the fragility of the respective situations as well as issues of using technologies under enormous time pressure. Smart glasses provide possibilities for enhanced and hands-free interaction in various contexts and a number of approaches have already been applied, aiming at efficient use of the respective technological innovation in private and professional contexts. However, the collaborative potential of smart glasses in time-critical and uncertain situations is still unexplored. Our design case study examines how the on-site work of emergency service teams can be supported by smart glasses: Based on examining the work practices of the German Red Cross Rescue Dogs, we introduce ‘RescueGlass’ as a coordinative concept, encompassing hands-free head-mounted display (HMD) application as well as a corresponding smartphone application. Finally, we describe the evaluation of its use in the field of emergency response and management. We show how current features such as ‘fog of war’ or various sensors support the cooperative practices of dog handlers, and outline current technical limitations offering future research questions. Our paper provides an initial design probe using smart glasses to engage in the field of collaborative professional mobile tasks.},

abstract={PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to answer the question of whether smartwatches will survive and gain their own niche within the consumer electronics market. Based on the stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) framework, this study identifies and validates the impacts of both technological and fashion-related factors (interactivity, autonomy, visual aesthetics and self-expression) on product attachment towards smartwatches through user satisfaction and pleasure derived from their smartwatches.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected the survey data via online surveys from 198 respondents and tested measurement and structural models with the partial least square technique.FindingsThe authors found that both technological characteristics (interactivity and autonomy) and fashion-related characteristics (visual aesthetics and self-expression) have an impact on product attachment through pleasure.Research limitations/implicationsSeveral other important characteristics of traditional wrist-watches such as durability or workmanship are not considered in this study, but should be included in future studies. The three-item measure of autonomy may be insufficient for more sophisticated wearable devices in the future. In future studies, the impact of product attachment on users’ continued usage should be examined.Practical implicationsThis study provides important practical implications for smartwatch makers interested in product development, as users were found to consider fashion-related characteristics to be as important as technological characteristics.Originality/valueThis study is the first study that considers both aesthetic and technological factors for IT acceptance in the context of wearable devices. Also, instead of traditional IT acceptance measures such as continued use, this study investigates users’ product attachment, which is more relevant to the case of wearable devices.},

abstract={Objectives. To investigate the impact of an integrated care model on the healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) of formerly chronically homeless individuals in permanent supportive housing. Methods. From 2014 to 2017, eligible individuals in Houston, Texas (n = 323), were placed in 1 of 2 permanent supportive housing service delivery models. Both models included coordinated care teams. In the intervention group, teams had a single plan of care with the partnering clinic. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 36-item Short Form Survey were administered at baseline and every 6 months for 30 months. We assessed intervention group emergency department use at 2 years. We evaluated change by using hierarchical linear growth models. Results. There was a significant and clinically meaningful increase in HRQOL in the intervention group, with the intervention group reporting improvement over the comparison group. Intervention group emergency department use decreased by 70% (no comparison group). Conclusions. Those in the intervention group with a single, coordinated plan of care reported significant and clinically meaningful increases in their HRQOL. Public Health Implications. Coordinated care models have potential to reduce societal costs and increase HRQOL, providing a financial and humanitarian justification for the continued investment in collaborative care in permanent supportive housing.},

abstract={Due to multiple reasons, emergency wards can become overloaded with patients, some of which can be in critical health conditions. To improve the emergency service and avoid deaths and serious adverse events that could be potentially prevented, it is mandatory to do a continuous monitoring of patients physiological parameters. This is a good fit for Internet of Things (IoT) technology, but the scenario imposes hard constraints on autonomy, connectivity, interoperability, and delay. In this paper, we propose a full Internet-based architecture using open protocols from the wearable sensors up to the monitoring system. Particularly, we use low-cost and low-power WiFi-enabled wearable physiological sensors that connect directly to the Internet infrastructure and run open communication protocols, namely, oneM2M. At the upper end, our architecture relies on openEHR for data semantics, storage, and monitoring. Overall, we show the feasibility of our open IoT architecture exhibiting 20–50 ms end-to-end latency and 30–50 h sensor autonomy at a fraction of the cost of current non-interoperable vertical solutions.},

abstract={Simulation-based training has been proven to be a highly effective pedagogical strategy. However, misalignment between the participant’s level of expertise and the difficulty of the simulation has been shown to have significant negative impact on learning outcomes. To ensure that learning outcomes are achieved, we propose a novel framework for adaptive simulation with the goal of identifying the level of expertise of the learner, and dynamically modulating the simulation complexity to match the learner’s capability. To facilitate the development of this framework, we investigate the classification of expertise using biological signals monitored through wearable sensors. Trauma simulations were developed in which electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals of both novice and expert trauma responders were collected. These signals were then utilized to classify the responders’ expertise, successive to feature extraction and selection, using a number of machine learning methods. The results show the feasibility of utilizing these bio-signals for multimodal expertise classification to be used in adaptive simulation applications.},

abstract={Due to hot toxic smoke and unknown risks under fire conditions, detection and relevant reconnaissance are significant in avoiding casualties. A fire reconnaissance robot was therefore developed to assist in the problem by offering important fire information to fire fighters. The robot consists of three main systems, a display operating system, video surveillance, and mapping and positioning navigation. Augmented reality (AR) goggle technology with a display operating system was also developed to free fire fighters’ hands, which enables them to focus on rescuing processes and not system operation. Considering smoke disturbance, a thermal imaging video surveillance system was included to extract information from the complicated fire conditions. Meanwhile, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology was adopted to build the map, together with the help of a mapping and positioning navigation system. This can provide a real-time map under the rapidly changing fire conditions to guide the fire fighters to the fire sources or the trapped occupants. Based on our experiments, it was found that all the tested system components work quite well under the fire conditions, while the video surveillance system produces clear images under dense smoke and a high-temperature environment; SLAM shows a high accuracy with an average error of less than 3.43%; the positioning accuracy error is 0.31 m; and the maximum error for the navigation system is 3.48%. The developed fire reconnaissance robot can provide a practically important platform to improve fire rescue efficiency to reduce the fire casualties of fire fighters.},

abstract={Homelessness during pregnancy poses significant health risks for mothers and infants. As health care providers increase their emphasis on social determinants of health, it is important to understand how unstable housing contributes to complications during pregnancy. We linked data about emergency shelter enrollees with Massachusetts Medicaid claims for the period January 1, 2008-June 30, 2015 to compare health care use and pregnancy complications for 9,124 women who used emergency shelter with those for 8,757 similar women who did not. Rates of mental illness and substance use disorders were significantly higher among homeless women. Adjusted odds of having nine pregnancy complications were also significantly higher for homeless women and remained substantially unchanged after we adjusted for behavioral health disorders. Emergency shelter users also had fewer ambulatory care visits and more months without billable care and were more likely to visit an emergency department. Homelessness and behavioral health disorders appear to be independent factors contributing to pregnancy complications and should be addressed simultaneously.},

abstract={Researchers have identified lifestyle diseases as a major threat to human civilization. These diseases gradually progress without giving any warning and result in a sudden health aggravation that leads to a medical emergency. As such, individuals can only avoid the life-threatening condition if they regularly monitor their health status. Health recommendation systems allow users to continuously monitor their health and deliver proper health advice to them. Also, continuous health monitoring depends on the real-time data exchange between health solution providers and users. In this regard, healthcare providers have begun to use wearable devices and recommendation systems to collect data in real time and to manage health conditions based on the generated data. However, we lack literature that has examined how individuals use wearable devices, what type of data the devices collect, and how providers use the data for delivering solutions to users. Thus, we decided to explore the available literature in this domain to understand how wearable devices can provide solutions to consumers. We also extended our focus to cover current health service delivery frameworks with the help of recommender systems. Thus, this study reviews health-monitoring services by conglomerating both wearable device and recommendation system to come up with personalized health and fitness solutions. Additionally, the paper elucidates key components of an advanced-level real-time monitoring service framework to guide future research and practice in this domain.},

abstract={Recently, fire accidents in buildings have become bigger around the world, and it has become necessary to build an efficient building disaster management system suitable for fires in a Smart City. As building fires increase the number of casualties and property damage, it is necessary to take appropriate action accordingly. There has been an increasing effort to develop such disaster management systems worldwide by applying information communication technology (ICT), and many studies have been conducted in practice. In this paper, an augmented reality (AR)-based Smart Building and Town Disaster Management System is suggested in order to acquire visibility and to grasp occupants in case of fire disasters in buildings. This system provides visualization information and optimal guide for quick initial response by utilizing smart element AR-based disaster management service through linkage of physical virtual domain in the building. Additionally, we show a scenario flow chart of the fire extinguishment process according to the time from the ignition stage to the extinguishment stage in the building. Finally, we introduce the related sensors, the actuators, and a small test-bed for AR-based disaster management service.

abstract={Background One component of the 2009 Chinese health care reform plan is to train general practitioners to improve the delivery of primary care services. This continuing professional development is expected to further improve the physicians’ competencies to be general practitioners in primary care. Augmented reality–a combination of virtual information and the real environment–may enhance general practitioners’ continuing professional development by allowing their learning experiences to overlap with their workplace practice. Objective To explore the needs, opportunities, and challenges involved in continuing professional development for Chinese physicians becoming competent general practitioners within primary care, with a special focus on the possibilities of applying augmented reality. Methods This study used a qualitative approach with semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Two managers and thirteen physicians (from four community health centers and stations) participated. The data were analyzed using a thematic inductive analysis approach. Results Based on our interviews, most of the physicians were not fully trained as general practitioners but still assumed the duties of that position; they were supposed to eventually become fully trained in line with the reforms of the Chinese primary care system. However, they reported a lack of in-service training opportunities to fulfill this goal. Even those who said that they had such opportunities perceived the efficacy of that training as being poor. The managers and most of the physicians reacted positively to the idea of using augmented reality in continuing professional development, and they suggested antibiotics treatment, surgery, and emergency care as learning areas in which augmented reality could be applied. Conclusions Due to the Chinese reforms of the primary care system, both managers and the physicians themselves expect general practitioners to become qualified by engaging in continuing professional development. Both groups also regarded augmented reality as a potentially useful tool.},

abstract={BackgroundHealthcare providers and law enforcement (LE) officers are among the most common first responders to injuring events. Despite frequent interface between the health system (HS) and LE sectors, the published evidence that supports their collaboration in injury surveillance, control and prevention has not been comprehensively reviewed.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of literature published from 1990 to 2016 that focused on local and regional HS and LE collaborations in injury surveillance, control and prevention. Our aim was to describe what is known and what remains unexplored about these cross-sector efforts.Results128 articles were included in the final review. These were categorised by their focus on either surveillance activities or partnerships in injury control and prevention programmes. The majority of surveillance articles focused on road traffic injuries. Conversely, articles describing partnerships and programme evaluations primarily targeted the prevention of interpersonal violence.DiscussionThis review yielded two major findings: overall, the combination of HS and LE injury data added value to surveillance systems, especially as HS data augmented LE data; and HS and LE partnerships have been developed to improve injury control and prevention. However, there are few studies that have evaluated the impact and sustainability of these partnerships.ConclusionsThe current evidence to support HS and LE collaboration in injury surveillance and control and prevention programmes is heterogeneous. Notable gaps suggest ample opportunity for further research and programme evaluation across all types of injury.},

abstract={BackgroundUse of ketamine in the prehospital setting may be advantageous due to its potent analgesic and sedative properties and favorable risk profile. Use in the military setting has demonstrated both efficacy and safety for pain relief. The purpose of this study was to assess ketamine training, use, and perceptions in the civilian setting among nationally certified paramedics (NRPs) in the United States.MethodsA cross-sectional survey of NRPs was performed. The electronic questionnaire assessed paramedic training, authorization, use, and perceptions of ketamine. Included in the analysis were completed surveys of paramedics who held one or more state paramedic credentials, indicated “patient care provider” as their primary role, and worked in non-military settings. Descriptive statistics were calculated.ResultsA total of 14,739 responses were obtained (response rate=23%), of which 10,737 (73%) met inclusion criteria and constituted the study cohort. Over one-half (53%) of paramedics reported learning about ketamine during their initial paramedic training. Meanwhile, 42% reported seeking ketamine-related education on their own. Of all respondents, only 33% (3,421/10,737) were authorized by protocol to use ketamine. Most commonly authorized uses included pain management (55%), rapid sequence intubation (RSI; 72%), and chemical restraint/sedation (72%). One-third of authorized providers (1,107/3,350) had never administered ketamine, with another 32% (1,070/3,350) having administered ketamine less than five times in their career. Ketamine was perceived to be safe and effective as the vast majority reported that they were comfortable with the use of ketamine (94%) and would, in similar situations (95%), use it again.ConclusionThis was the first large, national survey to assess ketamine training, use, and perceptions among paramedics in the civilian prehospital setting. While training related to ketamine use was commonly reported among paramedics, few were authorized to administer the drug by their agency’s protocols. Of those authorized to use ketamine, most paramedics had limited experience administering the drug. Future research is needed to determine why the prevalence of ketamine use is low and to assess the safety and efficacy of ketamine use in the prehospital setting.BucklandDM, CroweRP, CashRE, GondekS, MalusoP, SirajuddinS, SmithER, DangerfieldP, ShapiroG, WankaC, PanchalAR, SaraniB.

abstract={Rural India lacks easy access to health practitioners and medical centers, depending instead on community health workers. In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient’s health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to Internet.},

In doing so, it shows how debates about wearable cameras reflect broader cultural tensions surrounding race and privilege.Design/methodology/approachThe paper employs a form of critical discourse analysis to discover patterns in journalistic coverage of these two technologies.FindingsPublic response to Glass has been overwhelmingly negative, while response to body cameras has been positive. Analysis indicates that this contrasting response reflects a consistent public concern about the dynamics of power and privilege in the digital economy. While this concern is well-founded, news coverage indicates that technologists, policy makers and citizens each hold assumptions about the inevitability and unvarnished beneficence of technology.Research limitations/implicationsSince this qualitative approach seeks to discern broad emergent patterns, it does not employ a quantifiable and reproducible coding schema.Practical implicationsThe article concludes by arguing that grassroots action, appropriate regulatory policy and revitalized systems of professional journalism are indispensable as the struggle for social justice unfolds in the emerging digital economy.Social implicationsThese debates represent a struggle over what and how people see. Yet public discourse often glosses over the disadvantages of technological change, which impacts who is able to amass social power.Originality/valueThis comparative approach yields unique conceptual insight into debates about technologies that augment ways of seeing.},

abstract={Since 9/11, the fire service has experienced a shift and an expansion in the nature of threats and hazards that it faces. Despite advances in the field, firefighters are still losing their lives inside of burning buildings, and they must find new ways of identifying training gaps and improving current training practices. This thesis explores whether emergency incidents connected to low frequency and high risk events contain sufficient warning signs or indicators of imminent catastrophic events, if firefighters could identify them, and if there was a potential of changing decision making and averting a tragedy. In order to create a firm basis for this discovery, this research effort included a detailed analysis of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s line of duty death reports from the years 2013– 2015. The work provided an opportunity to learn from past events and practices and identify successes and failures in the firefighting domain without the bias of being closely involved with the cases or having a specific agenda. Quantitative analysis performed on this data set and the knowledge gleaned from looking at the events after the fact provide a foundation for advising novel training approaches and scenarios that can be used to train both individuals and teams of fire fighters.

abstract={The UK Defence Medical Service's Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) capability includes rapid-deployment Medical Emergency Response Teams (MERTs) comprising tri-service trauma consultants, paramedics and specialised nurses, all of whom are qualified to administer emergency care under extreme conditions to improve the survival prospects of combat casualties. The pre-deployment training of MERT personnel is designed to foster individual knowledge, skills and abilities in PHEC and in small team performance and cohesion in 'mission-specific' contexts. Until now, the provision of airborne pre-deployment MERT training had been dependent on either the availability of an operational aircraft (eg, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter) or access to one of only two ground-based facsimiles of the Chinook's rear cargo/passenger cabin. Although MERT training has high priority, there will always be competition with other military taskings for access to helicopter assets (and for other platforms in other branches of the Armed Forces). This paper describes the development of an inexpensive, reconfigurable and transportable MERT training concept based on 'mixed reality' technologies-in effect the 'blending' of real-world objects of training relevance with virtual reality reconstructions of operational contexts.},

abstract={Introduction The staffing of ambulances with different levels of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers is a difficult decision with evidence being mixed on the benefit of each model. Hypothesis/Problem The objective of this study was to describe a pilot program evaluating alternative staffing on two ambulances utilizing the paramedic-basic (PB) model (staffed with one paramedic and one emergency medical technicianEMT]). Methods This was a retrospective study conducted from September 17, 2013 through December 31, 2013. The PB ambulances were compared to geographically matched ambulances staffed with paramedic-paramedic (PP ambulances). One PP and one PB ambulance were based at Station A; one PP and one PB ambulance were based at Station B. The primary outcome was total on-scene time. Secondary outcomes included time-to-electrocardiogram (EKG), time-to-intravenous (IV) line insertion, IV-line success rate, and percentage of protocol violations. Inclusion criteria were all patients requesting prehospital services that were attended to by these teams. Patients were excluded if they were not attended to by the study ambulance vehicles. Descriptive statistics were reported as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Proportions were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Mann-Whitley U test was used for significance testing (P<.05). Results Median on-scene times at Station A for the PP ambulance were shorter than the PB ambulance team (PP: 10.1 minutes, IQR 6.0-15; PB: 13.0 minutes, IQR 8.1-18; P=.01). This finding also was noted at Station B (PP: 13.5 minutes, IQR 8.5-19; PB: 14.3 minutes, IQR 9.9-20; P=.01). There were no differences between PP and PB ambulance teams at Station A or Station B in time-to-EKG, time-to-IV insertion, IV success rate, and protocol violation rates. Conclusion In the setting of a well-developed EMS system utilizing an all-Advanced Life Support (ALS) response, this study suggests that PB ambulance teams may function well when compared to PP ambulances. Though longer scene times were observed, differences in time to ALS interventions and protocol violation rates were not different. Hybrid ambulance teams may be an effective staffing alternative, but decisions to use this model must address clinical and operational concerns. Cortez EJ , Panchal AR , Davis JE , Keseg DP .

abstract={Introduction Research suggests Emergency Medical Services (EMS) over-use in urban cities is partly due to substance users with limited access to medical/social services. Recent efforts to deliver brief, motivational messages to encourage these individuals to enter treatment have not considered EMS providers. Problem Little research has been done with EMS providers who serve substance-using patients. The EMS providers were interviewed about participating in a pilot program where they would be trained to screen their patients for substance abuse and encourage them to enter drug treatment. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD; Baltimore, Maryland USA) EMS providers (N=22). Topics included EMS misuse, work demands, and views on participating in the pilot program. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory and constant-comparison. Results Participants were mostly white (68.1%); male (68.2%); with Advanced Life Skills training (90.9%). Mean age was 37.5 years. Providers described the "frequent flyer problem" (eg, EMS over-use by a few repeat non-emergent cases). Providers expressed disappointment with local health delivery due to resource limitations and being excluded from decision making within their administration, leading to reduced team morale and burnout. Nonetheless, providers acknowledged they are well-positioned to intervene with substance-using patients because they are in direct contact and have built rapport with them. They noted patients might be most receptive to motivational messages immediately after overdose revival, which several called "hitting their bottom." Several stated that involvement with the proposed study would be facilitated by direct incorporation into EMS providers' current workflow. Many recommended that research team members accompany EMS providers while on-call to observe their day-to-day work. Barriers identified by the providers included time constraints to intervene, limited knowledge of substance abuse treatment modalities, and fearing negative repercussions from supervisors and/or patients. Despite reservations, several EMS providers expressed inclination to deliver brief motivational messages to encourage substance-using patients to consider treatment, given adequate training and skill-building. Conclusions Emergency Medical Service providers may have many demands, including difficult case time/resource limitations. Even so, participants recognized their unique position as first responders to deliver motivational, harm-reduction messages to substance-using patients during transport. With incentivized training, implementing this program could be life- and cost-saving, improving emergency and behavioral health services. Findings will inform future efforts to connect substance users with drug treatment, potentially reducing EMS over-use in Baltimore. Maragh-Bass AC , Fields JC , McWilliams J , Knowlton AR .

abstract={The concept of vulnerability has been employed to develop transport systems that sustain devastating disasters and ensure the efficient evacuation of neighborhoods. Existing studies of road network vulnerability overlook two important aspects of analysis: the no-notice evacuation and the different objectives of evacuees and first responders. First, a no-notice evacuation leaves limited time for proactive emergency planning; therefore, rescue strategies in this scenario rely heavily on real-time traffic information. Second, the goal of first responders in an evacuation is to move into an affected area immediately after a hazardous event unfolds, and the risk they face differs from that of evacuees. To this end, this paper develops a network-based model to evaluate vulnerability during a no-notice evacuation and applies it to a case study in Dublin, OH, USA. The model is suited to assessing network vulnerability in response to events with uncertainty and coordinating traffic control strategies in a no-notice evacuation. This study can become a valuable complement to the methodological conceptualization of vulnerability and can provide insights into developing comprehensive emergency management plans.},

abstract={Traditionally, rural areas in many countries are limited by a lack of access to health care due to the inherent challenges associated with recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals. Telemedicine, which uses communication technology to deliver medical services over distance, is an economical and potentially effective way to address this problem. In this research, we develop a new telepresence application using an Augmented Reality (AR) system. We explore the use of the Microsoft HoloLens to facilitate and enhance remote medical training. Intrinsic advantages of AR systems enable remote learners to perform complex medical procedures such as Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) without visual interference. This research uses the HoloLens to capture the first-person view of a simulated rural emergency room (ER) through mixed reality capture (MRC) and serves as a novel telemedicine platform with remote pointing capabilities. The mentor’s hand gestures are captured using a Leap Motion and virtually displayed in the AR space of the HoloLens. To explore the feasibility of the developed platform, twelve novice medical trainees were guided by a mentor through a simulated ultrasound exploration in a trauma scenario, as part of a pilot user study. The study explores the utility of the system from the trainees, mentor, and objective observers’ perspectives and compares the findings to that of a more traditional multi-camera telemedicine solution. The results obtained provide valuable insight and guidance for the development of an AR-supported telemedicine platform.},

abstract={In the domain of emergency management, in addition to the constant technical skill-upgrade required by the nature of the humanitarian context, the importance of an appropriate training is widely recognized. In particular, giving responders information technology skills so that they are well prepared to address health, security and managerial concerns represents a key factor by which the goal of an efficient and effective humanitarian emergency response can be pursued. In this paper we propose the adoption of augmented reality mobile interfaces to enhance the training efficacy for on-site crisis preparedness activities. The system we propose originated from the idea to allow trainees to exploit Augmented Reality (AR) interaction and become quickly familiar with the mobile technology adopted today in emergency response activities.},

abstract={Physiological parameter monitoring may be useful in many different groups of the population, such as infants, elderly people, athletes, soldiers, drivers, fire-fighters, police etc. This can provide a variety of information ranging from health status to operational readiness. In this article, we focus on the case of first responders and specifically fire-fighters. Firefighters can benefit from a physiological monitoring system that is used to extract multiple indications such as the present position, the possible life risk level, the stress level etc. This work presents a wearable wireless sensor network node, based on low cost, commercial-off- the-self (COTS) electronic modules, which can be easily attached on a standard fire-fighters’ uniform. Due to the low frequency wired interface between the selected electronic components, the proposed solution can be used as a basis for a textile system where all wired connections will be implemented by means of conductive yarn routing in the textile structure, while some of the standard sensors can be replaced by textile ones. System architecture is described in detail, while indicative samples of acquired signals are also presented.},

abstract={The communication infrastructure among various interconnected devices has revolutionized the process of collecting and sharing information. This evolutionary paradigm of collecting, storing and analyzing data streams is called the Internet of Everything (IoE). The information exchange through IoE is fast and accurate but leaves security issues. The emergence of IoE has seen a drift from a single novel technology to several technological developments. Managing various technologies under one infrastructure is complex especially when a network is openly allowing nodes to access it. Access transition of infrastructures from closed networked environments to the public internets has raised security issues. The consistent growth in IoE technology is recognized as a bridge between physical, virtual and cross-cultural worlds. Modern enterprises are becoming reliant on interconnected wireless intelligent devices and this has put billions of user’s data in risk. The interference and intrusion in any infrastructure have opened the door of public safety concerns because this interception could compromise the user’s personal data as well as personal privacy. This research aims to adopt a holistic approach to devising a secure IoE architecture for cross-culture communication organizations, with attention paid to the various technological wearable devices, their security policies, communication protocols, data format and data encryption features to avoid the data exploitation. A systems methodology will be adopted with a view to developing a secure IoE model which provides for a generic implementation after analyzing the critical security features to minimize the risk of data exploitations. This would combine the ability of IoE to connect, communicate, and remotely manage an incalculable number of networked, automated devices with the security properties of authentication, availability, integrity and confidentiality on a configurable basis. This will help clarify issues currently present and narrow down security threats planning considerably.},

abstract={Rapid and accurate assessment of the state of buildings in the aftermath of a disaster event is critical for an effective and timely response. For rapid damage assessment of buildings, the utility of remote sensing (RS) technology has been widely researched, with focus on a range of platforms and sensors. However, RS-based approaches still have limitations to assess structural integrity and the specific damage status of individual buildings. Structural integrity refers to the ability of a building to hold the entire structure. Consequently, ground-based assessment conducted by structural engineers and first responders is still required. This paper demonstrates the concept of mobile augmented reality (mAR) to improve performance of building damage and safety assessment in situ. Mobile AR provides a means to superimpose various types of reference or pre-disaster information (virtual data) on actual post-disaster building data (real buildings). To adopt mobile AR, this study defines a conceptual framework based on the level of complexity (LOC). The framework consists of four LOCs, and for each of these, the data types, required processing steps, AR implementation and use for damage assessment are described. Based on this conceptualization we demonstrate prototypes of mAR for both indoor and outdoor purposes. Finally, we conduct a user evaluation of the prototypes to validate the mAR approach for building damage and safety assessment.},

abstract={How people move in cities and what they do in various locations at different times form human activity patterns. Human activity pattern plays a key role in in urban planning, traffic forecasting, public health and safety, emergency response, friend recommendation, and so on. Therefore, scholars from different fields, such as social science, geography, transportation, physics and computer science, have made great efforts in modelling and analysing human activity patterns or human mobility patterns. One of the essential tasks in such studies is to find the locations or places where individuals stay to perform some kind of activities before further activity pattern analysis. In the era of Big Data, the emerging of social media along with wearable devices enables human activity data to be collected more easily and efficiently. Furthermore, the dimension of the accessible human activity data has been extended from two to three (space or space-time) to four dimensions (space, time and semantics). More specifically, not only a location and time that people stay and spend are collected, but also what people “say” for in a location at a time can be obtained. The characteristics of these datasets shed new light on the analysis of human mobility, where some of new methodologies should be accordingly developed to handle them. Traditional methods such as neural networks, statistics and clustering have been applied to study human activity patterns using geosocial media data. Among them, clustering methods have been widely used to analyse spatiotemporal patterns. However, to our best knowledge, few of clustering algorithms are specifically developed for handling the datasets that contain spatial, temporal and semantic aspects all together. In this work, we propose a three-step human activity clustering method based on space, time and semantics to fill this gap. One-year Twitter data, posted in Toronto, Canada, is used to test the clustering-based method. The results show that the approximate 55% spatiotemporal clusters distributed in different locations can be eventually grouped as the same type of clusters with consideration of semantic aspect.},

This study examined the feasibility of using Google Glass, a head-mounted device that incorporates a webcam, viewing prism, and wireless connectivity, to assess the poisoned patient by a medical toxicology consult staff. Emergency medicine residents (resident toxicology consultants) rotating on the toxicology service wore Glass during bedside evaluation of poisoned patients; Glass transmitted real-time video of patients' physical examination findings to toxicology fellows and attendings (supervisory consultants), who reviewed these findings. We evaluated the usability (e.g., quality of connectivity and video feeds) of Glass by supervisory consultants, as well as attitudes towards use of Glass. Resident toxicology consultants and supervisory consultants completed 18 consults through Glass. Toxicologists viewing the video stream found the quality of audio and visual transmission usable in 89 % of cases. Toxicologists reported their management of the patient changed after viewing the patient through Glass in 56 % of cases. Based on findings obtained through Glass, toxicologists recommended specific antidotes in six cases. Head-mounted devices like Google Glass may be effective tools for real-time teletoxicology consultation.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to address a gap in operations management empirical research through the use of diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory to develop further insight into patient flow and bed management, a problem that has been taxing healthcare organizations across the world. Design/methodology/approach – The study used an action research (AR) approach and was conducted over an 18-month period within an acute hospital in the north east of England. Data were generated through enacting AR cycles, interviews, participant observation, document analysis, diaries, meetings, questionnaires and statistical analysis. Findings – The research conducted within this study has not only led to practical outcomes for the hospital in terms of the successful adoption of a new patient flow system but has also led to new knowledge about the determinants of diffusion for technological and process innovations in healthcare organizations which are complex and highly political. Research limitations/implications – AR is not suited to all organizations and is most appropriate within those that are culturally attuned to participative and democratic ways of working. The results from this study are not generalizable but some similar organizations may see merits in this approach. Social implications – The AR approach has supported the hospital in adopting the new system, PFMS. This system is helping to improve the quality of patient care, providing facilities to support the work of clinicians, aiding timely discharge of well patients back into the community and saving the hospital money in terms of not needing to open emergency “winter” wards. Originality/value – From an operations management perspective this work has demonstrated the potential to bring theory, in this case DOI theory, and practice closer together as well as show how academic research can impact organizations. Local-H intends to continue developing its AR approach and take it into other systems projects.},

abstract={While reliable detection of illicit drug use is paramount to the field of addiction, current methods involving self-report and urine drug screens have substantial limitations that hinder their utility. Wearable biosensors may fill a void by providing valuable objective data regarding the timing and contexts of drug use. This is a preliminary observational study of four emergency department patients receiving parenteral opioids and one individual using cocaine in a natural environment. A portable biosensor was placed on the inner wrist of each subject, to continuously measure electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and acceleration. Data were continuously recorded for at least 5 min prior to drug administration, during administration, and for at least 30 min afterward. Overall trends in biophysiometric parameters were assessed. Injection of opioids and cocaine use were associated with rises in EDA. Cocaine injection was also associated with a decrease in skin temperature. Opioid tolerance appeared to be associated with a blunted physiologic response as measured by the biosensor. Laterality may be an important factor, as magnitude of response varied between dominant and nondominant wrists in a single patient with bilateral wrist measurements. Changes in EDA and skin temperature are temporally associated with intravenous administration of opioids and cocaine; the intensity of response, however, may vary depending on history and extent of prior use.},

abstract={Abstract Objective The automated external defibrillator (AED) is a tool that contributes to survival with mixed outcomes. This review assesses the effectiveness of the AED, consistencies and variations among studies, and how varying outcomes can be resolved. Methods A worksheet for the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 2010 science review focused on hospital survival in AED programs was the foundation of the articles reviewed. Articles identified in the search covering a broader range of topics were added. All articles were read by at least two authors; consensus discussions resolved differences. Results AED use developed sequentially. Use of AEDs by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) compared to manual defibrillators showed equal or superior survival. AED use was extended to trained responders likely to be near victims, such as fire/rescue, police, airline attendants, and casino security guards, with improvement in all venues but not all programs. Broad public access initiatives demonstrated increased survival despite low rates of AED use. Home AED programs have not improved survival; in-hospital trials have had mixed results. Successful programs have placed devices in high-risk sites, maintained the AEDs, recruited a team with a duty to respond, and conducted ongoing assessment of the program. Conclusion The AED can affect survival among patients with sudden ventricular fibrillation (VF). Components of AED programs that affect outcome include the operator, location, the emergency response system, ongoing maintenance and evaluation. Comparing outcomes is complicated by variations in definitions of populations and variables. The effect of AEDs on individuals can be dramatic, but the effect on populations is limited.

abstract={A custom head-mounted display (HMD) integrated into a firefighter's facemask was evaluated for its ability to aid in navigating through large buildings in low-visibility conditions. The HMD was a monocular occluded design with a colour 640 × 480 pixel LCD mounted low in one's field of view. It showed the subject their real-time location on a floor plan. Subject location was found with an 802.15.4 wireless sensor network by using the received signal strength indicator localization method. The study consisted of two different courses of similar difficulty in different buildings in the campus of theUniversity of California, Berkeley. Therewere 21 subjects, of which eight of them were firefighters and five of them were female. The subjects completed the courses in the same order, but alternated in treatment condition. Subjects with the HMD returned on average a 38 per cent faster course completion time, a 44 per cent shorter distance travelled, 60 per cent fewer navigation errors, and 60 per cent more accurate map marking. A follow-up questionnaire showed a strong preference for use of the HMD in navigation tasks, and unanimous approval of the occluded optical design and low mounting location. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={So-called "wearable textile systems" are intended to improve the quality of life by enhancing the wearer's functionalities. Garments having the ability to monitor biosignals and communicate with the environment can, for example, provide continuous information about a person's state of health. These data can be valuable medical input, but also in emergency operations such as fire extinguishing, it can be a tool to decide on the operability of the fire fighter. However, wireless communication with the environment requires antennas. When preserving textile properties such as flexibility and comfort is an issue, antennas should be made fully integratable into garments and, thus, manufactured from textile material. This paper shows the feasibility of the use of textile materials in the design of antennas working in the dedicated 2.45 GHz frequency range. We used a commercial electromagnetic field simulator to design microstrip patch antennas fabricated from both conductive (electrotextiles) and nonconductive textile material. For the antenna and the ground plane, readily available electrotextiles were assessed: FlecTron ® , Shieldit (TM) Super and Zelt , while a fleece fabric was used for the antenna substrate. We found that such antenna prototypes had an efficiency of more than 75 %, which was comparable to conventional non-textile antennas. This research is an initial step in designing textile antennas and paves the way for a new generation of communicating garments.},

abstract={The paper presents a design methodology and a case study for monocular head-mounted displays (HMDs), wherein a user can simultaneously and easily see the physical world by looking through and/or around the display. The design approach is user-focused because of the complexity of the human visual system, and because HMDs are very task, user, and context specific. A literature review of factors related to HMD design is given. This includes considerations for basic optical design, the human visual system, and head and neck biomechanics. General HMD design guidelines are given based on these considerations. For the specific case study on fire-fighting, it is recommended that the HMD be mounted at 15° to 45° below the Frankfurt plane, with a 15° to 40° field of view. A resolution of 20-60 px/deg should be focused at 1 m or farther. The neck joint torque due to the HMD should not exceed about 1 Nm. This equates to a typical maximum weight of 0.5 to 1 kg depending on the mounting location. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In June 1980, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) recognized emergency medicine as a free-standing specialty requiring 4 years of residency training. (This was subsequently extended to 5 years.) Concurrently, the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) identified the need to upgrade emergency medicine education for family physicians (FPs) and created the administrative framework for a 1-year training program. As a result, emergency care in Canada today is provided by a heterogeneous group of clinicians. In urban centres, emergency departments are staffed by specialists who hold fellowships from the RCPSC (FRCPCs), FPs with certificates of special competence in emergency medicine from the CFPC (CCFP-EMs) and progressively fewer FPs and clinicians with a general licence.' The situation is different in smaller regional and rural hospitals, where the latter 2 groups provide virtually all emergency care. This diversity of emergency care providers reflects the varied educational, economic and geographic realities of our vast country, and it is further complicated by an overall shortage of Canadian emergency physicians.2-4 Moorehead and colleagues5 have calculated that, in the United States, physicians certified or trained in emergency medicine fill 58% of full-time-equivalent positions in acute care hospitals, and FPs and internists account for most of the rest. Adapting their formula to a Canadian setting, we can calculate that physicians certified in emergency medicine in this country fill about 45% of full-time-equivalent positions and that FPs fill the rest. In the United States, 124 emergency medicine training programs produce 1136 graduates each year.6 In Canada, at present, there are 27 training programs: 11 for FRCPCs and 16 for CCFP-EMs, with 20 and 70 postgraduate entry positions, respectively.7,8 Even with 2 educational tracks, the proportion of residency positions that are in emergency medicine is 21% lower in Canada than in the United States. Future urban emergency practice should become the domain of physicians certified in this speciality, whether FRCPCs or CCFP-EMs. Emergency departments in larger centres are the entry points for patients who present with increasingly more acute or complex medical, psychological or social problems. It is appropriate that practitioners with the most intensive training should carry out patient care, clinical teaching and research in those settings. FRCPCs will be able to draw upon their preparation for academic work and didactic teaching and by virtue of their training in family medicine, CCCFP-EMs will be able to apply their humanistic skills to patient care and clinical teaching.11 FPs will continue to be responsible for providing much of the emergency care in our rural settings. Although training in emergency skills for FPs is, overall, too short, we may expect that the further development of educational resources for emergency medicine in core family medicine programs will enhance the quality of emergency care in nonurban settings.},
