abstract={Telecare medical information system (TMIS) is a technology used in a wireless body area network (WBAN), which has a crucial role in healthcare services. TMIS uses wearable devices with sensors to collect patients’ data and transmit the data to the controller node via a public channel. Then, the medical server obtains the data from the controller node and stores it in the database to be analyzed. Unfortunately, an attacker can try to perform attacks via a public channel. Thus, establishing a secure mutual authentication protocol is essential for secure data transfer. Several authentication schemes have been presented to achieve mutual authentication, but there are performance limitations and security problems. Therefore, this study aimed to propose two secure and efficient WBAN authentication protocols between sensors and a mobile device/controller: authentication protocol-I for emergency medical reports and authentication protocol-II for periodic medical reports. To analyze the proposed authentication protocols, we conducted an informal security analysis, implemented BAN logic analysis, validated our proposed authentication protocol using the AVISPA simulation tool, and conducted a performance analysis. Consequently, we showed that our proposed protocols satisfy all security requirements in this study, attain mutual authentication, resist active and passive attacks, and have suitable computation and communication costs for a WBAN.},

abstract={Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is widely used in rehabilitation and athletic training to generate involuntary muscle contractions. However, EMS leads to rapid muscle fatigue, limiting the force a muscle can produce during prolonged use. Currently available methods to monitor localized muscle fatigue and recovery are generally not compatible with EMS. The purpose of this study was to examine whether Doppler ultrasound imaging can assess changes in stimulated muscle twitches that are related to muscle fatigue from electrical stimulation. We stimulated five isometric muscle twitches in the medial and lateral gastrocnemius of 13 healthy subjects before and after a fatiguing EMS protocol. Tissue Doppler imaging of the medial gastrocnemius recorded muscle tissue velocities during each twitch. Features of the average muscle tissue velocity waveforms changed immediately after the fatiguing stimulation protocol (peak velocity: -38%, p = .022; time-to-zero velocity: +8%, p = .050). As the fatigued muscle recovered, the features of the average tissue velocity waveforms showed a return towards their baseline values similar to that of the normalized ankle torque. We also found that features of the average tissue velocity waveform could significantly predict the ankle twitch torque for each participant (R2 = 0.255–0.849, p < .001). Our results provide evidence that Doppler ultrasound imaging can detect changes in muscle tissue during isometric muscle twitch that are related to muscle fatigue, fatigue recovery, and the generated joint torque. Tissue Doppler imaging may be a feasible method to monitor localized muscle fatigue during EMS in a wearable device.},

abstract={Firefighters need to gain information from both inside and outside of buildings in first response emergency scenarios. For this purpose, drones are beneficial. This paper presents an elicitation study that showed firefighters’ desires to collaborate with autonomous drones. We developed a Human–Drone interaction (HDI) method for indicating a target to a drone using 3D pointing gestures estimated solely from a monocular camera. The participant first points to a window without using any wearable or body-attached device. Through the drone’s front-facing camera, the drone detects the gesture and computes the target window. This work includes a description of the process for choosing the gesture, detecting and localizing objects, and carrying out the transformations between coordinate systems. Our proposed 3D pointing gesture interface improves on 2D interfaces by integrating depth information with SLAM and solving ambiguity with multiple objects aligned on the same plane in a large-scale outdoor environment. Experimental results showed that our 3D pointing gesture interface obtained average F1 scores of 0.85 and 0.73 for precision and recall in simulation and real-world experiments and an F1 score of 0.58 at the maximum distance of 25 m between the drone and building.},

abstract={The first responder training sector presents crucial difficulties on adopting “future of work” online training principles because physical (muscle) memory is considered as important as cognitive memory. It is obvious that physical memory cannot be obtained by existing screen- and paper-based trainings. This paper presents a novel training framework for first responders that leverages augmented reality and virtual reality technologies. The framework incorporates novel design thinking processes that are implemented for the design of the training experiences. In addition, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of various metrics such as performance, time on task, accuracy and learning rate are developed to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed framework. A special use case of the emergency medical services called the ambulance bus is investigated and it is shown that the proposed training methodology improved the accuracy of the first responders by a factor of 46% and the speed on executing tasks by 29%.},

abstract={The recent advances of Augmented Reality (AR) in healthcare have shown that technology is a significant part of the current healthcare system. In recent days, augmented reality has proposed numerous intelligent applications in the healthcare domain including, wearable access, telemedicine, remote surgery, diagnosis of medical reports, emergency medicine, etc. These developed augmented healthcare applications aim to improve patient care, increase efficiency, and decrease costs. Therefore, to identify the advances of AR-based healthcare applications, this article puts on an effort to perform an analysis of 45 peer-reviewed journal and conference articles from scholarly databases between 2011 and 2020. It also addresses concurrent concerns and their relevant future challenges including, user satisfaction, convenient prototypes, service availability, maintenance cost, etc. Despite the development of several AR healthcare applications, there are some untapped potentials regarding secure data trans-mission, which is an important factor for advancing this cutting-edge technology. Therefore, this paper also analyzes distinct AR security and privacy including, security requirements (i.e., scalability, confidentiality, integrity, resiliency, etc.) and attack terminologies (i.e. sniffing, fabrication, modification, interception, etc.). Based on the security issues, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence-based dynamic solution to build an intelligent security model to minimize data security risks. This intelligent model can identify seen and unseen threats in the threat detection layer and thus can protect data during data transmission. In addition, it prevents external attacks in the threat elimination layer using threat reduction mechanisms.},

abstract={Disasters, either manmade or natural, call for rapid and timely actions. Due to disaster, all of the communication infrastructures are destroyed, and there is no way for connection between people in disaster and others outside the disaster range. Drone technology is the critical technology for delivering communication services and guiding people and monitoring the unwanted effects of a disaster. The collaboration of advanced technologies can reduce life losses, save people’s lives, and manage the disaster crisis. The network performance of collaboration between the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone edge intelligence can help gather and process data, extend the wireless coverage area, deliver medical emergencies, provide real-time information about the emergency, and gather data from areas that are impossible for humans to reach. In this paper, we focus on the network performance for efficient collaboration of drone edge intelligence and smart wearable devices for disaster management. We focus mainly on network connectivity parameters for improving real-time data sharing between the drone edge intelligence and smart wearable devices. The relevant parameters that are considered in this study include delay, throughput, and the load from drone edge intelligence. It is further shown that network performance can have significant improvement when the abovementioned parameters are correctly optimised, and the improved performance can significantly improve the guiding/coordinating of search and rescue (SAR) teams effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={Matching sketch facial images to mug-shot images have crucial significance in law enforcement and digital entertainment. Conventional methods always assume that both the sketch and photo face images have the same resolutions. However, in real criminal detection, the target facial sketches obtained by the artist usually have different resolutions against the source photos in the mug-shot database. In this paper, we propose a locality-constrained feature space learning (LCFSL) method to address the above cross-resolution sketch-photo facial images matching problem. The proposed LCFSL approach not only build bridge to associate cross-domain face images, but also can learn resolution robust representation features for cross-resolution sketch-photo face recognition purpose. After common feature space learning, we simply use nearest neighbor classifier to perform recognition based on the projected features obtained from sketch-photo faces with different resolutions. Experiments conducted on CUHK student database and AR database have shown the effectiveness and superiority of our method to some state-of-the-art face recognition approaches.},

abstract={Recently, the healthcare technologies continue to develop rapidly, especially various wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices for body network have been invented one after another. The relevant products can already be easily purchased in the market such as the smart bracelet, smart blood pressure monitor and so on. These healthcare devices not only make users able to understand their own body information more in more detail but also provide a communication way to the hospital. It means that patients can obtain the professional medical prescription advice without going to the hospital in person because the health information can transmit to the medical cloud through any network interfaces. Additionally, both medical records of patients and prescription advice from doctors are stored in the cloud. In order to provide the better service quality, the use of fog in the network edge can quickly response the requests from the patients. The computing power of the fog node is less than the cloud. Therefore, balancing the trade-off between cloud and fog is very important. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem about offloading then use the metaheuristic to find out the best policy. Moreover, we also design an emergency supporting measure. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can provide a more efficient healthcare service.},

abstract={Global Burden of Disease Report, released in Sept 2017, shows that Cardio- vascular Diseases caused 1.7 million deaths (17.8%) in 2016 and it is the leading cause of deaths in India 1]. According to the Indian Heart Association, 25% of all heart attacks happen under the age of 40. In most cases, the initial heart attacks are often ignored. Even post-diagnosis, as per government data 2], 50% of heart attack cases reach the hospital in more than 400 minutes against the ideal window time of 180 minutes; post which damage is irreversible. The delay is often attributed to delay in reaching a hospital or receiving primary aid. In India, traffic conditions also add to the grimace of the situation. Although the government is taking various measures; a holistic solution is required to minimize the delay at each of the steps like accessing the patient situation, contacting the Medical aid or making available the nearest aid possible. In this paper, we aim at providing the holistic solution using the Internet of Things technology (IOT) along with data analytics. IoT enables real-time capturing and computation of medical data from smart sensors built-in wearable devices. The amalgamation of Internet-based services with Medical Things (Smart sensors) enhance the chances of survival of patients. The proposed system analyses the inputs collected from the sensors fit with the patients prone to cardiovascular diseases to ascertain the emergency situation. In addition, to these data, the system also considers age, maximum and minimum heart rate. Based on computational results received from the input parameters, the system triggers the alert to emergency contacts such as the close relatives of the patient, doctors, the hospitals and nearby ambulance. The proposed system combines with the optimized navigation platform to guide the medical assistance to find the fastest route.},

abstract={Researchers have identified lifestyle diseases as a major threat to human civilization. These diseases gradually progress without giving any warning and result in a sudden health aggravation that leads to a medical emergency. As such, individuals can only avoid the life-threatening condition if they regularly monitor their health status. Health recommendation systems allow users to continuously monitor their health and deliver proper health advice to them. Also, continuous health monitoring depends on the real-time data exchange between health solution providers and users. In this regard, healthcare providers have begun to use wearable devices and recommendation systems to collect data in real time and to manage health conditions based on the generated data. However, we lack literature that has examined how individuals use wearable devices, what type of data the devices collect, and how providers use the data for delivering solutions to users. Thus, we decided to explore the available literature in this domain to understand how wearable devices can provide solutions to consumers. We also extended our focus to cover current health service delivery frameworks with the help of recommender systems. Thus, this study reviews health-monitoring services by conglomerating both wearable device and recommendation system to come up with personalized health and fitness solutions. Additionally, the paper elucidates key components of an advanced-level real-time monitoring service framework to guide future research and practice in this domain.},

abstract={Time constraints is the most critical factor that faces the first responders’ teams for search and rescue operations during the aftermath of natural disasters and hazardous areas. The utilization of robotic solutions to speed up search missions would help save the lives of humans who are in need of help as quickly as possible. With such a human-robot collaboration, by using autonomous robotic solutions, the first response team will be able to locate the causalities and possible victims in order to be able to drop emergency kits at their locations. This paper presents a design of vision-based neural network controller for the autonomous landing of a quadrotor on fixed and moving targets for Maritime Search and Rescue applications. The proposed controller does not require prior information about the target location and depends entirely on the vision system to estimate the target positions. Simulations of the proposed controller are presented using ROS Gazebo environment and are validated experimentally in the laboratory using a Parrot AR Drone system. The simulation and experimental results show the successful control of the quadrotor in autonomously landing on both fixed and moving landing platforms.},

abstract={With the growing increase of disasters worldwide, in terms of frequencies, intensities and unpredictability, there is currently a growing need for novel ubiquitous communication systems enabling public safety networks (PSN). Disaster operations require real-time and low latency data communication, in live video and audio streaming, as well as in integration with social networks. In this context, existing network infrastructures might be either damaged or overloaded. Thus, it is expected that wireless Body-to-Body Networks (B2Bs) could play a key role in setting-up tactical PSN deployments enabling effective and reliable disaster response and management. In addition to the challenges with radio technologies and their inter-operability, coexistence and energy consumption issues, routing is also an important and critical challenge for the PSN. In this paper we propose a novel wireless B2B routing protocol, called "Optimized Routing Approach for Critical and Emergency Networks (ORACE-Net)" to enhance routing performance in disaster relief. ORACE-Net aims to exploit dynamic B2B communications between wearable networks to establish and maintain a mobile dynamic communication backbone. Analytical evaluations are conducted to analyze the communication overheads of ORACE-Net in comparison to existing routing standards, including Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector version 2 (AODVv2), Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) and Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR). Extensive simulations are then performed under realistic assumptions and synthetic mobility models, and show that ORACE-Net outperforms conventional routing approaches in terms of packet reception rate, energy consumption and fairly performed in terms of delay compared to the other approaches.},

abstract={In the domain of emergency management, in addition to the constant technical skill-upgrade required by the nature of the humanitarian context, the importance of an appropriate training is widely recognized. In particular, giving responders information technology skills so that they are well prepared to address health, security and managerial concerns represents a key factor by which the goal of an efficient and effective humanitarian emergency response can be pursued. In this paper we propose the adoption of augmented reality mobile interfaces to enhance the training efficacy for on-site crisis preparedness activities. The system we propose originated from the idea to allow trainees to exploit Augmented Reality (AR) interaction and become quickly familiar with the mobile technology adopted today in emergency response activities.},

abstract={The communication infrastructure among various interconnected devices has revolutionized the process of collecting and sharing information. This evolutionary paradigm of collecting, storing and analyzing data streams is called the Internet of Everything (IoE). The information exchange through IoE is fast and accurate but leaves security issues. The emergence of IoE has seen a drift from a single novel technology to several technological developments. Managing various technologies under one infrastructure is complex especially when a network is openly allowing nodes to access it. Access transition of infrastructures from closed networked environments to the public internets has raised security issues. The consistent growth in IoE technology is recognized as a bridge between physical, virtual and cross-cultural worlds. Modern enterprises are becoming reliant on interconnected wireless intelligent devices and this has put billions of user’s data in risk. The interference and intrusion in any infrastructure have opened the door of public safety concerns because this interception could compromise the user’s personal data as well as personal privacy. This research aims to adopt a holistic approach to devising a secure IoE architecture for cross-culture communication organizations, with attention paid to the various technological wearable devices, their security policies, communication protocols, data format and data encryption features to avoid the data exploitation. A systems methodology will be adopted with a view to developing a secure IoE model which provides for a generic implementation after analyzing the critical security features to minimize the risk of data exploitations. This would combine the ability of IoE to connect, communicate, and remotely manage an incalculable number of networked, automated devices with the security properties of authentication, availability, integrity and confidentiality on a configurable basis. This will help clarify issues currently present and narrow down security threats planning considerably.},

abstract={Issue Title: Advances in Mobile Networking: Wearable Systems and Novel Management Solutions This paper presents a scalable prototype surveillance/alarm system for public transportation safety applications over railway environments with emphasis given in the wireless vehicular communication inside a tunnel after an emergency event. An heterogeneous hybrid vehicular wireless network consisted of IEEE 802.11b/g/e and IEEE 802.16e is being deployed inside a tunnel environment for surveillance reasons. We provide a highly modular architecture system design covering a wide range of applications both in terms of monitored spaces (metro stations, trains, buses and other public transport) and in terms of threats to public safety (security incidents, accidental events, natural hazards) based on autonomous, smart monitoring devices that capture data only upon the occurrence of an incident, potentially dangerous for the passengers (like an explosion blast or the triggering of the fire detector). Moreover, we evaluate the experimental performance of the proposed vehicular hybrid WiMAX/WLAN wireless network after an emergency situation, for this reason we emulate the train coaches movement with vehicles inside a tunnel field. Finally, we also survey on the impact of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) over the hybrid wireless network comparing the experimental results.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue on Personal Projection The support of realistic and flexible training simulations for military, law enforcement, emergency response, and other domains has been an important motivator for the development of augmented reality technology. An important vision for achieving this goal has been the creation of a versatile "stage" for physical, emotional, and cognitive training that combines virtual characters and environments with real world elements, such as furniture and props. This paper presents REFLCT, a mixed reality projection framework that couples a near-axis personal projector design with tracking and novel retroreflective props and surfaces. REFLCT provides multiple users with personalized, perspective-correct imagery that is uniquely composited for each user directly into and onto a surrounding environment, without any optics positioned in front of the user's eyes or face. These characteristics facilitate team training experiences which allow users to easily interact with their teammates while wearing their standard issue gear. REFLCT can present virtual humans who can make deictic gestures and establish eye contact without the geometric ambiguity of a typical projection display. It can also display perspective-correct scenes that require a realistic approach for detecting and communicating potential threats between multiple users in disparate locations. In addition to training applications, this display system appears to be well matched with other user interface and application domains, such as asymmetric collaborative workspaces and personal information guides.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This paper describes a wearable mobihealth care system aiming at providing long-term continuous monitoring of vital signs for high-risk cardiovascular patients. We use a portable patient unit (PPU) and a wearable shirt (WS) to monitor electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration (acquired with respiratory inductive plethysmography, RIP), and activity. Owing to integrating fabric sensors and electrodes endowed with electro-physical properties into the WS, long-term continuous monitoring can be realized without making patients feel uncomfortable and restricting their mobility. The PPU analyzes physiological signals in real time and determines whether the patient is in danger or needs external help. The PPU will alert the patient and an emergency call will be automatically established with a medical service center (MSC) when life-threatening arrhythmias or falls are detected. With advanced gpsOne technology, the patient can be located and rescued immediately whether he/she is indoors or outdoors in case of emergency.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Current applications of wearable computers are reviewed and categorized according to dimensions of "time" and "reference." The time dimension is based on whether the system uses information that is stored, information that is current or information that can help in predicting future events. The reference dimension is concerned with the type of application, the event, task, environment, person or artifact. Each of these categories can be described in terms of its temporal features. It is proposed that these dimensions distinguish wearable computers from their desk-downed counterparts, and this raises the question of appropriate. Paradigms for wearable computers. A user-centered methodology is then presented and illustrated by paramedic and fire-fighter applications.},
