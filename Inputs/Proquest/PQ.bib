abstract={Lethal prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by the presence of metastases and development of resistance to therapies. Metastases form in a multi-step process enabled by dynamic cytoskeleton remodeling. An actin cytoskeleton regulating gene, CALD1, encodes a protein caldesmon (CaD). Its isoform, low-molecular-weight CaD (l-CaD), operates in non-muscle cells, supporting the function of filaments involved in force production and mechanosensing. Several factors, including glucocorticoid receptor (GR), have been identified as regulators of l-CaD in different cell types, but the regulation of l-CaD in PCa has not been defined. PCa develops resistance in response to therapeutic inhibition of androgen signaling by multiple strategies. Known strategies include androgen receptor (AR) alterations, modified steroid synthesis, and bypassing AR signaling, for example, by GR upregulation. Here, we report that in vitro downregulation of l-CaD promotes epithelial phenotype and reduces spheroid growth in 3D, which is reflected in vivo in reduced formation of metastases in zebrafish PCa xenografts. In accordance, CALD1 mRNA expression correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcripts in PCa patients. We also show that CALD1 is highly co-expressed with GR in multiple PCa data sets, and GR activation upregulates l-CaD in vitro. Moreover, GR upregulation associates with increased l-CaD expression after the development of resistance to antiandrogen therapy in PCa xenograft mouse models. In summary, GR-regulated l-CaD plays a role in forming PCa metastases, being clinically relevant when antiandrogen resistance is attained by the means of bypassing AR signaling by GR upregulation.},

abstract={Optical anisotropy of α-MoO3 in its reststrahlen (RS) bands provides exciting opportunities for constructing the polarization-dependent devices. However, achieving broadband anisotropic absorptions through the same α-MoO3 arrays is still challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that selective broadband absorption can be achieved by using the same α-MoO3 square pyramid arrays (SPAs). For both the x and y polarizations, the absorption responses of the α-MoO3 SPAs calculated by using the effective medium theory (EMT) agreed well with those of the FDTD, indicating the excellent selective broadband absorption of the α-MoO3 SPAs are associated with the resonant hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) modes assisted by the anisotropic gradient antireflection (AR) effect of the structure. The near-field distribution of the absorption wavelengths of the α-MoO3 SPAs shows that the magnetic-field enhancement of the lager absorption wavelength tends to shift to the bottom of the α-MoO3 SPAs due to the lateral Fabry–Pérot (F–P) resonance, and the electric-field distribution exhibits the ray-like light propagation trails due to the resonance nature of the HPhPs modes. In addition, broadband absorption of the α-MoO3 SPAs can be maintained if the width of the bottom edge of the α-MoO3 pyramid is large than 0.8 μm, and excellent anisotropic absorption performances are almost immune to the variations of the thickness of the spacer and the height of the α-MoO3 pyramid.},

abstract={BackgroundMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive form of cancer unresponsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) that spreads quickly to other organs. Despite reduced androgen levels after ADT, mCRPC development and lethality continues to be conducted by the androgen receptor (AR) axis. The maintenance of AR signaling in mCRPC is a result of AR alterations, androgen intratumoral production, and the action of regulatory elements, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). ncRNAs are key elements in cancer signaling, acting in tumor growth, metabolic reprogramming, and tumor progression. In prostate cancer (PCa), the ncRNAs have been reported to be associated with AR expression, PCa proliferation, and castration resistance. In this study, we aimed to reconstruct the lncRNA-centered regulatory network of mCRPC and identify the lncRNAs which act as master regulators (MRs).MethodsWe used publicly available RNA-sequencing to infer the regulatory network of lncRNAs in mCRPC. Five gene signatures were employed to conduct the master regulator analysis. Inferred MRs were then subjected to functional enrichment and symbolic regression modeling. The latter approach was applied to identify the lncRNAs with greater predictive capacity and potential as a biomarker in mCRPC.ResultsWe identified 31 lncRNAs involved in cellular proliferation, tumor metabolism, and invasion-metastasis cascade. SNHG18 and HELLPAR were the highlights of our results. SNHG18 was downregulated in mCRPC and enriched to metastasis signatures. It accurately distinguished both mCRPC and primary CRPC from normal tissue and was associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell-matrix adhesion pathways. HELLPAR consistently distinguished mCRPC from primary CRPC and normal tissue using only its expression.ConclusionOur results contribute to understanding the regulatory behavior of lncRNAs in mCRPC and indicate SNHG18 and HELLPAR as master regulators and potential new diagnostic targets in this tumor.},

abstract={COVID-19 has impacted the healthcare system across the globe. The study will span three pandemic waves in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The goal is to learn how the pandemic affects antenatal care (ANC) and emergency delivery care for pregnant women in Tamil Nadu, India, and how medical services respond. The study employs counterfactual analysis to evaluate the causal impact of the pandemic. A feedforward in combination with a simple auto-regressive neural network (AR-Net) is used to predict the daily number of calls for ambulance services (CAS). Three categories of the daily CAS count between January 2016 and December 2022 are utilised. The total CAS includes all types of medical emergencies; the second group pertains to planned ANC for high-risk pregnant women and the third group comprises CAS from pregnant women for medical emergencies. The second wave’s infection and mortality rates were up to six times higher than the first. The phases in wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III experienced a significant increase in both total IFT (inter-facility transfer) and total non-IFT calls covering all emergencies relative to the counterfactual, as evidenced by reported effect sizes of 1 and a range of 0.65 to 0.85, respectively. This highlights overwhelmed health services. In Tamil Nadu, neither emergency prenatal care nor planned prenatal care was affected by the pandemic. In contrast, the increase in actual emergency-related IFT calls during wave-II, post-wave-II, wave-III, and post-wave-III was 62%, 160%, 141%, and 165%, respectively, relative to the counterfactual. During the same time periods, the mean daily CAS related to prenatal care increased by 47%, 51%, 38%, and 38%, respectively, compared to pre-pandemic levels. The expansion of ambulance services and increased awareness of these services during wave II and the ensuing phases of Covid-19 pandemic have enhanced emergency care delivery for all, including obstetric and neonatal cohorts.},

abstract={The molecular determinants of the heterogenic course of prostate cancer (PC) remain elusive. We aimed to determine the drivers predisposing to unfavorable PC outcomes anticipated by BCR events among patients of similar preoperative characteristics. The TCGA transcriptomic and clinical data of 497 PC individuals were used, stratified according to the risk of BCR by EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-SIOG. The relevance of the functional markers regarding BCR-free survival was examined by the cutp algorithm. Through UpSetR, subgroups of PC patients bearing an unfavorable signature were identified, followed by the hierarchical clustering of the major markers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). BCR-free survival was estimated with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. ESR1 significantly differentiated BCR-free survival, whereas AR did not. An elevation in KLK3 correlated with better prognosis, although PGR, KLK3, CDH1, and MMP3 predicted BCR better than the preoperative PSA level. Patients sharing an unfavorable profile of ESR1 and MMP3 together with lymph node status, Gleason score, T, and EAU risk groups were at a higher risk of BCR originating from mesenchymal features of PC cells. To conclude, we revealed an ESR1-driven unfavorable profile of EMT underpinning a worse PC trajectory. ESR1 may have a major role in PC progression; therefore, it could become a major focus for further investigations.},

abstract={Introduction/Background Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) and disasters require an organised and effective response from medical first responders (MFRs). As such, novel training methods have emerged to prepare and adequately train MFRs for these challenging situations. Particular focus should be placed on extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR, AR, and MR, respectively), and allows participants to develop high-quality skills in realistic and immersive environments. Given the rapid evolution of high-fidelity simulation technology and its advantages, XR simulation has become a promising tool for emergency medicine. Accordingly, this systematic review aims to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of XR training methods and 2) explore the experience of MFRs undergoing such training. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will encompass four distinct themes: MFRs, disasters/MCIs, education and simulation, and XR. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACs) will be searched along with an in-depth examination of the grey literature and reference lists of relevant articles. MetaQAT will be used as a study quality assessment tool and integrated into Covidence as part of the data extraction form. Given the predicted high heterogeneity between studies, it may not be possible to standardise data for quantitative comparison and meta-analysis. Thus, data will be synthesised in a narrative, semi-quantitative manner. Discussion This review will examine the existing literature on the effectiveness of XR simulation as a tool to train MFRs for MCIs, which could ultimately improve preparedness and response to disasters.

abstract={Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) plays an important role in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It is necessary to establish a genetic signature associated with AKR1C3 that can be used to predict the prognosis of PCa patients and provide important information for clinical treatment decisions. AKR1C3-related genes were identified via label-free quantitative proteomics of the AKR1C3-overexpressing LNCaP cell line. A risk model was constructed through the analysis of clinical data, PPI, and Cox-selected risk genes. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan–Meier (K–M) curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to verify the accuracy of the model, and two external datasets were used to verify the reliability of the results. Subsequently, the tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivity were explored. Moreover, the roles of AKR1C3 in the progression of PCa were verified in LNCaP cells. MTT, colony formation, and EdU assays were conducted to explore cell proliferation and drug sensitivity to enzalutamide. Migration and invasion abilities were measured using wound-healing and transwell assays, and qPCR was used to assess the expression levels of AR target genes and EMT genes. CDC20, SRSF3, UQCRH, INCENP, TIMM10, TIMM13, POLR2L, and NDUFAB1 were identified as AKR1C3-associated risk genes. These risk genes, established using the prognostic model, can effectively predict the recurrence status, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity of PCa. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and several immune checkpoints that promote cancer progression were higher in high-risk groups. Furthermore, there was a close correlation between the sensitivity of PCa patients to bicalutamide and docetaxel and the expression levels of the eight risk genes. Moreover, through in vitro experiments, Western blotting confirmed that AKR1C3 enhanced SRSF3, CDC20, and INCENP expression. We found that PCa cells with a high expression of AKR1C3 have high proliferation ability and high migration ability and were insensitive to enzalutamide. AKR1C3-associated genes had a significant role in the process of PCa, immune responses, and drug sensitivity and offer the potential for a novel model for prognostic prediction in PCa.},

abstract={As mass casualty incidents continue to escalate in the United States, we must improve frontline responder performance to increase the odds of victim survival. In this article, we describe the First Responder Virtual Reality Simulator, a high-fidelity, fully immersive, automated, programmable virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to train frontline responders to treat and triage victims of mass casualty incidents. First responder trainees don a wireless VR head-mounted display linked to a compatible desktop computer. Trainees see and hear autonomous, interactive victims who are programmed to simulate individuals with injuries consistent with an explosion in an underground space. Armed with a virtual medical kit, responders are tasked with triaging and treating the victims on the scene. The VR environment can be made more challenging by increasing the environmental chaos, adding patients, or increasing the acuity of patient injuries. The VR platform tracks and records their performance as they navigate the disaster scene. Output from the system provides feedback to participants on their performance. Eventually, we hope that the First Responder system will serve both as an effective replacement for expensive conventional training methods as well as a safe and efficient platform for research on current triage protocols.},

abstract={Illicit drug misuse has become a widespread issue that requires continuous drug monitoring and diagnosis. Wearable electrochemical drug detection devices possess the potential to function as potent screening instruments in the possession of law enforcement personnel, aiding in the fight against drug trafficking and facilitating forensic investigations conducted on site. These wearable sensors are promising alternatives to traditional detection methods. In this study, we present a novel wearable electrochemical glove-based analytical device (eGAD) designed especially for detecting the club drug, methamphetamine. To develop this sensor, we immobilized meth aptamer onto silver nanoparticle (AgNPs)-modified electrodes that were printed onto latex gloves. The characteristics of AgNPs, including their shape, size and purity were analysed using FTIR, SEM and UV vis spectrometry, confirming the successful synthesis. The developed sensor shows a 0.1 µg/mL limit of detection and 0.3 µg/mL limit of quantification with a linear concentration range of about 0.01–5 µg/mL and recovery percentages of approximately 102 and 103%, respectively. To demonstrate its applicability, we tested the developed wearable sensor by spiking various alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink samples. We found that the sensor remains effective for 60 days, making it a practical option with a reasonable shelf-life. The developed sensor offers several advantages, including its affordability, ease of handling and high sensitivity and selectivity. Its portable nature makes it an ideal tool for rapid detection of METH in beverages too.},

abstract={Prostate cancer is the predominant cause of cancer in men, but there is still a lack of biomarkers and treatments for metastatic spread. The initial promise of microRNAs to provide avenues to solve these problems has been dampened by the realisation that microRNAs co-exist in multiple functionally distinct isoforms, for example due to A-to-I editing. We recently found that A-to-I-editing of microRNA-379 (miR-379) was associated with prostate cancer, and that only the unedited isoform was negatively correlated with aggressive disease. Here, we set out to decipher the biological effects of unedited and edited miR-379 in prostate cancer cells. After transfection of four different prostate cancer cell lines with isoform-specific miR-379 mimics, we performed assays for cell growth, colony formation, migration, cell–cell adhesion, and analysed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness markers. We found that unedited miR-379 affected cell growth, with a promoting function in androgen receptor (AR)-negative cells and an inhibiting effect in AR-positive cells. This is supported by our in silico analysis that found unedited miR-379 targets are predicted to be predominantly involved in cellular proliferation whereas the targets of edited miR-379 are not. We further found that both miR-379 isoforms could promote colony formation, migration, and cell–cell adhesion. Overall, our data suggests that editing of miR-379 attenuates the growth-suppressive function of unedited miR-379 in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, thereby promoting tumor growth.},

abstract={BackgroundProstate cancer(PCa) is the most commonly occurring male cancer in the USA. Abiraterone or Enzalutamide have been approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the treatment-emergent neuroendocrine PCa (t-NEPC) may develop, resulting in drug resistance in about 10–17% CRPC patients. The detailed mechanisms remain unclear..MethodsThe expression correlation of TOMM20 and AR in PCa was determined by analyzing publicly available datasets, or by IHC staining in tumor specimens. The protein interaction of TOMM20 and AR was validated by co-immunoprecipitation or GST pull-down assay. The impact of TOMM20 depletion on drug sensitivity were elucidated by assays of cell proliferation, invasion, sphere formation, xenograft growth and intravenous metastasis. The intracellular ROS level was measured by flow cytometry, and the NEPC transdifferentiation and characteristics of cancer stem-like cells were validated by RNA-seq, RT-PCR and western blotting.ResultsThe protein level of TOMM20 is positively correlated with AR in PCa cells and specimens. TOMM20 protein physically interacts with AR. AR antagonists induced the protein degradation of TOMM20 through autophagy-lysosomal pathway, thereby elevating the intracellular ROS level and activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. When TOMM20 was depleted, PCa cells underwent EMT, acquired the characteristics of cancer stem-like cells, and developed resistance to AR antagonists. The stable depletion of TOMM20 promoted the transdifferentiation of PCa adenocarcinoma into NEPC and metastasis. Conversely, the rescue of TOMM20 re-sensitized the resistant PCa cells to AR antagonists.ConclusionsTOMM20 protein degradation induced by AR antagonists promoted the transdifferentiation of PCa to NEPC, thereby revealing a novel molecular mechanism by which AR antagonists develop drug resistance through mitochondrial outer membrane-mediated signaling pathway. These findings suggested that the decreasing or loss of TOMM20 expression in PCa tissues might become a useful predictor of PCa resistance to AR antagonists.},

abstract={BackgroundProstate cancer is a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in men worldwide. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has proven effective in early-stage androgen-sensitive disease, but prostate cancer gradually develops into an androgen-resistant metastatic state in the vast majority of patients. According to our oncogene-induced model for cancer development, senescence is a major tumor progression barrier. However, whether senescence is implicated in the progression of early-stage androgen-sensitive to highly aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains poorly addressed.MethodsAndrogen-dependent (LNCaP) and –independent (C4-2B and PC-3) cells were treated or not with enzalutamide, an Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitor. RNA sequencing and pathway analyses were carried out in LNCaP cells to identify potential senescence regulators upon treatment. Assessment of the invasive potential of cells and senescence status following enzalutamide treatment and/or RNAi-mediated silencing of selected targets was performed in all cell lines, complemented by bioinformatics analyses on a wide range of in vitro and in vivo datasets. Key observations were validated in LNCaP and C4-2B mouse xenografts. Senescence induction was assessed by state-of-the-art GL13 staining by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy.ResultsWe demonstrate that enzalutamide treatment induces senescence in androgen-sensitive cells via reduction of the replication licensing factor CDC6. Mechanistically, we show that CDC6 downregulation is mediated through endogenous activation of the GATA2 transcription factor functioning as a CDC6 repressor. Intriguingly, GATA2 levels decrease in enzalutamide-resistant cells, leading to CDC6 stabilization accompanied by activation of Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers and absence of senescence. We show that CDC6 loss is sufficient to reverse oncogenic features and induce senescence regardless of treatment responsiveness, thereby identifying CDC6 as a critical determinant of prostate cancer progression.ConclusionsWe identify a key GATA2-CDC6 signaling axis which is reciprocally regulated in enzalutamide-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer environments. Upon acquired resistance, GATA2 repression leads to CDC6 stabilization, with detrimental effects in disease progression through exacerbation of EMT and abrogation of senescence. However, bypassing the GATA2-CDC6 axis by direct inhibition of CDC6 reverses oncogenic features and establishes senescence, thereby offering a therapeutic window even after acquiring resistance to therapy.},

abstract={Simple SummaryIn addition to millions of normal red and white blood cells, the blood of cancer patients contains a variety of very rare cell types associated with the tumor. A simple blood draw or ‘liquid biopsy’ can, thus, provide important information about the state of the disease no matter where it exists in the body. In this paper, we describe a method for imaging all rare cells in a blood draw and the means to define each cell type using a combination of genomic, proteomic, and morphological measurements to distinguish tumor cells from mesenchymal and endothelial cells that are present in the tumor microenvironment. We compare the results of this assay among multiple prostate and breast cancer patients and show that this cellular profiling method is valid across patients and cancer types and may provide important biomarkers for assessing disease in real time.AbstractBi-directional crosstalk between the tumor and the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been shown to increase the rate of tumor evolution and to play a key role in neoplastic progression, therapeutic resistance, and a patient’s overall survival. Here, we set out to use a comprehensive liquid-biopsy analysis to study cancer and specific TME cells in circulation and their association with disease status. Cytokeratin+, CD45- circulating rare cells (CRCs) from nine breast and four prostate cancer patients were characterized through morphometrics, single-cell copy number analysis, and targeted multiplexed proteomics to delineate cancer cell lineage from other rare cells originating in the TME. We show that we can detect epithelial circulating tumor cells (EPI.CTC), CTCs undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT.CTC) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) using a universal rare event detection platform (HDSCA). Longitudinal analysis of an index patient finds that CTCs are present at the time of disease progression, while CECs are predominately present at the time of stable disease. In a small cohort of prostate and breast cancer patients, we find high inter-patient and temporal intra-patient variability in the expression of tissue specific markers such as ER, HER2, AR, PSA and PSMA and EpCAM. Our study stresses the importance of the multi-omic characterization of circulating rare cells in patients with breast and prostate carcinomas, specifically highlighting overlapping and cell type defining proteo-genomic characteristics of CTCs and CECs.},

abstract={The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in many cell types, and its related signaling is widely investigated in hormone-dependent cancers such as prostate and breast. The significance of the AR, however, has been detected even in other cancers, including gastric, bladder, kidney, lung, hepatic, and pancreatic, in which growth and spreading are not strictly or notoriously dependent on sex steroid hormone action. The incidence and mortality of these cancers are, however, somewhat related to gender and, specifically, are higher in men than in women, with the ratio reaching 3–4:1 for bladder cancer. This direct correlation between cancer incidence, mortality, and gender makes sex one of the most important risk factors for these cancers and has incited investigation about the role of sex steroid receptors and their activating hormones in gender-related cancers. In these cancers, the AR is often expressed and seems to play a pivotal role in different processes contributing to cancer onset and progression such as growth, spreading, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This manuscript will offer an overview of the role of the AR in many cancers of the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems wherein its role has been at least partially analyzed. Understanding the role of the AR in these tumors could help us to identify a new biomarker for early diagnostic guidance and to develop better therapeutic approaches by directly targeting the AR or its downstream signaling in individual cells of hormone-related cancers at different stages.},

abstract={Featured ApplicationThe paper displays the analysis of lichen colonization of rocky fault-scarps to perform geochronological analyses and evidence ancient to historical earthquakes. This applied research shows the high sensitivity of vertical/horizontal position, geographical orientation and lithological nature of lichen colonized rock surfaces for the obtention of reliable lichen growth rates (LGR) applicable to geochronology.AbstractThe Sencelles Fault constitutes the main extensional structure of Mallorca Island (Spain), holds a NE-SE orientation, and has been identified as the possible seismic source of the 1851 CE Palma earthquake (VII EMS.) The SE termination of the fault (Sta. Eugenia Segment) features a linear bedrock fault scarp of a maximum of 3.15 m height. The last 840 m of this rocky scarp display a significant horizontal banding, with up to five differentially weathered ribbons colonized by lichens. The lichenometric analysis is based on the measurement of 155 specimens of Aspicilia calcarea (Ac) and Aspicilia radiosa (Ar) in tombstones and funerary monuments (with inscribed dates) from the nearby cemeteries of Sta. María del Camí, Sta. Eugenia and Sencelles, to obtain the local lichen growth rates (LGR), with the two last graveyards being directly located in the fault zone. Lichens were measured on variously oriented (N, S, NE, SW, etc…) horizontal and vertical surfaces, generating differentially oriented lichen populations (DOLPs) to be compared with the Ac and Ar specimens colonizing the studied fault scarp (38 measured individual specimens). After successive trial and error regression tests, vertical DOLPs resulted in the best appropriate groups for the analysis, with LGR of 0.23–0.31 mm/yr. Horizontal ones reached widths of up to 20 cm, with LGR up to 0.84 mm/yr, which were clearly oversized. The application of the selected LGR points to a human-induced origin for the thin basal lichen ribbon of the scarp (10–13 cm), which should have developed during the middle 20th century (c. 1950–1966) because of documented ground leveling works. However, the second ribbon of the scarp (23–47 cm) shows exposure dates of 1852 ± 40 (Ar) and 1841 ± 59 (Ac), overlapping the date of the 1851 CE earthquake. The study is complemented with data from a fault trench excavated in the year 2002 at the toe of the scarp. The combined data of lichenometry, fault trenching, and the length of the analyzed fault scarp (c. 840 m) indicate that the studied segment of the fault cannot be considered a co-seismic surface faulting related to the 1851 CE event as a whole, but a relevant secondary earthquake effect on a pre-existing fault scarp (e.g., sympathetic ground ruptures).},

abstract={In plant and animal breeding, sometimes observations are not independently distributed. There may exist a correlated relationship between the observations. In the presence of highly correlated observations, the classical premise of independence between observations is violated. Plant and animal breeders are particularly interested to study the genetic components for different important traits. In general, for estimating heritability, a random component in the model must adhere to specific assumptions, such as random components, including errors, having a normal distribution, and being identically independently distributed. However, in many real-world situations, all of the assumptions are not fulfilled. In this study, correlated error structures are considered errors that are associated to estimate heritability for the full-sib model. The number of immediately preceding observations in an autoregressive series that are used to predict the value at the current observation is defined as the order of the autoregressive models. First-order and second-order autoregressive models i.e., AR(1) and AR(2) error structures, have been considered. In the case of the full-sib model, theoretical derivation of Expected Mean sum square (EMS) considering AR(1) structure has been obtained. A numerical explanation is provided for the derived EMS considering AR(1) structure. The predicted mean squares error (MSE) is obtained after including the AR(1) error structures in the model, and heritability is estimated using the resulting equations. It is noticed that correlated errors have a major influence on heritability estimation. Different correlation patterns, such as AR(1) and AR(2), can be inferred to change heritability estimates and MSE values. To attain better results, several combinations are offered for various scenarios.},

abstract={BackgroundBarth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth abnormalities and often leads to death in childhood. Recently, elamipretide has been tested as a potential first disease-modifying drug. This study aimed to identify patients with BTHS who may respond to elamipretide, based on continuous physiological measurements acquired through wearable devices.ResultsData from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 12 patients with BTHS were used, including physiological time series data measured using a wearable device (heart rate, respiratory rate, activity, and posture) and functional scores. The latter included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue score, SWAY Balance Mobile Application score (SWAY balance score), BTHS Symptom Assessment (BTHS-SA) Total Fatigue score, muscle strength by handheld dynamometry, 5 times sit-and-stand test (5XSST), and monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin ratio (MLCL:CL). Groups were created through median split of the functional scores into “highest score” and “lowest score”, and “best response to elamipretide” and “worst response to elamipretide”. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) models were implemented to assess whether physiological data could classify patients according to functional status and distinguish non-responders from responders to elamipretide. AHC models clustered patients according to their functional status with accuracies of 60–93%, with the greatest accuracies for 6MWT (93%), PROMIS (87%), and SWAY balance score (80%). Another set of AHC models clustered patients with respect to their response to treatment with elamipretide with perfect accuracy (all 100%).ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that continuously acquired physiological measurements from wearable devices can be used to predict functional status and response to treatment among patients with BTHS.},

abstract={The 2022 Winter Olympics were held in the three competition zones of Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, China. The venues of this Winter Olympics were scattered and the terrain was complex. Moreover, the medical resources of Hebei and Beijing were relatively unbalanced. In the medical security of major events, the connection between first aid and in-hospital processes is of the utmost importance to rescue quality. 5th generation mobile network (5G) applications in medical scenarios are on the rise. It would be of great relevance to fully use 5G’s low-latency and high-speed features to share the process information of patients, ambulance personnel, and the destination hospital’s rescue team at emergency scenes and in transportation, improving rescue efficiency. This paper proposes a system scheme of cross-institutional emergency health information sharing based on 5G and augmented reality wearable devices. It also integrates the construction method of monitoring and other sign data sharing, in addition to testing the proposed scheme’s service quality in 5G environments. In the deployment area of the 5G emergency medical rescue information sharing scheme for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, we selected two designated medical support institutions for testing. The test adopted a combination of fixed-point and driving tests to experiment on the service data, voice service, and streaming media indicators. The 5G signal's coverage rate was close to 100%, the standalone connection's success rate was 100%, and the drop rate was 0. The average downlink rate of multiple scenarios was 620mbps, and the average uplink rate of 5G was over 71.8mbps, which is higher than the average 5G level in China. The downlink rate was more than 20 times larger than the 4th generation mobile network (4G) rate. This study’s proposed scheme demonstrates the importance of 5G applications in emergency response and support, in addition to providing a suitable scheme for the integration of 5G networks in the medical scene.},

abstract={Modern buildings are large and complex, and as more time is spent inside them, the risk of indoor disasters such as fires and gas leaks increases. In the event of such a disaster, the success of the rescue operation depends on the ability of the rescue team to navigate and respond to the complex environment. To address this challenge, we designed a mixed reality (MR)-based system simulating indoor disaster rescue. This system uses augmented indoor maps and MR technology to help rescue teams quickly, and effectively respond to unexpected environmental variables and carry out rescue activities. To test the effectiveness of the system, we created a virtual disaster scenario and evaluated the rescue and escape performance within a shortened “golden time” of 2 min, as opposed to 5 min, given the virtual characteristics of the simulation. The results showed that the system is particularly effective at increasing the speed of rescue activities. Additionally, our results indicated the potential for further improvement through additional research. By applying this system for disaster rescue simulations and training, the safety of firefighters and rescuers can be improved by reducing the risk of injury during rescue operations.},

abstract={Background: This article presents the system architecture and validation of the NeuroSuitUp body–machine interface (BMI). The platform consists of wearable robotics jacket and gloves in combination with a serious game application for self-paced neurorehabilitation in spinal cord injury and chronic stroke. Methods: The wearable robotics implement a sensor layer, to approximate kinematic chain segment orientation, and an actuation layer. Sensors consist of commercial magnetic, angular rate and gravity (MARG), surface electromyography (sEMG), and flex sensors, while actuation is achieved through electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and pneumatic actuators. On-board electronics connect to a Robot Operating System environment-based parser/controller and to a Unity-based live avatar representation game. BMI subsystems validation was performed using exercises through a Stereoscopic camera Computer Vision approach for the jacket and through multiple grip activities for the glove. Ten healthy subjects participated in system validation trials, performing three arm and three hand exercises (each 10 motor task trials) and completing user experience questionnaires. Results: Acceptable correlation was observed in 23/30 arm exercises performed with the jacket. No significant differences in glove sensor data during actuation state were observed. No difficulty to use, discomfort, or negative robotics perception were reported. Conclusions: Subsequent design improvements will implement additional absolute orientation sensors, MARG/EMG based biofeedback to the game, improved immersion through Augmented Reality and improvements towards system robustness.},

abstract={Angiogenesis is crucial in the development and progression of tumors. This study examined the relationship between angiogenesis-related lncRNAs (AR-lncRNAs) and breast cancer (BC) immunity and prognosis. We used univariate Cox regression analysis to obtain AR-lncRNAs closely related to BC prognosis. Cluster analysis of BC patients was performed using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) analysis according to the expression of AR-lncRNAs that were prognostically relevant. An AR-lncRNA risk model (AR-lncM) was created using LASSO regression analysis to predict the prognosis and survival of BC patients. Subsequently, the effect of LINC01614 on cell migration and invasion was verified by Transwell and Western blot assays, and the CCK-8 assay detected its impact on cell sensitivity to tamoxifen. Finally, we obtained 17 AR-lncRNAs from the TCGA database that were closely associated with the prognosis of BC patients. Based on the expression of these AR-lncRNAs, BC patients were divided into five clusters using NMF analysis. Cluster 1 was found to have a better prognosis, higher expression of immune checkpoints, and higher levels of immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, an AR-LncM model was created using ten prognostic-related AR-lncRNAs. The model’s risk predictive performance was validated using survival analysis, timeROC curves, and univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. The most interesting gene in the model, LINC01614, was found to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tamoxifen sensitivity in BC cells, implying that LINC01614 could be a potential therapeutic target for BC patients.},

abstract={First responders lose their lives in the line of duty each year, and many of these deaths result from strenuous physical exertion and exposure to harmful environmental agents. Continuous health monitoring may detect diseases and alert the first responder when vital signs are reaching critical levels. However, continuous monitoring must be acceptable to first responders. The purpose of this study was to discover first responders’ current use of wearable technology, their perceptions of what health and environmental indicators should be monitored, and who should be permitted to monitor them. The survey was sent to 645 first responders employed by 24 local fire department stations. A total of 115 (17.8%) first responders answered the survey and 112 were used for analysis. Results found first responders perceived a need for health and environmental monitoring. The health and environmental indicators that respondents perceived as most important for monitoring in the field were heart rate (98.2%) and carbon monoxide (100%), respectively. Overall, using and wearing monitoring devices was not age-dependent and health and environmental concerns were important for first responders at any stage of their career. However, current wearable technology does not seem to be a viable solution for first responders due to device expense and durability issues.},

abstract={The key to preventing mCRPC progression is understanding how androgen-dependent PCa cells progress to independence and modify their transcriptional repertoire accordingly. We recently identified a novel axis of the Hippo pathway characterized by the sequential kinase cascade induced by androgen deprivation, AR−>TLK1B>NEK1>pYAP1-Y407, leading to CRPC adaptation. Phosphorylation of YAP1-Y407 increases upon ADT or induction of DNA damage, correlated with the known increase in NEK1 expression/activity, and this is suppressed in the Y407F mutant. Dominant expression of YAP1-Y407F in Hek293 cells reprograms the YAP1-mediated transcriptome to reduce TEAD- and p73-regulated gene expression and mediates sensitivity to MMC. NEK1 haploinsufficient TRAMP mice display reduced YAP1 expression and, if castrated, fail to progress to overt prostate carcinomas, even while displaying reduced E-Cadherin (E-Cad) expression in hyperplastic ductules. YAP1 overexpression, but not the Y407F mutant, transforms LNCaP cells to androgen-independent growth with a mesenchymal morphology. Immunohistochemical examination of prostate cancer biopsies revealed that the pYAP1-Y407 nuclear signal is low in samples of low-grade cancer but elevated in high GS specimens. We also found that J54, a pharmacological inhibitor of the TLK1>NEK1>YAP1 nexus leading to degradation of YAP1, can suppress the transcriptional reprogramming of LNCaP cells to androgen-independent growth and EMT progression, even when YAP1-WT is overexpressed.},

abstract={Currently, visual Augmented Reality (AR) technology is widespread among the public. Similarly, haptic AR technology is also widely practiced in the academic field. However, conventional haptic AR devices are not suitable for interacting with real objects. These devices are often held by the users, and they contact the real object via the devices. Thus, they prevent direct contact between the user and real objects. To solve this problem, we proposed employing Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) technology. EMS technology does not interfere with the interaction between the user and the real object, and the user can wear the device. First, we examined proper stimulus waveforms for EMS, in addition to pulse waveforms. At the same time, we examined the appropriate frequency and pulse width. The waveforms that we used this time were a sawtooth wave, a reverse sawtooth wave, and a sine wave. Second, to clarify the characteristic of the force presented by the EMS, we measured the relationship between the input voltage and the force presented and obtained the point of subjective equality using the constant method. Subsequently, we presented the bump sensation using EMS to the participants and verified its effectiveness by comparing it with the existing methods.},

abstract={BackgroundMacrophages contribute to epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Exosomal long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) derived from macrophages play a major role in transmitting biological information, whereas related studies on DN are rare. Here we investigated the effects of exosomal lncRNAs from high glucose-treated macrophages on EMT.MethodsHigh glucose-treated macrophage exosomes (HG-exos) were extracted by coprecipitation and stabilized. Then, mouse renal tubular epithelial cells were treated with HG-exos for 24 h. Expression of E-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and fibronectin was detected by western blotting, qPCR, and immunofluorescence. High-throughput sequencing was then applied to analyze the bioinformatics of HG-exos.ResultsHG-exos inhibited the proliferation of tubular epithelial cells. Additionally, HG-exos markedly upregulated α-SMA and fibronectin expression and downregulated E-cadherin expression in tubular epithelial cells, indicating EMT induction. A total of 378 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 674 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified by high-throughput sequencing of HG-exos. Bioinformatics analysis and subsequent qPCR validation suggested 27 lncRNAs were enriched in the EMT-related MAPK pathway. Among them, ENSMUST00000181751.1, XR_001778608.1, and XR_880236.2 showed high homology with humans.ConclusionExosomes from macrophages induce EMT in DN and lncRNAs in exosomes enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway may be the possible mechanism.},

abstract={BackgroundAdequate training and preparation of medical first responders (MFRs) are essential for an optimal performance in highly demanding situations like disasters (e.g., mass accidents, natural catastrophes). The training needs to be as effective as possible, because precise and effective behavior of MFRs under stress is central for ensuring patients’ survival and recovery. This systematic review offers an overview of scientifically evaluated training methods used to prepare MFRs for disasters. It identifies different effectiveness indicators and provides an additional analysis of how and to what extent the innovative training technologies virtual (VR) and mixed reality (MR) are included in disaster training research.MethodsThe systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and focused specifically on (quasi-)experimental studies published between January 2010 and September 2021. The literature search was conducted via Web of Science and PubMed and led to the inclusion of 55 articles.ResultsThe search identified several types of training, including traditional (e.g., lectures, real-life scenario training) and technology-based training (e.g., computer-based learning, educational videos). Most trainings consisted of more than one method. The effectiveness of the trainings was mainly assessed through pre-post comparisons of knowledge tests or self-reported measures although some studies also used behavioral performance measures (e.g., triage accuracy). While all methods demonstrated effectiveness, the literature indicates that technology-based methods often lead to similar or greater training outcomes than traditional trainings. Currently, few studies systematically evaluated immersive VR and MR training.ConclusionTo determine the success of a training, proper and scientifically sound evaluation is necessary. Of the effectiveness indicators found, performance assessments in simulated scenarios are closest to the target behavior during real disasters. For valid yet inexpensive evaluations, objectively assessible performance measures, such as accuracy, time, and order of actions could be used. However, performance assessments have not been applied often. Furthermore, we found that technology-based training methods represent a promising approach to train many MFRs repeatedly and efficiently. These technologies offer great potential to supplement or partially replace traditional training. Further research is needed on those methods that have been underrepresented, especially serious gaming, immersive VR, and MR.},

abstract={Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer death in men, worldwide. Mortality is highly related to metastasis and hormone resistance, but the molecular underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have studied the presence and role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the Epithelial–Mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa, using both in vitro and in vivo models, thereby providing evidence that the stemness–mesenchymal axis seems to be a critical process related to relapse, metastasis and resistance. These are complex and related processes that involve a cooperative action of different cancer cell subpopulations, in which CSCs and mesenchymal cancer cells (MCCs) would be responsible for invading, colonizing pre-metastatic niches, initiating metastasis and an evading treatments response. Manipulating the stemness–EMT axis genes on the androgen receptor (AR) may shed some light on the effect of this axis on metastasis and castration resistance in PCa. It is suggested that the EMT gene SNAI2/Slug up regulates the stemness gene Sox2, and vice versa, inducing AR expression, promoting metastasis and castration resistance. This approach will provide new sight about the role of the stemness–mesenchymal axis in the metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa and their potential control, contributing to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic and castration-resistant PCa.},

abstract={Background: As a form of the Internet of Things (IoT)–gateways, a smart helmet is one of the core devices that offers distinct functionalities. The development of smart helmets connected to IoT infrastructure helps promote connected health and safety in various fields. In this regard, we present a comprehensive analysis of smart helmet technology and its main characteristics and applications for health and safety. Objective: This paper reviews the trends in smart helmet technology and provides an overview of the current and future potential deployments of such technology, the development of smart helmets for continuous monitoring of the health status of users, and the surrounding environmental conditions. The research questions were as follows: What are the main purposes and domains of smart helmets for health and safety? How have researchers realized key features and with what types of sensors? Methods: We selected studies cited in electronic databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO on smart helmets through a keyword search from January 2010 to December 2021. In total, 1268 papers were identified (Web of Science: 87/1268, 6.86%; EBSCO: 149/1268, 11.75%; ScienceDirect: 248/1268, 19.55%; and Google Scholar: 784/1268, 61.82%), and the number of final studies included after PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) study selection was 57. We also performed a self-assessment of the reviewed articles to determine the quality of the paper. The scoring was based on five criteria: test environment, prototype quality, feasibility test, sensor calibration, and versatility. Results: Smart helmet research has been considered in industry, sports, first responder, and health tracking scenarios for health and safety purposes. Among 57 studies, most studies with prototype development were industrial applications (18/57, 32%), and the 2 most frequent studies including simulation were industry (23/57, 40%) and sports (23/57, 40%) applications. From our assessment-scoring result, studies tended to focus on sensor calibration results (2.3 out of 3), while the lowest part was a feasibility test (1.6 out of 3). Further classification of the purpose of smart helmets yielded 4 major categories, including activity, physiological and environmental (hazard) risk sensing, as well as risk event alerting. Conclusions: A summary of existing smart helmet systems is presented with a review of the sensor features used in the prototyping demonstrations. Overall, we aimed to explore new possibilities by examining the latest research, sensor technologies, and application platform perspectives for smart helmets as promising wearable devices. The barriers to users, challenges in the development of smart helmets, and future opportunities for health and safety applications are also discussed. In conclusion, this paper presents the current status of smart helmet technology, main issues, and prospects for future smart helmet with the objective of making the smart helmet concept a reality.},

abstract={Purpose>Focusing on the study of tacit knowledge sharing in nonprofit organizations (NPOs) in Portugal and taking as a case study the Portuguese voluntary firefighters, this study aims to identify the most relevant factors for sharing tacit knowledge and identify the types of barriers most prevalent to such sharing in these organizations.Design/methodology/approach>A literature review on tacit knowledge sharing allowed the identification of indicators and barriers to the sharing of this knowledge. This was followed by a mixed methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative techniques through questionnaires and interviews, whose treatment allowed to determine the indicators that influence each of these factors and which types of barriers.Findings>Three factors have been identified that lead to the sharing of tacit knowledge within these organizations: organizational culture, individual characteristics and organizational structure. Four typologies of barriers were identified: communicational, technological, personal and resource or infrastructure.Research limitations/implications>The present research focuses exclusively on the sharing of tacit knowledge, not considering other forms of knowledge. As a case study, although with heterogeneous organizations, the same cannot be replicated to different realities.Practical implications>The investigation of the main factors and the main types of barriers that arise to the sharing of tacit knowledge in these organizations may serve as a basis for the creation of diagnostic and intervention tools.Originality/value>Studies in this area targeting NPOs are scarce, as opposed to what is happening in the private and public sectors. The option of a case study of organizations such as the Portuguese fire brigades, unique in their action and identity, accompanies the need increasingly recognized by society, in enabling these organizations of competencies for the best possible performance, in the face of tragic events that have occurred in recent years in Portugal.},

abstract={The functional role of microRNA-375 (miR-375) in the development of prostate cancer (PCa) remains controversial. Previously, we found that plasma exosomal miR-375 is significantly elevated in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) patients compared with castration-sensitive PCa patients. Here, we aimed to determine how miR-375 modulates CRPC progression and thereafter to evaluate the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hucMSC)-derived exosomes loaded with miR-375 antisense oligonucleotides (e-375i). We used miRNA in situ hybridization technique to evaluate miR-375 expression in PCa tissues, gain- and loss-of-function experiments to determine miR-375 function, and bioinformatic methods, dual-luciferase reporter assay, qPCR, IHC and western blotting to determine and validate the target as well as the effects of miR-375 at the molecular level. Then, e-375i complexes were assessed for their antagonizing effects against miR-375. We found that the expression of miR-375 was elevated in PCa tissues and cancer exosomes, correlating with the Gleason score. Forced expression of miR-375 enhanced the expression of EMT markers and AR but suppressed apoptosis markers, leading to enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion, and enzalutamide resistance and decreased apoptosis of PCa cells. These effects could be reversed by miR-375 silencing. Mechanistically, miR-375 directly interfered with the expression of phosphatase nonreceptor type 4 (PTPN4), which in turn stabilized phosphorylated STAT3. Application of e-375i could inhibit miR-375, upregulate PTPN4 and downregulate p-STAT3, eventually repressing the growth of PCa. Collectively, we identified a novel miR-375 target, PTPN4, that functions upstream of STAT3, and targeting miR-375 may be an alternative therapeutic for PCa, especially for CRPC with high AR levels.Prostate cancer: stem cell treatment targets microRNAA microRNA shown to promote prostate cancer growth can be targeted through a treatment derived from stem cells. Prostate cancer is lethal for many men, and its growth is promoted by testosterone. However, some “castration-resistant” strains keep growing even after treatments that reduce testosterone levels. Xiaoyi Huang at Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, China, and co-workers examined the role of microRNA-375 in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer. They found that microRNA-375 was over-expressed in cancer tissue samples and promoted tumor growth by interfering with a specific signaling pathway. The team applied a treatment comprising extracellular vesicles called exosomes that are derived from human stem cells and loaded with molecules that suppress microRNA-375. The treatment inhibited microRNA-375 and thereby repressed the cancer growth, while also reducing the cancer’s resistance to the testosterone-blocking drug enzalutamide.},

abstract={Background: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134) states that it is an employer’s responsibility to establish and maintain a respiratory protection program when a respirator is necessary to protect the health of employees, including annual assessment of adequate respirator fit. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, N95 respirators were rarely used in Philadelphia skilled-nursing facilities (SNFs), and many facilities did not have programs in place or materials to fit test their staff. Methods: The Philadelphia Department of Public Health’s (PDPH) Healthcare Associated Infections/Antimicrobial Resistance (HAI/AR) Program designed and pilot-tested 1.5-hour “train-the-trainer” sessions on OSHA-compliant fit-testing requirements and qualitative procedures. This training was offered to all 47 SNFs beginning May 2021. Training covered the role N95 respirators play in healthcare, proper donning and doffing, OSHA training requirements, medical clearances, record keeping, fit-testing procedure, and demonstrated competency to perform fit testing. Resources that were provided after training included templates of a respiratory protection policy for SNFs, a fit-test record, the OSHA medical clearance form, and a competency checklist. This bundle was designed to help SNFs establish self-sustaining respiratory protection programs. Post-training evaluations were administered on a 6-point Likert scale as well as qualitative, open-ended questions to evaluate the overall quality and effectiveness of the training session. Results: In total, 50 employees (clinical and nonclinical) from 13 Philadelphia SNFs received N95 fit-test training from June through December 2021. The average rating for the training overall was very high (5.9 of 6 points). On average, participants strongly agreed that content presented was directly applicable to their work (5.9 of 6 points), and most strongly agreed that information they learned would alter practices and procedures (5.79 of 6 points). When asked qualitatively what the participant would do differently in practice as a result of the training, the most frequent responses were fit test staff (58%) and educate staff on proper N95 use (60%). Conclusions: The PDPH HAI/AR program created a successful pilot fit-test training program for SNFs, demonstrated by program enrollment and high ratings by participants. This relatively low-cost intervention has provided tools to enhance respiratory protection during the COVID-19 pandemic and has increases the capacity of SNFs to provide essential services for their staff and residents. The PDPH will continue to offer these training sessions to SNFs, with plans to expand to other care settings, such as inpatient behavioral health facilities, outpatient clinics, and emergency medical services.Funding: Funded by the CDC ELC Project FirstlineDisclosures: None},

abstract={Background: In recent years, the delivery of evidence-based therapies targeting posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been the focus of the Departments of Defense in countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States. More than 66% of military members continue to experience symptoms of PTSD that significantly impact their daily functioning and quality of life after completing evidence-based treatments. Innovative, engaging, and effective treatments for PTSD are needed. Multimodal motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) is an exposure-based, virtual reality–supported therapy used to treat military members and veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Given the demonstrated efficacy of 3MDR in recently published randomized control trials, there is both an interest in and a need to adapt the intervention to other populations affected by trauma and to improve accessibility to the treatment. Objective: We aimed to further innovate, develop, and validate new and existing hardware and software components of 3MDR to enhance its mobility, accessibility, feasibility, and applicability to other populations affected by trauma, including public safety personnel (PSP), via international collaboration. Methods: This study used a modified Delphi expert consultation method and mixed methods quasi-experimental validation with the purpose of software validation among PSP (first responders, health care providers) participants (N=35). A team of international experts from the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada met on the web on a weekly basis since September 2020 to discuss the adoption of 3MDR in real-world contexts, hardware and software development, and software validation. The evolution of 3MDR hardware and software was undertaken followed by a mixed methods software validation study with triangulation of results to inform the further development of 3MDR. Results: This study resulted in the identification, description, and evolution of hardware and software components and the development of new 3MDR software. Within the software validation, PSP participants widely acknowledged that the newly developed 3MDR software would be applicable and feasible for PSP affected by trauma within their professions. The key themes that emerged from the thematic analysis among the PSP included the desire for occupationally tailored environments, individually tailored immersion, and the applicability of 3MDR beyond military populations. Conclusions: Within the modified Delphi consultation and software validation study, support for 3MDR as an intervention was communicated. PSP participants perceived that 3MDR was relevant for populations affected by trauma beyond military members and veterans. The resulting hardware and software evolution addressed the recommendations and themes that arose from PSP participants. 3MDR is a novel, structured, exposure-based, virtual reality–supported therapy that is currently used to treat military members and veterans with PTSD. Going forward, it is necessary to innovate and adapt 3MDR, as well as other trauma interventions, to increase effectiveness, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and efficacy among other populations affected by trauma.},

abstract={Wearable devices are widely used in the smart healthcare monitoring system to detect changes in user parameters through applications such as wristwatches, bands, and clothing electronic skin. In addition, multimode devices enable monitoring of vital signs, helping diagnose and prevent diseases. A wearable device detects the user's biological signals such as body temperature, movement, heartbeat, and humidity level, transmits the information to the mobile phone, and sends the information to an emergency center/family/clinician through cloud computing or wireless communication systems. This all‐day monitoring system enables the user's status information to be monitored 24 h a day to ensure appropriate treatment, thereby facilitating highly personalized care due to its human‐centricity. When integrated with higher‐level infrastructure, it is expected to be useful in healthcare scenarios, providing benefits to multiple stakeholders. In addition, it will help protect people exposed to potentially life‐threatening environments such as military personnel, first responders, and deep‐sea and space explorers. In this review, the components for implementing an all‐day monitoring system are described, including the electrode design strategy for realizing a skin attachable e‐skin device. Issues related to flexible storage devices and recent research results are also discussed.},

abstract={Major natural disasters have occurred frequently in the last few years, resulting in increased loss of life and economic damage. Most emergency responders do not have first-hand experience with major natural disasters, and thus, there is an urgent need for pre-disaster training. Due to the scenes unreality of traditional emergency drills, the failure to appeal to the target audience and the novel coronavirus pandemic, people are forced to maintain safe social distancing. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out transregional or transnational emergency drills in many countries under the lockdown. There is an increasing demand for simulation training systems that use virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality visualization technologies to simulate major natural disasters. The simulation training system related to natural disasters provides a new way for popular emergency avoidance science education and emergency rescue personnel to master work responsibilities and improve emergency response capabilities. However, to our knowledge, there is no overview of the simulation training system for major natural disasters. Hence, this paper uncovers the visualization techniques commonly used in simulation training systems, and compares, analyses and summarizes the architecture and functions of the existing simulation training systems for different emergency phases of common natural disasters. In addition, the limitations of the existing simulation training system in practical applications and future development directions are discussed to provide reference for relevant researchers to better understand the modern simulation training system.},

abstract={Face masks are an important way to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the prolonged pandemic has revealed confounding problems with the current face masks, including not only the spread of the disease but also concurrent psychological, social, and economic complications. As face masks have been worn for a long time, people have been interested in expanding the purpose of masks from protection to comfort and health, leading to the release of various “smart” mask products around the world. To envision how the smart masks will be extended, this paper reviewed 25 smart masks (12 from commercial products and 13 from academic prototypes) that emerged after the pandemic. While most smart masks presented in the market focus on resolving problems with user breathing discomfort, which arise from prolonged use, academic prototypes were designed for not only sensing COVID-19 but also general health monitoring aspects. Further, we investigated several specific sensors that can be incorporated into the mask for expanding biophysical features. On a larger scale, we discussed the architecture and possible applications with the help of connected smart masks. Namely, beyond a personal sensing application, a group or community sensing application may share an aggregate version of information with the broader population. In addition, this kind of collaborative sensing will also address the challenges of individual sensing, such as reliability and coverage. Lastly, we identified possible service application fields and further considerations for actual use. Along with daily-life health monitoring, smart masks may function as a general respiratory health tool for sports training, in an emergency room or ambulatory setting, as protection for industry workers and firefighters, and for soldier safety and survivability. For further considerations, we investigated design aspects in terms of sensor reliability and reproducibility, ergonomic design for user acceptance, and privacy-aware data-handling. Overall, we aim to explore new possibilities by examining the latest research, sensor technologies, and application platform perspectives for smart masks as one of the promising wearable devices. By integrating biomarkers of respiration symptoms, a smart mask can be a truly cutting-edge device that expands further knowledge on health monitoring to reach the next level of wearables.},

abstract={Objective:The objective of this study was to identify the perceived problems by medical and nursing professionals that have arisen in the Spanish Emergency Medical Services (EMS) as a consequence of the first wave of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as the measures or solutions adopted to manage those problems and improve response.Method:This was a cross-sectional study of quantitative and qualitative methodology (“mixed methods”) using a self-administered questionnaire in 23 key informants of EMS of Spain selected by purposeful sampling, followed by the statistical analysis of both types of variables and an integration of the results in the discussion.Results:Common problems had been identified in many EMS, as well as similar solutions in some of them. Among the former, the following had been found: lack of leadership and support from managers, initial shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), lack of participation in decision making, initial lack of clinical protocols, and slowness and/or lack of adaptability of the system, among others. Among the solutions adopted: reinforcement of emergency call centers, development of specific coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) telephone lines and new resources, personal effort of professionals, new functions of EMS, support to other structures, and reinforcement of the role of nursing.Conclusion:The general perception among the respondents was that there was a lack of support and communication with health care managers and that the staff expertise was not used by policy makers to make decisions adapted to reality, also expressing the need to improve the capacity for analysis of the EMS response. Few respondents reported good overall satisfaction with their EMS response. The EMS adopted different types of measures to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract={The Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) is a technology used in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) that is used efficiently for remote healthcare services. TMIS services can be provided as cloud computing services for storage and processing purposes. TMIS uses wearable sensors to collect patient data and transmit it to the controller node over a public channel. The data is then obtained from the controller node by the medical server and stored in the database for analysis. However, an attacker can attempt to launch attacks on data transferred across an unsecured channel. Several schemes have therefore been proposed to provide mutual authentication however, there are security and performance problems. Therefore, the research aims to design two secure and efficient inter-BAN authentication protocols for WBAN: protocol-I (P-I) for emergency authentication and protocol-II (P-II) for periodic authentication. To analyze the proposed protocols, we conduct an informal security analysis, implement Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic analysis, validate the proposed protocols using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulation tool, and conduct a performance analysis. Consequently, we show that the proposed protocols meet all the security requirements in this research, achieve mutual authentication, prevent passive and active attacks, and have suitable performance for WBAN.},

abstract={In the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, the internet of things (IoT) will play a crucial role in collecting and analyzing information related to human healthcare, public safety, environmental monitoring and home/industrial automation. Even though conventional batteries are widely used to operate IoT devices as a power source, these batteries have a drawback of limited capacity, which impedes broad commercialization of the IoT. In this regard, piezoelectric energy harvesting technology has attracted a great deal of attention because piezoelectric materials can convert electricity from mechanical and vibrational movements in the ambient environment. In particular, piezoelectric-based flexible energy harvesters can precisely harvest tiny mechanical movements of muscles and internal organs from the human body to produce electricity. These inherent properties of flexible piezoelectric harvesters make it possible to eliminate conventional batteries for lifetime extension of implantable and wearable IoTs. This paper describes the progress of piezoelectric perovskite material-based flexible energy harvesters for self-powered IoT devices for biomedical/wearable electronics over the last decade.},

abstract={Monkeypox, an infectious virus that is a member of the Poxviridae family, has raised great threats to humans. Compared to the known oncoviruses, the relationship between monkeypox and cancer still remains obscure. Hence, in this study, we analyzed the multi-omics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database by using genomic and transcriptomic approaches to comprehensively assess the monkeypox-related genes (MRGs) in tumor samples from 33 types of cancers. Based on the results, the expression of MRGs was highly correlated with the immune infiltration and could be further utilized to predict survival in cancer patients. Furthermore, it was shown that tumorigenesis and patient survival were frequently associated with the genomic alterations of MRGs. Moreover, pathway analysis showed that MRGs participated in the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), DNA damage, and hormone androgen receptor (AR), as well as RAS/MAPK and RTK signaling pathways. Besides, we also developed the prognostic features and consensus clustering clusters of MRGs in cancers. Lastly, by mining the cancer drug sensitivity genomics database, we further identified a series of candidate drugs that may target MRGs. Collectively, this study revealed genomic alterations and clinical features of MRGs, which may provide new hints to explore the potential molecular mechanisms between viruses and cancers as well as to provide new clinical guidance of cancer patients who also face the threats during the monkeypox epidemic.},

abstract={Simple SummaryProstate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in US men. Resistance to standard medical castration and secondary taxane-based chemotherapy, the presence of cancer stem-like cells representing epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT), and neuroendocrine (NEPC) subtypes are serious causes of concern for prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. Drug development against these advanced/lethal variants of PCa is, therefore, a significant unmet challenge. We have designed a novel computational prediction algorithm called “secDrug” that identified novel secondary drugs for the management of advanced-stage cancers. Using FK866 (a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase/NAMPT inhibitor) as a proof-of-concept secDrug, we established a novel, universally applicable, preclinical drug development pipeline that incorporates bulk-tumor and single-cell RNA sequencing, microfluidics, as well as in vitro (cell line models representing clinically advanced PCa), and patient-based validation to introduce secondary drug choices to potentially circumvent subclonal aggressiveness, drug resistance, and stemness for the management of lethal subtypes of PCa.AbstractMetastatic prostate cancer/PCa is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in US men. Most early-stage PCa are dependent on overexpression of the androgen receptor (AR) and, therefore, androgen deprivation therapies/ADT-sensitive. However, eventual resistance to standard medical castration (AR-inhibitors) and secondary chemotherapies (taxanes) is nearly universal. Further, the presence of cancer stem-like cells (EMT/epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation) and neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC) subtypes significantly contribute to aggressive/lethal/advanced variants of PCa (AVPC). In this study, we introduced a pharmacogenomics data-driven optimization-regularization-based computational prediction algorithm (“secDrugs”) to predict novel drugs against lethal PCa. Integrating secDrug with single-cell RNA-sequencing/scRNAseq as a ‘Double-Hit’ drug screening tool, we demonstrated that single-cells representing drug-resistant and stem-cell-like cells showed high expression of the NAMPT pathway genes, indicating potential efficacy of the secDrug FK866 which targets NAMPT. Next, using several cell-based assays, we showed substantial impact of FK866 on clinically advanced PCa as a single agent and in combination with taxanes or AR-inhibitors. Bulk-RNAseq and scRNAseq revealed that, in addition to NAMPT inhibition, FK866 regulates tumor metastasis, cell migration, invasion, DNA repair machinery, redox homeostasis, autophagy, as well as cancer stemness–related genes, HES1 and CD44. Further, we combined a microfluidic chip-based cell migration assay with a traditional cell migration/‘scratch’ assay and demonstrated that FK866 reduces cancer cell invasion and motility, indicating abrogation of metastasis. Finally, using PCa patient datasets, we showed that FK866 is potentially capable of reversing the expression of several genes associated with biochemical recurrence, including IFITM3 and LTB4R. Thus, using FK866 as a proof-of-concept candidate for drug repurposing, we introduced a novel, universally applicable preclinical drug development pipeline to circumvent subclonal aggressiveness, drug resistance, and stemness in lethal PCa.},

abstract={Simple SummaryAt a genomic level metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer state is highly heterogeneous and no clear genome-based prognostic or predictive biomarkers exist in practice. We evaluated multiple copy number somatic alterations in two castrate resistant patient cohorts to determine if a genome-based risk score at the copy number level can predict clinical outcomes. The first cohort included patients in a prospective clinical-trial in which abiraterone acetate was given and the other comprised of a real-world hospital-registry. We extracted plasma cell free DNA in both cohorts and performed low pass whole genome sequencing. Copy number alterations were identified for 24 candidate genes and a final composite score developed from 11 genes. This risk score was able to predict survival in castrate resistant patients after adjusting for known clinical biomarkers. Additionally, the multi-gene copy number alteration based risk score algorithm also predicted if abiraterone acetate would be effective in castrate resistant patients.Abstract: BackgroundA plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) multi-gene copy number alteration (CNA)-based risk score was evaluated to predict clinical outcomes in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. Methods: Plasma specimens from two independent mCRPC patient cohorts (N = 88 and N = 92 patients) were used. A treatment-naïve mCRPC cohort (prospective clinical-trial cohort) included plasma samples before treatment with abiraterone acetate/prednisone and serially at 3-months. A separate real-world hospital-registry (RWHR) mCRPC cohort included a single blood sample collected prior to mCRPC treatments in 92 mCRPC patients following ADT failure. Low pass whole genome sequencing was performed on plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and copy number alterations (CNAs) were identified for 24 candidate genes of interest. Associations of individual gene CNAs with 3 month primary resistance to therapy, progression-free survival (PFS) in the prospective trial cohort and overall survival (OS) in both cohorts was evaluated by Cox regression. A multi-gene risk score was determined for significantly associated candidate CNAs for predicting clinical outcomes. Clinical factors were included in the risk model for survival. Statistical significance for all tests was set at 0.05. Results: In the prospective trial cohort, patients responding to treatment were observed to have a significant copy number decrease in AR (p = 0.001) and COL22A1 (p = 0.037) at 3 months, while the non-responder group showed a significant CNA decrease in NKX3.1 (p = 0.027), ZBTB16 (p = 0.025) and CNA increases in PIK3CB (p = 0.006). Based on the significance level of each gene, CNAs in 11 of the 24 genes (AR, COL22A1, MYC, NCOR1, NKX3.1, NOTCH1, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, TMPRSS2, TP53, ZBTB16) were selected to develop a Cox-regression coefficient-based weighted multi-gene risk score for predicting mCRPC outcomes in both cohorts. A higher multi-gene risk score was observed to have poor OS in mCRPC patients in the prospective trial cohort (p = 0.00019) and for the RWHR cohort, (p < 0.0001). A higher risk score was also associated with poor PFS in the prospective cohort (p = 0.0043). Conclusions: A multi-gene CNAs-based risk score derived from plasma cfDNA may predict treatment response and prognosticate survival in mCRPC and warrants prospective validation of risk-based algorithms.},

abstract={Systemic hypertension has been recognized as a modifiable traditional cardiovascular risk factor and influenced by many factors such as eating habits, physical activity, diabetes, and obesity. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to identify factors that predict changes in blood pressure induced by a one-year lifestyle intervention in primary care settings involving a collaboration between family physicians, dietitians, and exercise specialists. Patients with metabolic syndrome diagnosis were recruited by family physicians participating in primary care lifestyle intervention among several family care clinics across Canada. Participants for whom all cardiometabolic data at the beginning (T0) and the end (T12) of the one-year intervention were available were included in the present analysis (n = 101). Patients visited the dietitian and the exercise specialist weekly for the first three months and monthly for the last nine months. Diet quality, exercise capacity, anthropometric indicators, and cardiometabolic variables were evaluated at T0 and at T12. The intervention induced a statistically significant decrease in waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and plasma triglycerides, and an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness (estimated VO2max). Body weight (p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), and fasting blood glucose (p = 0.006) reduction, and VO2max increase (p = 0.048) were all related to changes in SBP. WC was the only variable for which changes were significantly correlated with those in both SBP (p < 0.0001) and DBP (p = 0.0004). Variations in DBP were not associated with changes in other cardiometabolic variables to a statistically significant extent. Twelve participants were identified as adverse responders (AR) in both SBP and DBP and displayed less favorable changes in WC. The beneficial effects of the primary care lifestyle intervention on blood pressure were significantly associated with cardiometabolic variables, especially WC. These findings suggest that a structured lifestyle intervention in primary care can help improve cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome and that WC should be systematically measured to better stratify the patient’s hypertension risk.},

abstract={The mechanisms by which prostate cancer (PCa) progresses to the aggressive castration-resistant stage remain uncertain. Zinc finger of the cerebellum 5 (ZIC5), a transcription factor belonging to the ZIC family, is involved in the pathology of various cancers. However, the potential effect of ZIC5 on PCa malignant progression has not been fully defined. Here, we show that ZIC5 is upregulated in PCa, particularly in metastatic lesions, in positive association with poor prognosis. Genetic inhibition of ZIC5 in PCa cells obviously attenuated invasion and metastasis and blunted the oncogenic properties of colony formation. Mechanistically, ZIC5 functioned as a transcription factor to promote TWIST1-mediated EMT progression or as a cofactor to strengthen the β-catenin-TCF4 association and stimulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, ZIC5 and the androgen receptor (AR) form a positive feed-forward loop to mutually stimulate each other’s expression. AR, in cooperation with its steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3), increased ZIC5 expression through binding to the miR-27b-3p promoter and repressing miR-27b-3p transcription. In turn, ZIC5 potentiated AR, AR-V7, and AR targets’ expression. Besides, ZIC5 inhibition reduced AR and AR-V7 protein expression and enhanced the sensitivity of PCa to enzalutamide (Enz) treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate that the reciprocal activation between AR and ZIC5 promotes metastasis and Enz resistance of PCa and suggest the therapeutic value of cotargeting ZIC5 and AR for the treatment of advanced PCa.},

abstract={Sex differences in the immune system are well documented in a wide range of organisms including sea urchins, fruit flies, mice and humans. 4 In humans, females generally elicit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses than males, which protects them better from infections and augments vaccine-efficacy. ...]it renders women more susceptible to autoimmune diseases and reduces the efficacy of immunotherapeutic interventions. 1,4 In contrast, treatments to suppress immune responses in the context of autoimmune diseases appear to work better in males. 1,4 Sex differences in the immune system can be genome encoded or hormone mediated, where the former occur at all stages of life, while hormone driven differences appear only post-puberty. 4 Multiple genes with functions in the immune system, including TLR7, FOXP3, CD40L, IL2RG, XIAP and BTK, are X-linked and reactivation of the usually silent second X chromosome in females promotes sex differences in the immune system. 5 Sex hormones also play a central role in establishing immunological sex differences by acting directly on immune cells or indirectly by shaping the tissue niches they reside in. 6,7 For example, we have shown that sex hormones act on adipose tissue to control the distribution, phenotype and function of tissue-resident regulatory T cells in a sex-specific manner. 7 Further supporting the role of sex hormones in the immune system, two recent studies, published in Immunity and Nature, have revealed how androgen receptor (AR) signalling can skew CD8+ T-cell differentiation and limit their anti-tumour function. 8,9 CD8+ T cells are critical to fight against intracellular pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. Sex bias in incidence and mortality has been reported in several human cancers. 3 To test the immunological mechanisms underpinning this observation, Yang et al. 8 used three distinct murine cancer models (MC38 colon cancer, B16-SIY melanoma and DEN hepatocellular carcinoma), all of which showed higher tumour burden and fewer tumour-infiltrating T cells in males. The authors chose metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients that were first treated with enzalutamide (AR blocker) and subsequently responded favourably or failed to respond to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) treatment. 9 scRNAseq of lymphocytes isolated from tumour biopsies revealed an enrichment of a cytotoxic gene signature in CD8+ T cells among the responders, while Hsp90, which facilitates AR function, was expressed higher in CD8+ T cells from patients who did not respond to anti-PD1 blockade.},

abstract={Recent advances in techniques to improve indoor localization accuracy for personnel and asset tracking challenges has enabled wide-spread adoption within the retail, manufacturing, and health care industries. Most currently deployed systems use distance estimates from known reference locations to localize a person or asset using geometric lateration techniques. The distances are determined using one of many radio frequency (RF) based ranging techniques. Unfortunately, such techniques are susceptible to interference and multipath propagation caused by obstructions within buildings. Because range inaccuracies from known locations can directly lead to incorrect position estimates, these systems often require careful upfront deployment design to account for site-specific interference sources. However, the upfront system deployment requirements necessary to achieve high positioning accuracy with RF-based ranging systems makes the use of such systems impractical, particularly for structures constructed of challenging materials or dense configurations. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the accuracy and precision of alternative RF-based devices within a range of indoor spaces composed of different materials and sizes. These spaces range from large open areas such as gymnasiums to confined engineering labs of traditional buildings as well as training buildings at the local Fire Department Training Facility. Our goal is to identify the impact of alternative RF-based systems on localization accuracy and precision specifically for first responders that are called upon to traverse structures composed of different materials and configurations. Consequently, in this study we have specifically chosen spaces that are likely to be encountered by firefighters during building fires or emergency medical responses. Moreover, many of these indoor spaces can be considered hostile using RF-based ranging techniques. We built prototype wearable localization edge devices designed for first responders and characterize both ranging and localization accuracy and precision using alternative transceivers including Bluetooth Low Energy, 433 MHz, 915 MHz, and ultra-wide band. Our results show that in hostile environments, using ultra-wide band transceivers for localization consistently outperforms the alternatives in terms of precision and accuracy.},

abstract={Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is widely used in rehabilitation and athletic training to generate involuntary muscle contractions. However, EMS leads to rapid muscle fatigue, limiting the force a muscle can produce during prolonged use. Currently available methods to monitor localized muscle fatigue and recovery are generally not compatible with EMS. The purpose of this study was to examine whether Doppler ultrasound imaging can assess changes in stimulated muscle twitches that are related to muscle fatigue from electrical stimulation. We stimulated five isometric muscle twitches in the medial and lateral gastrocnemius of 13 healthy subjects before and after a fatiguing EMS protocol. Tissue Doppler imaging of the medial gastrocnemius recorded muscle tissue velocities during each twitch. Features of the average muscle tissue velocity waveforms changed immediately after the fatiguing stimulation protocol (peak velocity: -38%, p = .022; time-to-zero velocity: +8%, p = .050). As the fatigued muscle recovered, the features of the average tissue velocity waveforms showed a return towards their baseline values similar to that of the normalized ankle torque. We also found that features of the average tissue velocity waveform could significantly predict the ankle twitch torque for each participant (R2 = 0.255–0.849, p < .001). Our results provide evidence that Doppler ultrasound imaging can detect changes in muscle tissue during isometric muscle twitch that are related to muscle fatigue, fatigue recovery, and the generated joint torque. Tissue Doppler imaging may be a feasible method to monitor localized muscle fatigue during EMS in a wearable device.},

abstract={Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common causes of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men, which is characterized by a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. BPH troubles the vast majority of aging men worldwide; however, the pathogenetic factors of BPH have not been completely identified. The heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) subfamily, which mainly includes HSP70, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP75, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. HSP70s are overexpressed in the course of BPH and involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell survival and proliferation, cell apoptosis, epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis, contributing to the development and progress of prostate diseases. These chaperone proteins also participate in oxidative stress, a cellular stress response that takes place under stress conditions. In addition, HSP70s can bind to the androgen receptor (AR) and act as a regulator of AR activity. This interaction of HSP70s with AR provides insight into the importance of the HSP70 chaperone family in BPH pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the function of the HSP70 family in prostate glands and the role of HSP70s in the course of BPH. We also review the potential applications of HSP70s as biomarkers of prostate diseases for targeted therapies.},

abstract={BackgroundParamedic professionals’ fatigue is rising 1 2. Stress factors show increased risk for burnout and fatigue, leaving the profession, decreased performance and risk for patient safety. (1) Meanwhile, paramedics’ strong community of practice, autonomy of practice and a sense of professional respect are important factors in forming psychological resilience.3 This study aimed to explore Finnish paramedics’ perceptions of job demands and resources.MethodA cross-sectional descriptive study with qualitative design, utilizing an inductive constructivist approach. The study used reflexive thematic analysis, by Braun and Clarke, to analyse two data sets of responses from professional Finnish paramedics; open-ended questions from a web-based survey (n=174) and essays written by masters-degree students (n=34).ResultsThe results were categorized into job demands or resources, as defined in Job Demands and Resource model by Demerouti and Bakker. Themes identified as paramedics’ job demands were continuous stress from mentally burdening work (high workload, environmental stress factors and bearing patients’ and relatives’ emotional burden), uncertainty under expectation pressures (sense of inadequacy and a pressure to perform) and organizational lack of support. Themes identified as paramedics’ job resources were pressure management strategies (distancing coping mechanisms, ability to handle clinical demands and ability to affect own work) and professional self-actualization (psychologically safe work community, professional sense of pride and internal drive to professional development).ConclusionFinnish paramedics exhibit both job demands and resources. Performance pressure, uncertainty and emotional burden and also environmental hazards and psychological safety in communities. This indicates a need to address not only physical aspects of the paramedic work but also early stage performance expectations and organizational cultures.Lawn S, Roberts L, Willis E, Couzner L, Mohammadi L, Goble E.

abstract={Therapy-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC/NEPC) is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer (PCa) that frequently emerges in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) under the selective pressure of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies. This variant is extremely aggressive, metastasizes to visceral organs, tissues, and bones despite low serum PSA, and is associated with poor survival rates. It arises via a reversible trans-differentiation process, referred to as ‘neuroendocrine differentiation’ (NED), wherein PCa cells undergo a lineage switch and exhibit neuroendocrine features, characterized by the expression of neuronal markers such as enolase 2 (ENO2), chromogranin A (CHGA), and synaptophysin (SYP). The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying NED in PCa are complex and not clearly understood, which contributes to a lack of effective molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy of this variant. NEPC is thought to derive from prostate adenocarcinomas by clonal evolution. A characteristic set of genetic alterations, such as dual loss of retinoblastoma (RB1) and tumor protein (TP53) tumor suppressor genes and amplifications of Aurora kinase A (AURKA), NMYC, and EZH2, has been reported to drive NEPC. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important epigenetic players in driving NED in advanced PCa. In this review, we highlight the role of miRNAs in NEPC. These studies emphasize the diverse role that miRNAs play as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in driving NEPC. These studies have unveiled the important role of cellular processes such as the EMT and cancer stemness in determining NED in PCa. Furthermore, miRNAs are involved in intercellular communication between tumor cells and stromal cells via extracellular vesicles/exosomes that contribute to lineage switching. Recent studies support the promising potential of miRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for NEPC.},

abstract={OIRD (opioid-induced respiratory depression) remains a significant public health concern due to clinically indicated and illicit opioid use. Respiratory depression is the sine qua non of opioid toxicity, and early detection is critical for reversal using pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. In addition to respiratory monitoring devices such as pulse oximetry, capnography, and contactless monitoring systems, novel implantable sensors and detection systems such as optical detection and electrochemical detection techniques are being developed to identify the presence of opioids both in vivo and within the environment. These new technologies will not only monitor for signs and symptoms of OIRD but also serve as a mechanism to alert and assist first responders and lay rescuers. The current opioid epidemic brings to the forefront the need for additional accessible means of detection and diagnosis. Rigorous evaluation of safety, efficacy, and acceptability will be necessary for both new and established technologies to have an impact on morbidity and mortality associated with opioid toxicity. Here, we summarized existing and advanced technologies for opioid detection and OIRD management with a focus on recent advancements in wearable and implantable opioid detection. We expect that this review will serve as a complete informative reference for the researchers and healthcare professionals working on the subject and allied fields.},

abstract={Collecting sweat and monitoring its rate is important for determining body condition and further sweat analyses, as this provides vital information about physiologic status and fitness level and could become an alternative to invasive blood tests in the future. Presented here is a one-dollar, disposable, paper-based microfluidic chip for real-time monitoring of sweat rate. The chip, pasted on any part of the skin surface, consists of a skin adhesive layer, sweat-proof layer, sweat-sensing layer, and scale layer with a disk-shape from bottom to top. The sweat-sensing layer has an impressed wax micro-channel containing pre-added chromogenic agent to show displacement by sweat, and the sweat volume can be read directly by scale lines without any electronic elements. The diameter and thickness of the complete chip are 25 mm and 0.3 mm, respectively, permitting good flexibility and compactness with the skin surface. Tests of sweat flow rate monitoring on the left forearm, forehead, and nape of the neck of volunteers doing running exercise were conducted. Average sweat rate on left forearm (1156 g·m−2·h−1) was much lower than that on the forehead (1710 g·m−2·h−1) and greater than that on the nape of the neck (998 g·m−2·h−1), in good agreement with rates measured using existing common commercial sweat collectors. The chip, as a very low-cost and convenient wearable device, has wide application prospects in real-time monitoring of sweat loss by body builders, athletes, firefighters, etc., or for further sweat analyses.},

abstract={The main aim of the present study is to evaluate reach, dose, fidelity, and outcomes of the interventions for promoting voluntary exercise training among South Korean firefighters. Four interventions for promoting voluntary exercise training among firefighters (i.e., virtual reality exercise system intervention, poster intervention, monitor intervention, and wearable health device intervention) were performed in a fire station located in Seoul, South Korea. To evaluate reach and dose received related to each intervention, participants were asked to answer several simple questions. Three process evaluators completed a 20-item survey to share their impressions related to the quality of intervention delivery. Paired t test was used to examine mean changes in primary (i.e., mean minutes of exercise training per week) and secondary outcomes (i.e., beliefs and intention) between pre- and postinterventions. More than 60% of participants experienced monitor and wearable health device interventions. Process evaluators tend not to agree with a statement saying that the number of the virtual reality exercise equipment was appropriate. Among firefighters who participated in exercise training less than 150 min per week at 1-month follow-up, mean minutes of exercise training per week increased by 67.95 min after interventions. Future studies need to examine whether the monitor and wearable health device interventions effectively increase exercise training participation among firefighters in other fire stations located in Seoul, South Korea.},

abstract={In the last few years, modern technologies such as numerical simulations, virtual and augmented reality, and agent-based models represented effective tools to study phenomena, which may not be experimentally reproduced due to costs, inherent hazards, or other constraints (e.g., fire or earthquake emergencies and evacuation from buildings). This paper shows how to integrate a virtual reality platform with numerical simulation tools to reproduce an evolutionary fire emergency scenario. It is computed in real time based on the building information model and a fluid dynamic software. A specific software was also used to simulate in real time the crowd dynamic in the virtual environment during the emergency evacuation process. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, the emergency fire evacuation process for an existing school building is presented. The results show that the proposed virtual reality-based system can be employed for reproducing fire emergency scenarios. It can be used to help decision-makers to determine emergency plans and to help firefighters as a training tool to simulate emergency evacuation actions.},

abstract={Background Cabazitaxel improves overall survival (OS) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients progressing after docetaxel. In this prospective study, we evaluated the prognostic role of CTC gene expression on cabazitaxel-treated patients and its association with plasma androgen receptor (AR) copy number (CN). Methods Patients receiving cabazitaxel 20 or 25 mg/sqm for mCRPC were enrolled. Digital PCR was performed to assess plasma AR CN status. CTC enrichment was assessed using the AdnaTest EMT-2/StemCell kit. CTC expression analyses were performed for 17 genes. Data are expressed as hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. Results Seventy-four patients were fully evaluable. CTC expression of AR-V7 (HR=2.52, 1.24–5.12, p=0.011), AKR1C3 (HR=2.01, 1.06–3.81, p=0.031), AR (HR=2.70, 1.46–5.01, p=0.002), EPCAM (HR=3.75, 2.10–6.71, p< 0.0001), PSMA (HR=2.09, 1.19–3.66, p=0.01), MDK (HR=3.35, 1.83–6.13, p< 0.0001), and HPRT1 (HR=2.46, 1.44–4.18, p=0.0009) was significantly associated with OS. ALDH1 (OR=5.50, 0.97–31.22, p=0.05), AR (OR=8.71, 2.32–32.25, p=0.001), EPCAM (OR=7.26, 1.47–35.73, p=0.015), PSMA (OR=3.86, 1.10–13.50, p=0.035), MDK (OR=6.84, 1.87–24.98, p=0.004), and HPRT1 (OR=7.41, 1.82–30.19, p=0.005) expression was associated with early PD. AR CN status was significantly correlated with AR-V7 (p=0.05), EPCAM (p=0.02), and MDK (p=0.002) expression. In multivariable model, EPCAM and HPRT1 CTC expression, plasma AR CN gain, ECOG PS=2, and liver metastases and PSA were independently associated with poorer OS. In patients treated with cabazitaxel 20 mg/sqm, median OS was shorter in AR-V7 positive than negative patients (6.6 versus 14 months, HR=3.46, 1.47–8.17], p=0.004). Conclusions Baseline CTC biomarkers may be prognosticators for cabazitaxel-treated mCRPC patients. Cabazitaxel at lower (20 mg/sqm) dose was associated with poorer outcomes in AR-V7 positive patients compared to AR-V7 negative patients in a post hoc subgroup analysis.

abstract={Search and Rescue (SaR) dogs are important assets in the hands of first responders, as they have the ability to locate the victim even in cases where the vision and or the sound is limited, due to their inherent talents in olfactory and auditory senses. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable’s microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99%) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.},

abstract={Background: Advanced prostate cancer (PC) may accumulate genomic alterations that hallmark lineage plasticity and transdifferentiation to a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a key player in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, its clinical value and role in NE differentiation in advanced PC has not been fully investigated. Methods: Two hundred and eight patients from a multicenter, prospective cohort of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with available RNA sequencing data were analyzed for tumor FAP mRNA expression, and its association with overall survival (OS) and NE tumor features was investigated. Results: Twenty-one patients (10%) were found to have high FAP mRNA expression. Compared to the rest, this subset had a proportionally higher exposure to taxanes and AR signaling inhibitors (abiraterone or enzalutamide) and was characterized by active NE signaling, evidenced by high NEPC- and low AR-gene expression scores. These patients with high tumor mRNA FAP expression had a more aggressive clinical course and significantly shorter survival (12 months) compared to those without altered FAP expression (28 months, log-rank p = 0.016). Conclusions: FAP expression may serve as a valuable NE marker indicating a worse prognosis in patients with metastatic CRPC.},

abstract={BackgroundPropranolol (antagonist of β1-/β2-AR but minimally active against β3-AR) is currently the first-line treatment for infantile hemangiomas (IH). Its efficacy is attributed to the blockade of β2-AR. However, its success rate is ~60%. Considering the growing interest in the angiogenic role of β3-ARs, we evaluated a possible relationship between β3-AR expression and response to propranolol.MethodsFifteen samples of surgical biopsies were collected from patients with IH. Three were taken precociously from infants and then successfully treated with propranolol (responder group). Twelve were taken later, from residual lesions noncompletely responsive to propranolol (nonresponder group). A morphometrical analysis of the percentage of β1-, β2-, and β3-ARs positively stained area was compared between the two groups.ResultsWhile no difference was found in both β1- and β2-AR expression level, a statistically significant increase of β3-AR positively stained area was observed in the nonresponder group.ConclusionsAlthough the number of biopsies is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions, and the different β-AR pattern may be theoretically explained by the different timing of samplings, this study suggests a possible correlation between β3-AR expression and the reduced responsiveness to propranolol treatment. This study could pave the way for new therapeutic perspectives to manage IH.ImpactPropranolol (unselective antagonist of β1 and β2-ARs) is currently the first-line treatment for IHs, with a success rate of ~60%.Its effectiveness has been attributed to its ability to block β2-ARs.However, β3-ARs (on which propranolol is minimally active) were significantly more expressed in hemangioma biopsies taken from patients nonresponsive to propranolol.This study suggests a possible role of β3-ARs in hemangioma pathogenesis and a possible new therapeutic target.},

abstract={Chronic stress induced by long-term anxiety and depression can promote the malignant progression of gastric cancer. β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) is a critical mediator for chronic stress-induced multiple processes of tumor cells. However, the function of chronic stress in gastric cancer and its potential mechanisms in vivo and in vitro, especially at the cellular level, remain unknown. Here, we provide further evidence that chronic stress affected behavior and hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis related hormone levels in mice. Furthermore, immunofluorescence showed that emotion affected the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in patients' tissues. To address this, salbutamol, a specific agonist of β2-AR, was utilized for simulating chronic stress and demonstrating the mechanism of stress in tumor progression at the molecular level both in vivo and in vitro. Salbutamol significantly induced EMT, migration and invasion via ERK (Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation, and the effects were reversed by the β2-AR antagonist ICI-118,551. The promoting effects of salbutamol on EMT, migration and invasion were inhibited by phosphorylation inhibitor of ERK PD98059 in vitro. Analysis of xenograft models revealed that salbutamol significantly promoted tumor growth and adrenal volume, while ICI-118,551 inhibited these effects. In addition, salbutamol increased the expression of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and decreased epithelial marker E-cadherin in transplanted tumor tissue. In conclusion, salbutamol simulates a chronic stress model, which promotes tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells through β2-AR/ERK/EMT pathway.},

abstract={IntroductionThe challenging environment of prehospital casualty care demands providers to make prompt decisions and to engage in lifesaving interventions, occasionally without them being adequately experienced. Telementoring based on augmented reality (AR) devices has the potential to decrease the decision time and minimise the distance gap between an experienced consultant and the first responder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether telementoring with AR glasses would affect chest thoracotomy performance and self-confidence of inexperienced trainees.MethodsTwo groups of inexperienced medical students performed a chest thoracotomy in an ex vivo pig model. While one group was mentored remotely using HoloLens AR glasses, the second performed the procedure independently. An observer assessed the trainees’ performance. In addition, trainees and mentors evaluated their own performance.ResultsQuality of performance was found to be superior with remote guidance, without significant prolongation of the procedure (492 s vs 496 s, p=0.943). Moreover, sense of self-confidence among participant was substantially improved in the telementoring group in which 100% of the participants believed the procedure was successful compared with 40% in the control group (p=0.035).ConclusionAR devices may have a role in future prehospital telementoring systems, to provide accessible consultation for first responders, and could thus positively affect the provider's confidence in decision-making, enhance procedure performance and ultimately improve patient prognosis. That being said, future studies are required to estimate full potential of this technology and additional adjustments are necessary for maximal optimisation and implementation in the field of prehospital care.},

This paper presents a novel training framework for first responders that leverages augmented reality and virtual reality technologies. The framework incorporates novel design thinking processes that are implemented for the design of the training experiences. In addition, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of various metrics such as performance, time on task, accuracy and learning rate are developed to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

abstract={The recent advances of Augmented Reality (AR) in healthcare have shown that technology is a significant part of the current healthcare system. In recent days, augmented reality has proposed numerous intelligent applications in the healthcare domain including, wearable access, telemedicine, remote surgery, diagnosis of medical reports, emergency medicine, etc. These developed augmented healthcare applications aim to improve patient care, increase efficiency, and decrease costs. Therefore, to identify the advances of AR-based healthcare applications, this article puts on an effort to perform an analysis of 45 peer-reviewed journal and conference articles from scholarly databases between 2011 and 2020. It also addresses concurrent concerns and their relevant future challenges including, user satisfaction, convenient prototypes, service availability, maintenance cost, etc. Despite the development of several AR healthcare applications, there are some untapped potentials regarding secure data trans-mission, which is an important factor for advancing this cutting-edge technology. Therefore, this paper also analyzes distinct AR security and privacy including, security requirements (i.e., scalability, confidentiality, integrity, resiliency, etc.) and attack terminologies (i.e. sniffing, fabrication, modification, interception, etc.). Based on the security issues, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence-based dynamic solution to build an intelligent security model to minimize data security risks. This intelligent model can identify seen and unseen threats in the threat detection layer and thus can protect data during data transmission. In addition, it prevents external attacks in the threat elimination layer using threat reduction mechanisms.},

abstract={Androgen receptor (AR) is an androgen-activated transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily. AR plays a role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the exact role of AR in PCa metastasis remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the function of AR in PCa. We found that eukaryotic translation initiation factor (EIF) 5A2, an elongation factor that induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa cells, was significantly upregulated after 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation and downregulated after anti‐androgen bicalutamide treatment in PCa cells with high AR expression, but not in cells with low AR expression. Moreover, eIF5A2 knockdown could eliminate DHT-induced invasion and migration of AR-positive PCa cells. DHT treatment decreased epithelial expression of E‐cadherin and β-catenin but increased the expression of the mesenchymal marker proteins Vimentin and N-cadherin. DHT therefore induced EMT, and knockdown of eIF5A2 inhibited DHT-induced EMT. Moreover, in vivo study, Luciferase signals from the lungs of the eIF5A2 plasmid group indicated higher metastasis ability, and the eIF5A2 siRNA group had lower metastasis ability. Our results suggest that AR positively regulates eIF5A2 expression in androgen-dependent cells, and stimulation of AR expression and signaling in prostate tumors promotes PCa metastasis by EMT induction and upregulation of eIF5A2.},

abstract={Public safety agencies have been working on the modernization of their communication networks and the enhancement of their mission-critical capabilities with novel technologies and applications. As part of these efforts, migrating from traditional land mobile radio (LMR) systems toward cellular-enabled, next-generation, mission-critical networks is at the top of these agencies’ agendas. In this paper, we provide an overview of cellular technologies ratified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to enable next-generation public safety networks. On top of using wireless communication technologies, emergency first responders need to be equipped with advanced devices to develop situational awareness. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the Internet of Life-Saving Things (IoLST) and focus on the role of wearable devices—more precisely, cellular-enabled wearables, in creating new solutions for enhanced public safety operations. Finally, we conduct a performance evaluation of wearable-based, mission-critical applications. So far, most of the mission-critical service evaluations target latency performance without taking into account reliability requirements. In our evaluation, we examine the impact of device- and application-related parameters on the latency and the reliability performance. We also identify major future considerations for better support of the studied requirements in next-generation public safety networks.},

abstract={Background Solitary death (kodokushi) has recently become recognized as a social issue in Japan. The social isolation of older people leads to death without dignity. With the outbreak of COVID-19, efforts to eliminate solitary death need to be adjusted in line with changes in lifestyle and accompanying changes in social structure. Health monitoring services that utilize wearable devices may contribute to this end. Our goals are to outline how wearable devices might be used to (1) detect emergency situations involving solitary older people and swiftly connect them with medical treatment, to (2) reduce the frequency of deaths that remain undiscovered and (3) to reduce social isolation by promoting social interaction. Methods Theoretical and philosophical approaches were adopted to examine ethical issues surrounding the application of wearable devices and cloud-based information processing systems to prevent solitary death in the world with/after COVID-19. Main body (1) Technology cannot replace social connections; without social support necessary to foster understanding of the benefits of health management through wearable devices among older adults, such devices may remain unused, or not used properly. (2) Maturity of the technology; systems face the difficult task of detecting and responding to a wide range of health conditions and life-threatening events in time to avert avoidable morbidity and mortality. (3) Autonomy and personhood; promoting the voluntary use of wearable devices that are a part of larger efforts to connect isolated individuals to a community or social services might be effective. Legal force should be avoided if possible. There is some concern that landlords may require an older person to sign a contract agreeing to wear a device. The autonomy of solitary older people should be respected. (4) Governance: policies must be developed to limit access to data from wearables and the purposes for which data can be used. Conclusion If thoughtfully deployed under proper policy constraints, wearable devices offer a way to connect solitary older people to health services and could reduce cases of solitary death while respecting the personhood of the user.},

abstract={Innovative technology has been an important part of firefighting, as it advances firefighters’ safety and effectiveness. Prior research has examined the implementation of training systems using augmented reality (AR) in other domains, such as welding, aviation, army, and mathematics, offering significant pedagogical affordances. Nevertheless, firefighting training systems using AR are still an under-researched area. The increasing penetration of AR for training is the driving force behind this study, and the scope is to analyze the main aspects affecting the acceptance of AR by firefighters. The current research uses a technology acceptance model, extended by the external constructs of perceived interactivity and personalization, to consider both the system and individual level. The proposed model was evaluated by a sample of 200 users, and the results show that both the external variables of perceived interactivity and perceived personalization are prerequisite factors in extending the TAM model. The findings reveal that the usability is the strongest predictor of firefighters’ behavioral intentions to use the AR system, followed by the ease of use with smaller, yet meaningful, direct and indirect effects on firefighters’ intentions. The identified acceptance factors help AR developers enhance the firefighters’ experience in training operations.},

abstract={Traditional firefighter helmet has the disadvantages of poor shading and lack of flexibility. AR is the process of computing 3d coordinate points according to the image points of real objects, and then superimposing “virtual + real” surreal scenes based on real scenery through the calculation simulation of the processor. The AR firefighter helmet is a new type of firefighting protective that uses AR technology in traditional firefighter helmet. Intelligent firefighter helmet based on AR technology uses 3D simulation imaging technology, thermal camera tracking technology, human-computer interaction technology, and code recognition technology to maximize the effect of realistic fire scenes. It can enable firefighters to see the real situation in the scene of heavy smoke and improve the efficiency of rescue. Therefore, firefighter helmets with AR equipment represent the future development trend of firefighter helmet. This paper discusses the theory, value, technical operation, design and development of intelligence. The research on the fireman’s helmet based on augmented reality technology has leading advantages and application value.},

abstract={With the use of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) proliferating throughout industry and public safety, it is imperative to ensure safety of flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published regulations for commercial use of sUAS in 2016 and included the requirement to maintain visual line-of-sight with the aircraft at all times. However, due to the nature of the sUAS ground control stations (GCS), remote pilots time-share between observing the aircraft and interacting with the display on the GCS. Time-sharing between the aircraft and GCS can be seen as similar to the cross-check a pilot uses when flying a manned aircraft. While manned aircraft designers have invested in the ergonomics and understanding of the cognitive process to optimize situational awareness, it has not been a design requirement for sUAS. The result is that the unmanned operator must change head orientation, eye focus, and remove the aircraft from peripheral vision during the cross-check between the GCS and aircraft. This, coupled with the limited field of view of the sUAS GCS displayed camera, leads to loss of situational awareness through task saturation, and misprioritization. Mixed reality, virtual reality, and augmented reality visual devices are being adopted in the gaming and technical world. The application of these devices to the sUAS GCS could mitigate some of the degradation of situational awareness. Specifically, the incorporation of augmented reality devices where a synthetic display is overlaid on the real-world, allows the remote pilot to observe the aircraft, manipulate the camera, and interact with the GCS without changing head position. This participant observational study evaluated the difference between the remote pilot cross-check while flying with a typical GCS display and when flying with an augmented reality headset in a field setting. The results indicate a significant difference between the pilot’s crosscheck when using augmented reality glasses allowing the pilot to maintain the aircraft in their field of view 56.7% of the time compared to 20.5% when not using the glasses.},

abstract={Enzalutamide (ENZ) is an important drug used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which inhibits androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Previous study showed that 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) is an AR antagonist that also inhibits Wnt signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To investigate whether combined treatment with ENZ and DIM can overcome ENZ resistance by regulating Wnt signaling to inhibit AR signaling and EMT in ENZ-resistant prostate cancer cells, 22Rv1 cells were cultured in normal medium and treated with ENZ, DIM, and DIM with ENZ. Exposure of ENZ-resistant cells to both DIM and ENZ significantly inhibited cell proliferation without cytotoxicity and invasion in comparison with the control. DIM significantly increased the E-cadherin expression and inhibited the expressions of Vimentin and Fibronectin, subsequently inhibiting EMT. Co-treatment with ENZ and DIM significantly increased the expressions of GSK3β and APC and decreased the β-catenin protein expression, causing inhibition of Wnt signaling and AR expression, it also significantly decreased the AR-v7 expression and down-regulated AR signaling. Via suppression of Wnt and AR signaling, co-treatment increased the E-cadherin and decreased the Vimentin and Fibronectin RNA and protein expressions, then inhibited EMT. Co-treatment with DIM and ENZ regulated Wnt signaling to reduce not only the AR expression, but also the AR-v7 expression, indicating suppression of EMT that inhibits cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration to ameliorate ENZ resistance.},

abstract={Telementoring platforms can help transfer surgical expertise remotely. However, most telementoring platforms are not designed to assist in austere, pre-hospital settings. This paper evaluates the system for telementoring with augmented reality (STAR), a portable and self-contained telementoring platform based on an augmented reality head-mounted display (ARHMD). The system is designed to assist in austere scenarios: a stabilized first-person view of the operating field is sent to a remote expert, who creates surgical instructions that a local first responder wearing the ARHMD can visualize as three-dimensional models projected onto the patient’s body. Our hypothesis evaluated whether remote guidance with STAR could lead to performing a surgical procedure better, as opposed to remote audio-only guidance. Remote expert surgeons guided first responders through training cricothyroidotomies in a simulated austere scenario, and on-site surgeons evaluated the participants using standardized evaluation tools. The evaluation comprehended completion time and technique performance of specific cricothyroidotomy steps. The analyses were also performed considering the participants’ years of experience as first responders, and their experience performing cricothyroidotomies. A linear mixed model analysis showed that using STAR was associated with higher procedural and non-procedural scores, and overall better performance. Additionally, a binary logistic regression analysis showed that using STAR was associated to safer and more successful executions of cricothyroidotomies. This work demonstrates that remote mentors can use STAR to provide first responders with guidance and surgical knowledge, and represents a first step towards the adoption of ARHMDs to convey clinical expertise remotely in austere scenarios.},

abstract={BACKGROUND The potential for disasters has required health care and public health systems to identify and refine their disaster emergency preparedness protocols and constantly improve the quality of health‐care provider disaster education and training. 1–3 Adequate disaster preparedness suffers from limited access to disaster training opportunities and costly and logistically challenging live disaster drills. 3 Alternatively, the increased use of technology in health care has increased patient education and expectations and the implementation of innovative modalities for health care education. 4 Simulation technology helps participants acquire, develop, and maintain the knowledge and skills necessary for safe and effective patient care. 5 High‐fidelity simulation (HFS) is particularly adept at providing a high‐quality environment for developing nontechnical management skills including communication, teamwork, leadership, and decision making, which are necessary when practicing a response to disaster situations. 4 Simulation fidelity is the similarity to reality achieved by the simulator. The following data were extracted using a custom tool: first author and year, data type (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed method), disaster type, disaster setting (country), World Bank status, 7 disaster phase, responders involved, type of HFS technology, problems encountered, findings and significance, and additional comments. Because the primary focus was to characterize the contexts wherein HFS technologies were used rather than methodologic quality, quality assessment metrics were not used in our inclusion/exclusion criteria.

abstract={The increase in the adoption of wearable fitness trackers has led to their inclusion as valuable evidence used by law enforcement during investigations. The information available in these fitness trackers can be used by law enforcement to prosecute or exonerate an individual. Wearable fitness devices are constantly being released by companies, with new firmware created for each iteration. As technology developers, research and law enforcement must keep pace to take advantage of data that can be used in investigations. The Fitbit line of devices is a popular brand of wearable trackers. This study will investigate what artifacts are generated by the new Fitbit Versa 2 by investigating what data are generated and stored on the smartphone app component of the new device. The artifacts discovered will be related to areas of forensic interest that are relevant to a law enforcement officer or digital forensics practitioner. Previous research and their methodologies used for application and mobile forensics will be used to conduct this research. This study finds the Fitbit Versa 2, and by extension, the Fitbit smartphone application does not store social media message notifications pushed to the tracker by the user’s mobile device. Some credit card information, health-related data, such as heart rate, GPS locations, and other potentially identifying data were found in plaintext. While the exposed data is not enough on its own to pose an immediate serious issue, it can be used as leverage to phish a user for further details.},

abstract={Recently, the healthcare technologies continue to develop rapidly, especially various wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices for body network have been invented one after another. The relevant products can already be easily purchased in the market such as the smart bracelet, smart blood pressure monitor and so on. These healthcare devices not only make users able to understand their own body information more in more detail but also provide a communication way to the hospital. It means that patients can obtain the professional medical prescription advice without going to the hospital in person because the health information can transmit to the medical cloud through any network interfaces. Additionally, both medical records of patients and prescription advice from doctors are stored in the cloud. In order to provide the better service quality, the use of fog in the network edge can quickly response the requests from the patients. The computing power of the fog node is less than the cloud. Therefore, balancing the trade-off between cloud and fog is very important. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem about offloading then use the metaheuristic to find out the best policy. Moreover, we also design an emergency supporting measure. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can provide a more efficient healthcare service.},

abstract={PurposeLaw enforcement officers (LEOs) suffer from premature mortality, intentional and unintentional injury, suicide and are at an increased risk for several non-communicable disease outcomes including cardiovascular disease and several cancers, compared to those employed in other occupations. Repeated exposure to stressful and traumatic stimuli is a possible mechanism driving these adverse health outcomes among LEOs. To better identify the sources of these health problems, the purpose of this paper is to determine the feasibility of conducting a cohort study using physiological measures of stress (e.g. heart rate) with LEOs; perceptions of the FitBit device, including LEO buy-in and attitudes associated with the protocol.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from ten recent graduates of the Dallas Police Training Academy.FindingsResults suggest that officer buy-in and protocol compliance was high. Officers were eager to participate in this study, and completion of weekly surveys was 100 percent. Minute-level missing data from wearable devices was relatively low (25 percent), and 90 percent of participants wore the FitBit devices on more than 90 percent of study days.Originality/valueResults from this study suggest that wearable physiological devices can be effectively used in law enforcement populations to measure stress.},

abstract={Background:Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals face high physical demands in high-stress settings; however, the prevalence of cardiovascular health (CVH) risk factors in this health care workforce has not been explored. The primary objective of this study was to compare the distribution of CVH and its individual components between a sample of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. The secondary objective was to identify associations between demographic and employment characteristics with ideal CVH in EMS professionals.Methods:A cross-sectional survey based on the American Heart Association’s (AHA; Dallas, Texas USA) Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) was administered to nationally-certified EMTs and paramedics. The LS7 components were scored according to previously described cut points (ideal = 2; intermediate = 1; poor = 0). A composite CVH score (0-10) was calculated from the component scores, excluding cholesterol and blood glucose due to missing data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR; 95% CI) for demographic and employment characteristics associated with optimal CVH (≥7 points).Results:There were 24,708 respondents that were currently practicing and included. More EMTs achieved optimal CVH (n = 4,889; 48.8%) compared to paramedics (n = 4,338; 40.6%). Factors associated with higher odds of optimal CVH included: higher education level (eg, college graduate or more: OR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.97-2.59); higher personal income (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.37); and working in an urban versus rural area (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.23-1.40). Paramedic certification level (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91), older age (eg, 50 years or older: OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.73), male sex (OR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.50-0.56), working for a non-fire-based agency (eg, private service: OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62-0.74), and providing medical transport service (OR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.94) were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH.Conclusions:Several EMS-related characteristics were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH. Future studies should focus on better understanding the CVH and metabolic risk profiles for EMS professionals and their association with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), major cardiac events, and occupational mortality.Cash RE, Crowe RP, Bower JK, Foraker RE, Panchal AR.

abstract={"Technology - Born from Human Nature" is a familiar Taiwan advertising slogan. Healthcare is a profession that is intimately entwined with human nature. In order to keep up with today's fast-changing healthcare environment and the broadly diverse needs of different healthcare settings, how to best use technology to creatively and efficiently develop patient-friendly care services and interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategies is a topic that is now receiving significant and growing attention in this field. The increasing utili- zation of big data worldwide is allowing us to better understand public needs and to more-accurately predict changing trends. Related technologies apply knowledge from the field of AI learning, as this process requires deep understanding of how target populations think and reason. This technology has the capacity to significantly improve the accuracy of healthcare diagnoses and to better anticipate patient safety risks in terms of prescription medicine use, the reporting of critical test results, and other factors, thus generating savings in terms of time and costs (Cheong, 2018). Furthermore, healthcare education is increasingly emphasizing the use of simulated environments in order to improve scenario-based learning and teaching efficacy. Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) applications help educators overcome the limitations of traditional models of education (Hsieh & Lin, 2017). Educators are now able to incorporate simulations of situations that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to experience otherwise, such as disaster scenes, inflight medical emergencies, surgeries, emergency rescue scenarios, and gender-care scenarios, into integrated innovative-technology education strategies. Moreover, related technology applications are assisting healthcare professionals to improve their familiarity with clinical techniques, outreach and communication skills, and training. Moreover, whether applied in healthcare education and training, clinical caregiving, emergency medical units, or chronic care settings, these simulation-related, cross-disciplinary technology applications have much to contribute.},

abstract={Due to hot toxic smoke and unknown risks under fire conditions, detection and relevant reconnaissance are significant in avoiding casualties. A fire reconnaissance robot was therefore developed to assist in the problem by offering important fire information to fire fighters. The robot consists of three main systems, a display operating system, video surveillance, and mapping and positioning navigation. Augmented reality (AR) goggle technology with a display operating system was also developed to free fire fighters’ hands, which enables them to focus on rescuing processes and not system operation. Considering smoke disturbance, a thermal imaging video surveillance system was included to extract information from the complicated fire conditions. Meanwhile, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology was adopted to build the map, together with the help of a mapping and positioning navigation system. This can provide a real-time map under the rapidly changing fire conditions to guide the fire fighters to the fire sources or the trapped occupants. Based on our experiments, it was found that all the tested system components work quite well under the fire conditions, while the video surveillance system produces clear images under dense smoke and a high-temperature environment; SLAM shows a high accuracy with an average error of less than 3.43%; the positioning accuracy error is 0.31 m; and the maximum error for the navigation system is 3.48%. The developed fire reconnaissance robot can provide a practically important platform to improve fire rescue efficiency to reduce the fire casualties of fire fighters.},

abstract={Introduction: Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using telesimulation to deliver an emergency medical services (EMS) course on mass casualty incident (MCI) training to healthcare providers overseas. Methods: We conducted a feasibility study to establish the process for successful delivery of educational content to learners overseas via telesimulation over a five-month period. Participants were registrants in an EMS course on MCI triage broadcast from University of California, Irvine Medical Simulation Center. The intervention was a Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) course. The primary outcome was successful implementation of the course via telesimulation. The secondary outcome was an assessment of participant thoughts, feelings, and attitudes via a qualitative survey. We also sought to obtain quantitative data that would allow for the assessment of triage accuracy. Descriptive statistics were used to express the percentage of participants with favorable responses to survey questions. Results: All 32 participants enrolled in the course provided a favorable response to all questions on the survey regarding their thoughts, feelings, and attitudes toward learning via telesimulation with wearable/mobile technology. Key barriers and challenges identified included dependability of Internet connection, choosing appropriate software platforms to deliver content, and intercontinental time difference considerations. The protocol detailed in this study demonstrated the successful implementation and feasibility of providing education and training to learners at an off-site location. Conclusion: In this feasibility study, we were able to demonstrate the successful implementation of an intercontinental MCI triage course using telesimulation and wearable/mobile technology. Healthcare providers expressed a positive favorability toward learning MCI triage via telesimulation. We were also able to establish a process to obtain quantitative data that would allow for the calculation of triage accuracy for further experimental study designs.},

abstract={Researchers have identified lifestyle diseases as a major threat to human civilization. These diseases gradually progress without giving any warning and result in a sudden health aggravation that leads to a medical emergency. As such, individuals can only avoid the life-threatening condition if they regularly monitor their health status. Health recommendation systems allow users to continuously monitor their health and deliver proper health advice to them. Also, continuous health monitoring depends on the real-time data exchange between health solution providers and users. In this regard, healthcare providers have begun to use wearable devices and recommendation systems to collect data in real time and to manage health conditions based on the generated data. However, we lack literature that has examined how individuals use wearable devices, what type of data the devices collect, and how providers use the data for delivering solutions to users. Thus, we decided to explore the available literature in this domain to understand how wearable devices can provide solutions to consumers. We also extended our focus to cover current health service delivery frameworks with the help of recommender systems. Thus, this study reviews health-monitoring services by conglomerating both wearable device and recommendation system to come up with personalized health and fitness solutions. Additionally, the paper elucidates key components of an advanced-level real-time monitoring service framework to guide future research and practice in this domain.},

abstract={Since 9/11, the fire service has experienced a shift and an expansion in the nature of threats and hazards that it faces. Despite advances in the field, firefighters are still losing their lives inside of burning buildings, and they must find new ways of identifying training gaps and improving current training practices. This thesis explores whether emergency incidents connected to low frequency and high risk events contain sufficient warning signs or indicators of imminent catastrophic events, if firefighters could identify them, and if there was a potential of changing decision making and averting a tragedy. In order to create a firm basis for this discovery, this research effort included a detailed analysis of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s line of duty death reports from the years 2013– 2015. The work provided an opportunity to learn from past events and practices and identify successes and failures in the firefighting domain without the bias of being closely involved with the cases or having a specific agenda. Quantitative analysis performed on this data set and the knowledge gleaned from looking at the events after the fact provide a foundation for advising novel training approaches and scenarios that can be used to train both individuals and teams of fire fighters.

abstract={The UK Defence Medical Service's Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) capability includes rapid-deployment Medical Emergency Response Teams (MERTs) comprising tri-service trauma consultants, paramedics and specialised nurses, all of whom are qualified to administer emergency care under extreme conditions to improve the survival prospects of combat casualties. The pre-deployment training of MERT personnel is designed to foster individual knowledge, skills and abilities in PHEC and in small team performance and cohesion in 'mission-specific' contexts. Until now, the provision of airborne pre-deployment MERT training had been dependent on either the availability of an operational aircraft (eg, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter) or access to one of only two ground-based facsimiles of the Chinook's rear cargo/passenger cabin. Although MERT training has high priority, there will always be competition with other military taskings for access to helicopter assets (and for other platforms in other branches of the Armed Forces). This paper describes the development of an inexpensive, reconfigurable and transportable MERT training concept based on 'mixed reality' technologies-in effect the 'blending' of real-world objects of training relevance with virtual reality reconstructions of operational contexts.},

abstract={Introduction The staffing of ambulances with different levels of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers is a difficult decision with evidence being mixed on the benefit of each model. Hypothesis/Problem The objective of this study was to describe a pilot program evaluating alternative staffing on two ambulances utilizing the paramedic-basic (PB) model (staffed with one paramedic and one emergency medical technicianEMT]). Methods This was a retrospective study conducted from September 17, 2013 through December 31, 2013. The PB ambulances were compared to geographically matched ambulances staffed with paramedic-paramedic (PP ambulances). One PP and one PB ambulance were based at Station A; one PP and one PB ambulance were based at Station B. The primary outcome was total on-scene time. Secondary outcomes included time-to-electrocardiogram (EKG), time-to-intravenous (IV) line insertion, IV-line success rate, and percentage of protocol violations. Inclusion criteria were all patients requesting prehospital services that were attended to by these teams. Patients were excluded if they were not attended to by the study ambulance vehicles. Descriptive statistics were reported as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Proportions were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Mann-Whitley U test was used for significance testing (P<.05). Results Median on-scene times at Station A for the PP ambulance were shorter than the PB ambulance team (PP: 10.1 minutes, IQR 6.0-15; PB: 13.0 minutes, IQR 8.1-18; P=.01). This finding also was noted at Station B (PP: 13.5 minutes, IQR 8.5-19; PB: 14.3 minutes, IQR 9.9-20; P=.01). There were no differences between PP and PB ambulance teams at Station A or Station B in time-to-EKG, time-to-IV insertion, IV success rate, and protocol violation rates. Conclusion In the setting of a well-developed EMS system utilizing an all-Advanced Life Support (ALS) response, this study suggests that PB ambulance teams may function well when compared to PP ambulances. Though longer scene times were observed, differences in time to ALS interventions and protocol violation rates were not different. Hybrid ambulance teams may be an effective staffing alternative, but decisions to use this model must address clinical and operational concerns. Cortez EJ , Panchal AR , Davis JE , Keseg DP .

abstract={Introduction Research suggests Emergency Medical Services (EMS) over-use in urban cities is partly due to substance users with limited access to medical/social services. Recent efforts to deliver brief, motivational messages to encourage these individuals to enter treatment have not considered EMS providers. Problem Little research has been done with EMS providers who serve substance-using patients. The EMS providers were interviewed about participating in a pilot program where they would be trained to screen their patients for substance abuse and encourage them to enter drug treatment. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD; Baltimore, Maryland USA) EMS providers (N=22). Topics included EMS misuse, work demands, and views on participating in the pilot program. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory and constant-comparison. Results Participants were mostly white (68.1%); male (68.2%); with Advanced Life Skills training (90.9%). Mean age was 37.5 years. Providers described the "frequent flyer problem" (eg, EMS over-use by a few repeat non-emergent cases). Providers expressed disappointment with local health delivery due to resource limitations and being excluded from decision making within their administration, leading to reduced team morale and burnout. Nonetheless, providers acknowledged they are well-positioned to intervene with substance-using patients because they are in direct contact and have built rapport with them. They noted patients might be most receptive to motivational messages immediately after overdose revival, which several called "hitting their bottom." Several stated that involvement with the proposed study would be facilitated by direct incorporation into EMS providers' current workflow. Many recommended that research team members accompany EMS providers while on-call to observe their day-to-day work. Barriers identified by the providers included time constraints to intervene, limited knowledge of substance abuse treatment modalities, and fearing negative repercussions from supervisors and/or patients. Despite reservations, several EMS providers expressed inclination to deliver brief motivational messages to encourage substance-using patients to consider treatment, given adequate training and skill-building. Conclusions Emergency Medical Service providers may have many demands, including difficult case time/resource limitations. Even so, participants recognized their unique position as first responders to deliver motivational, harm-reduction messages to substance-using patients during transport. With incentivized training, implementing this program could be life- and cost-saving, improving emergency and behavioral health services. Findings will inform future efforts to connect substance users with drug treatment, potentially reducing EMS over-use in Baltimore. Maragh-Bass AC , Fields JC , McWilliams J , Knowlton AR .

abstract={Traditionally, rural areas in many countries are limited by a lack of access to health care due to the inherent challenges associated with recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals. Telemedicine, which uses communication technology to deliver medical services over distance, is an economical and potentially effective way to address this problem. In this research, we develop a new telepresence application using an Augmented Reality (AR) system. We explore the use of the Microsoft HoloLens to facilitate and enhance remote medical training. Intrinsic advantages of AR systems enable remote learners to perform complex medical procedures such as Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) without visual interference. This research uses the HoloLens to capture the first-person view of a simulated rural emergency room (ER) through mixed reality capture (MRC) and serves as a novel telemedicine platform with remote pointing capabilities. The mentor’s hand gestures are captured using a Leap Motion and virtually displayed in the AR space of the HoloLens. To explore the feasibility of the developed platform, twelve novice medical trainees were guided by a mentor through a simulated ultrasound exploration in a trauma scenario, as part of a pilot user study. The study explores the utility of the system from the trainees, mentor, and objective observers’ perspectives and compares the findings to that of a more traditional multi-camera telemedicine solution. The results obtained provide valuable insight and guidance for the development of an AR-supported telemedicine platform.},

abstract={This paper aims to elicit insights about sustainable wearables by investigating recent advancements in wearable technology and their applications. Wearable technology has advanced considerably from a technical perspective, but it has stagnated due to barriers without penetrating wider society despite early positive expectations. This situation is the motivation behind the focus on studies by many research groups in recent years into wearable applications that can provide the best value from a human-oriented perspective. The expectation is that a new means to resolve the issue can be found from a viewpoint of sustainability; this is the main point of this paper. This paper first focuses on the trend of wearable technology like bodily status monitoring, multi-wearable device control, and smart networking between wearable sensors. Second, the development intention of such technology is investigated. Finally, this paper discusses about the applications of current wearable technology from the sustainable perspective, rather than detailed description of the component technologies employed in wearables. In this paper, the definition of sustainable wearables is discussed in the context of improving the quality of individual life, social impact, and social public interest; those wearable applications include the areas of wellness, healthcare, assistance for the visually impaired, disaster relief, and public safety. In the future, wearables will not be simple data trackers or fun accessories but will gain extended objectives and meanings that play a valuable role for individuals and societies. Successful and sustainable wearables will lead to positive changes for both individuals and societies overall.},

abstract={Physiological parameter monitoring may be useful in many different groups of the population, such as infants, elderly people, athletes, soldiers, drivers, fire-fighters, police etc. This can provide a variety of information ranging from health status to operational readiness. In this article, we focus on the case of first responders and specifically fire-fighters. Firefighters can benefit from a physiological monitoring system that is used to extract multiple indications such as the present position, the possible life risk level, the stress level etc. This work presents a wearable wireless sensor network node, based on low cost, commercial-off- the-self (COTS) electronic modules, which can be easily attached on a standard fire-fighters’ uniform. Due to the low frequency wired interface between the selected electronic components, the proposed solution can be used as a basis for a textile system where all wired connections will be implemented by means of conductive yarn routing in the textile structure, while some of the standard sensors can be replaced by textile ones. System architecture is described in detail, while indicative samples of acquired signals are also presented.},

abstract={Objective The diagnosis of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) should be reserved for infants with a pathogenic androgen receptor gene (AR ) mutation. However, only about 20% of infants with a clinical phenotype akin to PAIS have an AR mutation. We aimed to identify clinical features associated with the presence of an AR mutation. Methods The external masculinisation score (EMS; normal=12), birth weight (BW), gestational age and BW SD score (BW-SDS) of 164 infants with a 'PAIS-like' phenotype were analysed in the Cambridge Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) Database, of whom 128 (78%) had no AR mutation ('AR mutation-negative') and 36 (22%) had an AR mutation ('AR mutation-positive'). Results The EMS was similar in AR mutation-negative and AR mutation-positive infants (median, IQR: 5.0, 3.0 to 6.0 vs 4.8, 3.0 to 6.0; p=0.33). AR mutation-negative infants had lower BW (2.33, 1.38 to 3.20 vs 3.18, 2.87 to 3.61 kg; p<0.001), lower gestational age (37.0, 34.0 to 40.0 vs 40.0, 39.0 to 40.0 weeks; p<0.001), and lower BW-SDS (-1.31, -2.33 to -0.46 vs -0.57, -1.19 to 0.33; p=0.001) compared to AR mutation-positive infants. More AR mutation-negative infants (47/128; 37%) than AR mutation-positive infants (2/36; 6%) had BW-SDS <-2 (p<0.001). Conclusions The severity of genital anomalies in this large cohort of infants with a 'PAIS-like' phenotype did not differentiate their AR status. Almost all the infants born small-for-gestational-age do not have an AR mutation. A category of 'XY DSD and fetal growth restriction, as yet unexplained' should be recognised.},

abstract={Background and Objectives: Ticagrelor, the first reversibly binding oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist, improves outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) compared with clopidogrel. In the ONSET-OFFSET study (parallel group trial) and the RESPOND study (crossover trial), the pharmacodynamic effects of ticagrelor were compared with clopidogrel in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We now report the pharmacokinetic analyses of ticagrelor, and the exposure-inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) relationships from these studies. Patients and Methods: Patients were treated with ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily maintenance dose) or clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose, 75 mg once daily maintenance dose) in addition to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 75-100 mg once daily]. Ticagrelor administration was for 6 weeks in ONSET-OFFSET. In RESPOND, ticagrelor was given for 14 days before or after 2 weeks of clopidogrel in patients classified as clopidogrel responders or non-responders. Pharmacokinetics and IPA were evaluated following the loading and last maintenance doses. Exposure-IPA relationships were evaluated using a sigmoid maximum effect (E max) model. Outcome Measures: The outcome measures were ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX (active metabolite) pharmacokinetics and exposure-IPA relationships in both trials, including the effect of prior clopidogrel exposure, and effects in clopidogrel responders and non-responders in RESPOND. Results: In ONSET-OFFSET, maximum (peak) plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 8 hours (AUC8) for ticagrelor were 733 ng/mL, 2.0 hours and 4130 ng · h/mL, respectively; and for AR-C124910XX were 210 ng/mL, 2.1 hours and 1325 ng · h/mL, respectively. Emax estimates were IPA >97%. Trough plasma ticagrelor (305 ng/mL) and AR-C124910XX (121 ng/mL) concentrations were 5.2 and 7.7 times higher than respective concentration producing 50% of maximum effect (EC50) estimates. In RESPOND, ticagrelor mean Cmax and AUC8 following 2-week dosing were comparable between clopidogrel responders (724 ng/mL and 3983 ng · h/mL, respectively) and non-responders (764 ng/mL and 3986 ng · h/mL, respectively). Pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor were unaffected by prior clopidogrel dosing. E max estimates were IPA >96% for both responders and non-responders. Trough plasma concentrations were sufficient to achieve high IPA. Conclusions: Ticagrelor pharmacokinetics in stable CAD patients were comparable to previous findings in stable atherosclerotic and ACS patients, and were not affected by prior clopidogrel exposure or clopidogrel responsiveness. Ticagrelor effectively inhibited platelet aggregation, and trough plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were sufficient to result in high IPA in stable CAD patients.

abstract={A custom head-mounted display (HMD) integrated into a firefighter's facemask was evaluated for its ability to aid in navigating through large buildings in low-visibility conditions. The HMD was a monocular occluded design with a colour 640 × 480 pixel LCD mounted low in one's field of view. It showed the subject their real-time location on a floor plan. Subject location was found with an 802.15.4 wireless sensor network by using the received signal strength indicator localization method. The study consisted of two different courses of similar difficulty in different buildings in the campus of theUniversity of California, Berkeley. Therewere 21 subjects, of which eight of them were firefighters and five of them were female. The subjects completed the courses in the same order, but alternated in treatment condition. Subjects with the HMD returned on average a 38 per cent faster course completion time, a 44 per cent shorter distance travelled, 60 per cent fewer navigation errors, and 60 per cent more accurate map marking. A follow-up questionnaire showed a strong preference for use of the HMD in navigation tasks, and unanimous approval of the occluded optical design and low mounting location. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We use a portable patient unit (PPU) and a wearable shirt (WS) to monitor electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration (acquired with respiratory inductive plethysmography, RIP), and activity. Owing to integrating fabric sensors and electrodes endowed with electro-physical properties into the WS, long-term continuous monitoring can be realized without making patients feel uncomfortable and restricting their mobility. The PPU analyzes physiological signals in real time and determines whether the patient is in danger or needs external help. The PPU will alert the patient and an emergency call will be automatically established with a medical service center (MSC) when life-threatening arrhythmias or falls are detected. With advanced gpsOne technology, the patient can be located and rescued immediately whether he/she is indoors or outdoors in case of emergency.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Background: Multisensor fitness trackers offer the ability to longitudinally estimate sleep quality in a home environment with the potential to outperform traditional actigraphy. To benefit from these new tools for objectively assessing sleep for clinical and research purposes, multisensor wearable devices require careful validation against the gold standard of sleep polysomnography (PSG). Naturalistic studies favor validation. Objective: This study aims to validate the Fitbit Charge 2 against portable home PSG in a shift-work population composed of 59 first responder police officers and paramedics undergoing shift work. Methods: A reliable comparison between the two measurements was ensured through the data-driven alignment of a PSG and Fitbit time series that was recorded at night. Epoch-by-epoch analyses and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, the Matthews correlation coefficient, bias, and limits of agreement. Results: Sleep onset and offset, total sleep time, and the durations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non–rapid-eye movement sleep stages N1+N2 and N3 displayed unbiased estimates with nonnegligible limits of agreement. In contrast, the proprietary Fitbit algorithm overestimated REM sleep latency by 29.4 minutes and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) by 37.1 minutes. Epoch-by-epoch analyses indicated better specificity than sensitivity, with higher accuracies for WASO (0.82) and REM sleep (0.86) than those for N1+N2 (0.55) and N3 (0.78) sleep. Fitbit heart rate (HR) displayed a small underestimation of 0.9 beats per minute (bpm) and a limited capability to capture sudden HR changes because of the lower time resolution compared to that of PSG. The underestimation was smaller in N2, N3, and REM sleep (0.6-0.7 bpm) than in N1 sleep (1.2 bpm) and wakefulness (1.9 bpm), indicating a state-specific bias. Finally, Fitbit suggested a distribution of all sleep episode durations that was different from that derived from PSG and showed nonbiological discontinuities, indicating the potential limitations of the staging algorithm. Conclusions: We conclude that by following careful data processing processes, the Fitbit Charge 2 can provide reasonably accurate mean values of sleep and HR estimates in shift workers under naturalistic conditions. Nevertheless, the generally wide limits of agreement hamper the precision of quantifying individual sleep episodes. The value of this consumer-grade multisensor wearable in terms of tackling clinical and research questions could be enhanced with open-source algorithms, raw data access, and the ability to blind participants to their own sleep data.},

abstract={Clinical activities to do with non-life-threatening disease were deemed nonessential to controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. Nursing and paramedical staff were dispatched to acute care settings, and patient visits in most of the sectors that manage chronic conditions were suspended. Despite the initial difficulties of setting up telecommunications so that I, a physician specializing in headache medicine, could provide health care services remotely, most of my patients were grateful for the option of telehealth; it became a means for them to safely maintain medical contact with me. However, I also realized this new model of care was not in the best interests of all my patients. There is widespread concern about the detrimental effects of confinement in vulnerable patient populations that lack social network support groups.Footnote 1 In particular, victims of domestic abuse have reported increased risk of violence.Footnote 2 Because I care for patients who are not only predominantly female but also have an innate brain hypersensitivity to aversive stimuli, I am often entrusted with sensitive information about headache triggers, such as emotional distress caused by conjugal violence.Footnote 3 The COVID-19 pandemic contingency directives did not authorize in-person medical visits for victims of intimate-partner violence (IPV). In-person medical visits have been limited to physical examinations in the case of an acutely fatal condition, such as a thunderclap headache suggestive of an intracranial bleed, or hardware malfunctions of technology-based therapeutic devices, for example, parenteral drug delivery systems and implantable nerve signalling modulators.Footnote 4Footnote 5 Fortunately for these patients, my hospital’s institutional authorities were receptive to my request to maintain in-person medical visits, regardless of their headache status. Of course, these patients are screened for COVID-19 infection 24 hours or less prior to the appointment, and safety measures such as hand hygiene, mask wearing and physical distancing are mandatory. A non-urgent or non-life-threatening service does not equate to a nonessential service. For victims of IPV, accessing health care involves challenges related to cost, fear of facing prejudice and discrimination, the controlling tactics of abusive partners and a low sense of self-efficacy.Footnote 6Footnote 7Footnote 8 Contingency regulations necessary to control the pandemic have further increased vulnerability to IPV, through the crises created by job losses and displacement as well as social isolation caused by mandatory physical distancing. Despite a predicted rise in IPV incidents, emergency response support services have seen a decrease in the numbers of victims reaching out, likely a consequence of IPV victims’ concern at potentially exposing themselves and their loved ones to infection as well as being entrapped with their abuser.Footnote 9 The pandemic has also decreased access to safe havens. Most shelters are operating at reduced capacity, travel is restricted, public transportation has been reduced and curfews imposed.Footnote 10 Also, as the majority of health care centres no longer authorize walk-ins for consultations, victims may be threatened when booking an appointment online or by telephone in the presence of the perpetrator.Footnote 11 In addition, IPV victims who are from marginalized ethnic communities may have an enhanced sense of mistrust of law enforcement authorities as a result of police officers handing out financial sanctions for breaching confinement; such negative perceptions of the judiciary system often translate to distrust of medical institutions.Footnote 12Footnote 13 Sexual and reproductive health clinical activities are being maintained for victims of domestic abuse in order to screen for collateral damages caused by pandemic-related social isolation.Footnote 14 But victims of IPV whose access to their chronic health care provider is restricted may struggle to trust and seek help from unfamiliar health providers. Patients likely want to avoid hurried appointments and professionals’ lack of understanding in acute care settings, for example. Also, they may feel guilty about wasting critical services in emergency departments that are at capacity. They may also feel uneasy speaking about sensitive topics in an unfamiliar setting, especially if they are on a hallway stretcher or in a noisy emergency department with limited confidentiality. Chronic care physicians across all sectors should be encouraged to consider their services essential for patients at risk of violence by current confinement measures. Managing chronic health issues, often over several years, implies long-term follow-up that forges a therapeutic alliance with patients; this makes it more likely that patients reach out for help at times of crisis. Such alliances generally reflect the quality of communication between the patient and the health care provider, encompassing a personal relationship and collaborative work.Footnote 15 With the patient–physician relationship central to their role, family physicians often build such alliances with their patients through comprehensive coordination of care that extends beyond focus on the disease.Footnote 16Footnote 17 The patient–provider alliances that are unrelated to sexual or reproductive health include long-term management of endocrinopathies, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and respiratory or cardiac conditions, to name a few.Footnote 15 The proposed approach may be valuable in the context of an established relationship with a patient who has disclosed a history of violence and abuse. With health care reorganized during the pandemic, physicians aware of patients with a history of domestic violence should, as long as logistics permit, arrange at least one in-person visit. Although most physicians are likely to have discussed the topic of seeking help, such discussions are generally superficial and limited to encouraging the patient to seek community resources; many physicians are constrained by heavy workloads and lack the self-confidence to support these patients.Footnote 6 However, repeated interventions by a physician the patient trusts, in a safe environment, is enabling and favourably viewed by patients, while follow-up telephone calls are not.Footnote 18 This in-person visit is not meant to screen for IPV—the patient has previously disclosed this information—but to assess their chronic illness and to offer them an opportunity to be put in touch with IPV resources in the midst of an epidemic and psychosocial health crisis. Should the patient need a safety plan, the physician must recognize the limitations of their expertise in IPV and determine if other professionals need to be contacted. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions have implemented an on-call social crisis support team for health care workers who need guidance and expertise in assisting their patients. Examples of some practical tips and points to discuss with a victim of IPV during an in-person assessment can include the following: * For patients who are not tech-savvy or have restricted access to a computer, allocate time during the visit to tell them the locations of the shelters nearest to their home and the hospital as well as other resources such as a cultural community centre. Print out paper copies of the maps for the patient if necessary. Make sure that you give the patient current information about these resources and any pandemic-related operational/organisational changes. * In planning for the next follow-up, ask the patient when is the best time to call to find her alone to discuss health issues. * In those institutions where medical notes are still handwritten, make sure that the emergency plan discussed with the patient is electronically typed and legible for all health care professionals should the patient present to an emergency department. This will also reassure the patient that they will not have to provide lengthy explanations during triage, especially if accompanied by the aggressor. * Tell the patient the exact date and place in the chart where the emergency plan is filed. This can allow them to discreetly and rapidly refer a triage nurse to it. * Stay up-to-date with a list of cancelled or no-show appointments to ensure that these patients are not removed from the waiting list without your knowledge. Some institutions only permit a certain number of cancellations, failed attempts to reschedule or no-shows before automatically removing them. * Avoid describing patients as victims of IPV to your clerical staff. Many survivors avoid such a labelling, and as there are many reasons why patients would be seen in person, such as the need for a physical exam if a red flag presents during a telehealth interview (for example, transient vision loss accompanying headache in the field of neurology), there is no need to share the reason for a confidential visit with non-medical staff and personnel not involved in the patient’s care plan. Following this in-person visit, the physician can decide on the frequency of and way to maintain medical contact, but if the patient’s reason for contact is related to domestic abuse, efforts should be made to put the patient in contact with IPV experts who can best make the argument on delivery of care. If the patient and physician prefer to continue care through telehealth, the physician could send the patient a letter with a tentative post-pandemic in-person appointment date. The patient could place this letter in sight, to serve as a reminder to all household members that they are cared for by a health professional who expects to assess their well-being and examine them after the pandemic. To quote Mechanic and Schlesinger,Footnote 19 “the success of medical care depends most importantly on patients’ trust that their physicians …] give their patients’ welfare the highest priority.” As it will likely take some time for public health authorities to put in place initiatives aimed at reducing the gendered impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must ensure that our vulnerable patient populations are not neglected.Footnote 20 Despite the ethical challenges posed by COVID-19 contingency measures balancing public safety and patient-centred care, we must recognize situations where we need to advocate for our patients, especially for those who do not or cannot advocate adequately for themselves. As health care providers, we must share our front-line perspective with public health authorities, such as important factors that might affect the decision about offering in-person visits during the current pandemic. These factors often go beyond the usual practical issues of how much a physical exam might be needed or how easily the patient can access the requisite technology for virtual care. In this article I highlight the importance of maintaining medical contact, including in-person visits when possible, for victims of IPV who have previously disclosed domestic abuse. This is particularly valuable if we have built a therapeutic alliance with the patient, through long-term management of a chronic health condition, for example. Although the perspective of this article is through the practice of headache medicine, these issues can apply broadly, irrespective of the clinic’s specialty, its patients’ sex-ratio and its staffing shortage due to COVID-19 redeployment. Physicians in sectors nonessential to the COVID-19 direct response and who have seen a change in their usual clinical activities should consider maintaining their services as essential care for these patients. As many community social crisis services are seeing drastic increases in wait times, it is important that we remain flexible towards our patients. Moreover, the patient’s primary care physician should be involved in the care plan if the patient consents. It is not unusual, however, for a clinician involved in the care of a chronic condition, particularly for complex tertiary level medical illnesses, to have a stronger therapeutic alliance with the patient because of more frequent medical contact. Finally, as public health authorities aim to improve the reorganization of health care during the global pandemic, physicians are encouraged to collaborate with other institutional specialized teams when limited by their own expertise, in particular with psychosocial staff in assisting marginalized and vulnerable populations. This can be especially useful for victims of IPV, where a well-thought-out safety plan takes into account the complex dynamics of living in an abusive situation that goes beyond the experience of violence.

abstract={Key fndings include: (1) communities appear to follow VI-SPDAT scoring guidelines to match individuals to housing interventions based on level of vulnerability; (2) most single adults served by coordinated entry systems who exit homelessness remain out of the homeless services system for at least 365 days; (3) individuals whose VI-SPDAT score was 8 or higher (making them eligible for PSH) but who were ultimately placed in RRH returned to homelessness at rates three times higher than their counterparts exiting to PSH; (4) returning to homelessness is positively correlated with VI-SPDAT scores regardless of housing type, suggesting that individuals with high vulnerability scores face an overall higher risk of returning to homelessness; (5) disparities in housing outcomes observed among indigenous populations signal the need for more culturally inclusive studies of marginalized groups served by coordinated entry; and (6) planning personal activities beyond survival may decrease an individual's odds of returning to homelessness while trauma or abuse survivors face a greater risk of experiencing recurrent homelessness. Literature Review Coordinated Entry Systems As rises in homelessness continue to outpace investments in permanent and affordable housing, CoCs struggle to resolve the housing crises facing their communities. Since 2014, the population of single adults experiencing homelessness has increased by 10 percent, and their rate of chronic homelessness-defined as long-term homelessness coupled with a chronic health condition-has increased by 14.5 percent (HUD, 2019a). Unable to meet the housing needs of all persons experiencing homelessness, communities must determine how to fairly and equitably allocate limited resources. Since 2012, HUD has required each CoC to implement coordinated entry by standardizing assessment practices and prioritizing the most vulnerable persons to receive available housing resources. Based on research conducted among individuals accessing services through Boston Health Care for the Homeless (Hwang et al., 1997), risk criteria measured by the VI include age; the number of hospitalizations or emergency room visits; HIV/AIDS status; liver or kidney disease; a history of either frostbite, immersion foot, or hypothermia; and co-occurring behavioral health and chronic medical conditions (Cronley et al., 2013).},

abstract={Firefighters need to gain information from both inside and outside of buildings in first response emergency scenarios. For this purpose, drones are beneficial. This paper presents an elicitation study that showed firefighters’ desires to collaborate with autonomous drones. We developed a Human–Drone interaction (HDI) method for indicating a target to a drone using 3D pointing gestures estimated solely from a monocular camera. The participant first points to a window without using any wearable or body-attached device. Through the drone’s front-facing camera, the drone detects the gesture and computes the target window. This work includes a description of the process for choosing the gesture, detecting and localizing objects, and carrying out the transformations between coordinate systems. Our proposed 3D pointing gesture interface improves on 2D interfaces by integrating depth information with SLAM and solving ambiguity with multiple objects aligned on the same plane in a large-scale outdoor environment. Experimental results showed that our 3D pointing gesture interface obtained average F1 scores of 0.85 and 0.73 for precision and recall in simulation and real-world experiments and an F1 score of 0.58 at the maximum distance of 25 m between the drone and building.},

abstract={BackgroundAndrogen deprivation therapies for the hormone-dependent stages of prostate cancer have become so effective that new forms of chemoresistant tumors are emerging in clinical practice, and require new targeted therapies in the metastatic setting. Yet there are important gaps in our understanding of the relevant transcriptional networks driving this process. Progression from localized to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) occurs as a result of accumulated resistance mechanisms that develop upon sustained androgen receptor (AR) suppression. Critical to this progression is the plastic nature by which prostate tumor cells transition from epithelial to mesenchymal states (EMT).MethodsHere, using prostate cancer cell lines with different AR composition, we systematically manipulated somatic proteins of the Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal (BET) family (BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4) to determine which BET proteins influence EMT. We used the TCGA repository to correlate the expression of individual BET genes with key EMT genes and determined biochemical recurrence in 414 patients and progression free survival in 488 patients.ResultsWe found that only BRD4—and not BRD2 or BRD3—regulates the expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2, and that the downregulation of these EMT transcription factors significantly increases E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, of the BET genes, only BRD4 correlates with survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients. Moreover, selective degradation of BRD4 protein with MZ1 ablates EMT (transcriptionally and morphologically) induced by TGFß signaling.ConclusionsMany relapsed/refractory tumors share a neuroendocrine transcriptional signature that had been relatively rare until highly successful antiandrogen drugs like abiraterone and enzalutamide came into widespread use. New therapeutic targets must therefore be developed. Our results identify key EMT genes regulated by BRD4, and offers a novel druggable target to treat mCRPC. BRD4-selective protein degraders offer a promising next generation approach to treat the emerging forms of chemoresistance in advanced prostate cancer.},

abstract={Estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) mutations occur frequently in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer, and confer clinical resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Expression of the ESR1 Y537S mutation induced an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) with cells exhibiting enhanced migration and invasion potential in vitro. When small subpopulations of Y537S ESR1 mutant cells were injected along with WT parental cells, tumor growth was enhanced with mutant cells becoming the predominant population in distant metastases. Y537S mutant primary xenograft tumors were resistant to the antiestrogen tamoxifen (Tam) as well as to estradiol (E2) withdrawal. Y537S ESR1 mutant primary tumors metastasized efficiently in the absence of E2; however, Tam treatment significantly inhibited metastasis to distant sites. We identified a nine-gene expression signature, which predicted clinical outcomes of ER-positive breast cancer patients, as well as breast cancer metastasis to the lung. Androgen receptor (AR) protein levels were increased in mutant models, and the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone significantly inhibited estrogen-regulated gene expression, EMT, and distant metastasis in vivo, suggesting that AR may play a role in distant metastatic progression of ESR1 mutant tumors.},

abstract={BackgroundPathogenic variants in the androgen receptor (AR) gene located on chromosome Xq11-12, are known to cause varying degrees of undermasculinization in 46, XY individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of pathogenic variants in the AR gene in a cohort of 46, XY undermasculinized individuals from Indonesia who were suspected of having androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). All patients with 46, XY DSD referred to our center between 1994 and 2019 were collected from our clinical database. All 46, XY DSD patients without a prior molecular diagnosis with an external masculinization score (EMS) ≤ 9 were included in this study. All exons and intron–exon boundaries of AR gene were analyzed using Sanger sequencing to identify pathogenic variants of the AR gene.ResultsA cohort of 75 undermasculinized patients were selected for the study. Direct Sanger sequencing of all eight exons of the AR gene led to a genetic diagnosis in 11 patients (14.67%). All of the variants identified (p.Arg841His; p.Ile604Asn; p.Val731Met; p.Pro672Ser; p.Gln739Arg; p.Ser302Glufs*3) have been previously reported in patients with AIS.ConclusionsThis is the first study in Indonesia that highlights the significance of molecular analysis in providing a definitive diagnosis of AIS for patients with 46, XY DSD undermasculinization. This is an uncommon finding in the Indonesian population presenting with 46, XY DSD undermasculinization. A genetic diagnosis allows optimal clinical management and genetic counseling for patients and their families. As 46, XY DSD can be caused by pathogenic variants in other genes involved in gonadal development and differentiation, further genetic analysis, such as whole exome sequencing, should be carried out on those patients that did not carry an AR variant.},

abstract={The rigidity of information technology (IT) has been hindering the development of various businesses regarding energy management systems (EMSs) of power networks, although this area has become more diversified, resulting in changes of elements in the systems due to the introduction of renewable energy (RE) and the new energy industry. In order to effectively accommodate these changes, EMSs should be developed in a structure with a standard-based interface, which can secure interoperability between components in the EMS. In previous studies, the common information model (CIM) proposed by IEC TC57 has been utilized for developing EMSs of power networks, but there are gaps between the existing CIM and an information model for the EMSs of carbon-free island microgrids (MGs), which are a newly introduced form of power network covering multiple islands for reducing carbon emissions. This paper proposes a CIM-based software platform for a carbon-free island MG-EMS to efficiently operate the power network and secure interoperability between components in the MG-EMS. Concerning service restoration of the power network, use cases and business objects representing information exchanged between the components in the EMS are derived, and the existing CIM is extended based on the results of the gap analysis in order to provide necessary information on the MG-EMS. The validity of the proposed platform is verified by exchanging payloads between components in the MG-EMS based on the profile extracted from the extended CIM. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed platform regarding data size and speed of data exchange is presented. Based on the case study results, it is concluded that the proposed platform based on the extended CIM can exchange data between the components in the MG-EMS, achieving reasonable data size and speed of data exchange with the help of the interoperability between components in the carbon-free island MG-EMS.},

abstract={The next future strategies for improved occupational safety and health management could largely benefit from wearable and Internet of Things technologies, enabling the real-time monitoring of health-related and environmental information to the wearer, to emergency responders, and to inspectors. The aim of this study is the development of a wearable gas sensor for the detection of NH3 at room temperature based on the organic semiconductor poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), electrochemically deposited iridium oxide particles, and a hydrogel film. The hydrogel composition was finely optimised to obtain self-healing properties, as well as the desired porosity, adhesion to the substrate, and stability in humidity variations. Its chemical structure and morphology were characterised by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively, and were found to play a key role in the transduction process and in the achievement of a reversible and selective response. The sensing properties rely on a potentiometric-like mechanism that significantly differs from most of the state-of-the-art NH3 gas sensors and provides superior robustness to the final device. Thanks to the reliability of the analytical response, the simple two-terminal configuration and the low power consumption, the PEDOT:PSS/IrOx Ps/hydrogel sensor was realised on a flexible plastic foil and successfully tested in a wearable configuration with wireless connectivity to a smartphone. The wearable sensor showed stability to mechanical deformations and good analytical performances, with a sensitivity of 60 ± 8 μA decade−1 in a wide concentration range (17–7899 ppm), which includes the safety limits set by law for NH3 exposure.},

abstract={Background Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) transmits its signal via two major Gα-proteins, primarily Gαq and Gαi. However, the precise mechanism underlying the functions of Gαs signal in prostate cancer cells is still unclear. We have previously identified that GV1001, a fragment of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase, functions as a biased GnRHR ligand to selectively stimulate the Gαs/cAMP pathway. Here, we tried to reveal the potential mechanisms of which GV1001-stimulated Gαs-cAMP signaling pathway reduces the migration and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Methods The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes was measured by western-blotting and spheroid formation on ultra-low attachment plate was detected after GV1001 treatment. In vivo Spleen-liver metastasis mouse model was used to explore the inhibitory effect of GV1001 on metastatic ability of PCa and the transwell migration assay was performed to identify whether GV1001 had a suppressive effect on cell migration in vitro. In order to demonstrate the interaction between androgen receptor (AR) and YAP1, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed in LNCaP cells with and without GV1001 treatment. Results GV1001 inhibited expression of EMT-related genes and spheroid formation. GV1001 also suppressed in vivo spleen-liver metastasis of LNCaP cells as well as cell migration in vitro. GV1001 enhanced the phosphorylation of AR and transcription activity of androgen response element reporter gene through cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Moreover, GV1001 increased Ser-127 phosphorylation of YAP1 and its ubiquitination, and subsequently decreased the levels of AR-YAP1 binding in the promoter region of the CTGF gene. In contrast, both protein and mRNA levels of NKX3.1 known for tumor suppressor gene and AR-coregulator were upregulated by GV1001 in LNCaP cells. YAP1 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 significantly suppressed the migration ability of LNCaP cells, and GV1001 did not affect the cell migration of YAP1-deficient LNCaP cells. On the contrary, cell migration was more potentiated in LNCaP cells overexpressing YAP5SA, a constitutively active form of YAP1, which was not changed by GV1001 treatment. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals an essential role of AR-YAP1 in the regulation of PCa cell migration, and provides evidence that GV1001 could be a novel GnRHR ligand to inhibit metastasis of PCa via the Gαs/cAMP pathway.},

abstract={Background: Patients with endometriosis (EMs) have high risks of infertility and spontaneous abortion. How to remodel the fertility of patients with EMs has always been the hot spot and difficulty in the field of reproductive medicine. As an aglycone of ginsenosides, protopanaxadiol (PPD) possesses pleiotropic biological functions and has high medicinal values. We aimed to investigate the effect and potential mechanism of PPD in the treatment of EMs-associated infertility and spontaneous abortion. Methods: The EMs mice models were constructed by allotransplantation. The pregnancy rates, embryo implantation numbers and embryo resorption rates of control and EMs were counted. RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and FCM analysis were performed to screen and confirm the expression of endometrial receptivity/decidualization-related molecules, inflammation cytokines and NK cell function-related molecules in vitro and/or in vivo. The SWISS Target Prediction, STRING and Cytoscape were carried out to predict the potential cellular sensory proteins, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network between sensory proteins and fertility-related molecules, respectively. Micro-CT detection, liver and kidney function tests were used to evaluate the safety. Results: Here, we observe that PPD significantly up-regulates endometrial receptivity-related molecules (e.g., Lif, Igfbp1, Mmps, collagens) and restricts pelvic inflammatory response (low levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ) of macrophage, and further remodel and improve the fertility of EMs mice. Additionally, PPD increases the expression of decidualization-related genes and Collagens, and promotes the proliferation, residence, immune tolerance and anagogic functions of decidual NK cells (low levels of CD16 and NKp30, high levels of Ki67, VEGF, TGF-β) in pregnant EMs mice, and further triggers decidualization, decidual NK cell-mediated maternal-fetal immune tolerance and angiogenesis, preventing pregnant EMs mice from miscarriage. Mechanically, these effects should be dependent on ESRs, PGR and other sensory proteins (e.g., AR). Compared with GnRHa (the clinic first-line drug for EMs), PPD does not lead to the decline of serum estrogen and bone loss. Conclusion: These data suggest that PPD prevents EMs-associated infertility and miscarriage in sex hormones receptors-dependent and independent manners possibly, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy with high efficiency and low side effects to remodels the fertility of patients with EMs.},

abstract={Aberrant expression of P68 RNA helicase (p68), a prototypical member of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases, contributes to tumor development and progression. P68 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF signaling facilitates cancer metastasis by promoting EMT. In this report, we show that p68 promotes breast cancer cell EMT and cell migration by upregulation of PDGF receptor β (PDGFR-β). Knockdown of p68 in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells significantly decreases PDGFR-β both in mRNA and protein levels. P68 promotes EMT and cell migration in response to PDGF-BB stimulation via upregulation of PDGFR-β, suggesting that p68 enhances PDGF signaling by a positive feedback loop in cancer cells. Furthermore, our study reveals that p68 mediates the effects of PDGFR-β in regulation of androgen receptor (AR) in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that p68 and PDGFR-β co-regulate AR expression and promote androgen-mediated proliferation in breast cancer cells. Our studies uncover an important pathway of p68-PDGFR-β axis in promoting breast cancer progression.},

abstract={Disasters, either manmade or natural, call for rapid and timely actions. Due to disaster, all of the communication infrastructures are destroyed, and there is no way for connection between people in disaster and others outside the disaster range. Drone technology is the critical technology for delivering communication services and guiding people and monitoring the unwanted effects of a disaster. The collaboration of advanced technologies can reduce life losses, save people’s lives, and manage the disaster crisis. The network performance of collaboration between the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone edge intelligence can help gather and process data, extend the wireless coverage area, deliver medical emergencies, provide real-time information about the emergency, and gather data from areas that are impossible for humans to reach. In this paper, we focus on the network performance for efficient collaboration of drone edge intelligence and smart wearable devices for disaster management. We focus mainly on network connectivity parameters for improving real-time data sharing between the drone edge intelligence and smart wearable devices. The relevant parameters that are considered in this study include delay, throughput, and the load from drone edge intelligence. It is further shown that network performance can have significant improvement when the abovementioned parameters are correctly optimised, and the improved performance can significantly improve the guiding/coordinating of search and rescue (SAR) teams effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={Abnormal expression of insulin gene enhancer-binding protein 1 (ISL1) has been demonstrated to be closely associated with cancer development and progression in several cancers. However, little is known about ISL1 expression in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). ISL1 has also been recognized as a positive modulator of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we focused on ISL1 which showed maximum upregulation at the mRNA level in the enzalutamide-resistant cell line. Accordingly, we found that ISL1 was overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B cells and its expression was significantly related to EMT. Our findings reveal the important role of ISL1 in androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cell growth; ISL1 knockdown reduced the AR activity and cell growth. ISL1 knockdown using small-interfering RNA inhibited AR, PSA, and EMT-related protein expression in C4-2B ENZR cells. In addition, knock-down ISL1 reduced the levels of AKT and p65 phosphorylation in C4-2B ENZR cells and these suggest that knock-down ISL1 suppresses EMT in part by targeting the AKT/NF-κB pathway. Further, ISL1 downregulation could effectively inhibit tumor growth in a human CRPC xenograft model. Together, the present study shows that downregulation of ISL1 expression is necessary for overcoming enzalutamide resistance and improving the survival of CRPC patients.},

abstract={Background Recent studies highlighted the increased frequency of AR-low or -negative prostate cancers (PCas) and the importance of AR-independent mechanisms in driving metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) development and progression. Several previous studies have highlighted the involvement of the MEN1 gene in PCa. In the current study, we focused on its role specifically in AR-independent PCa cells. Methods Cell tumorigenic features were evaluated by proliferation assay, foci formation, colony formation in soft agar, wound healing assay and xenograft experiments in mice. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining were performed to determine the expression of different factors in human PCa lines. Different ChIP-qPCR-based assays were carried out to dissect the action of JunD and β-catenin. Results We found that MEN1 silencing in AR-independent cell lines, DU145 and PC3, resulted in an increase in anchorage independence and cell migration, accompanied by sustained MYC expression. By searching for factors known to positively regulate MYC expression and play a relevant role in PCa development and progression, we uncovered that MEN1-KD triggered the nuclear translocation of JunD and β-catenin. ChIP and 3C analyses further demonstrated that MEN1-KD led to, on the one hand, augmented binding of JunD to the MYC 5′ enhancer and increased formation of loop structure, and on the other hand, increased binding of β-catenin to the MYC promoter. Moreover, the expression of several molecular markers of EMT, including E-cadherin, BMI1, Twist1 and HIF-1α, was altered in MEN1-KD DU145 and PC3 cells. In addition, analyses using cultured cells and PC3-GFP xenografts in mice demonstrated that JunD and β-catenin are necessary for the altered tumorigenic potential triggered by MEN1 inactivation in AR-independent PCa cells. Finally, we observed a significant negative clinical correlation between MEN1 and CTNNB1 mRNA expression in primary PCa and mCRPC datasets. Conclusions Our current work highlights an unrecognized oncosuppressive role for menin specifically in AR-independent PCa cells, through the activation of JunD and β-catenin pathways.},

abstract={Inhibitor of growth 3 (ING3) is one of five members of the ING tumour suppressor family, characterized by a highly conserved plant homeodomain (PHD) as a reader of the histone mark H3K4me3. ING3 was reported to act as a tumour suppressor in many different cancer types to regulate apoptosis. On the other hand, ING3 levels positively correlate with poor survival prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. In PCa cells, ING3 acts rather as an androgen receptor (AR) co-activator and harbours oncogenic properties in PCa. Here, we show the identification of a novel ING3 splice variant in both the human PCa cell line LNCaP and in human PCa patient specimen. The novel ING3 splice variant lacks exon 11, ING3∆ex11, which results in deletion of the PHD, providing a unique opportunity to analyse functionally the PHD of ING3 by a natural splice variant. Functionally, overexpression of ING3Δex11 induced morphological changes of LNCaP-derived 3D spheroids with generation of lumen and pore-like structures within spheroids. Since these structures are an indicator of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), key regulatory factors and markers for EMT were analysed. The data suggest that in contrast to ING3, ING3Δex11 specifically modulates the expression of key EMT-regulating upstream transcription factors and induces the expression of EMT markers, indicating that the PHD of ING3 inhibits EMT. In line with this, ING3 knockdown also induced the expression of EMT markers, confirming the impact of ING3 on EMT regulation. Further, ING3 knockdown induced cellular senescence via a pathway leading to cell cycle arrest, indicating an oncogenic role for ING3 in PCa. Thus, the data suggest that the ING3Δex11 splice variant lacking functional PHD exhibits oncogenic characteristics through triggering EMT in PCa cells.},

abstract={Simple SummaryProstate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men and is the second leading cause of cancer death in developed countries. Current therapeutics that target the androgen receptor (AR) are only transiently effective. Anti-AR therapy-resistant tumors often emerge with vast cellular and molecular alterations and present themselves at the clinic in more deadly forms including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) or neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). One emerging strategy in effective treatment of the advanced forms of prostate cancer is to target drivers other than AR. The present study shows that the nuclear receptor RORγ and the serine/threonine kinase PBK form a regulatory loop in hyperactive AR signaling. It also demonstrates that orally administered, small-molecule antagonists/inverse agonists of RORγ are effective in blocking the growth of the mCRPC tumors. Our findings provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of RORγ alone or in combination with PBK inhibitors for the advanced forms of prostate cancer.AbstractMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a highly aggressive disease with few therapeutic options. Hyperactive androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a key role in CRPC progression. Previously, we identified RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) as a novel key driver of AR gene overexpression and increased AR signaling. We report here that several RORγ antagonists/inverse agonists including XY018 and compound 31 were orally effective in potent inhibition of the growth of tumor models including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. RORγ controls the expression of multiple aggressive-tumor gene programs including those of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. We found that PDZ binding kinase (PBK), a serine/threonine kinase, is a downstream target of RORγ that exerts the cellular effects. Alterations of RORγ expression or function significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein level of PBK. Our further analyses demonstrated that elevated PBK associates with and stabilizes RORγ and AR proteins, thus constituting novel, interlocked feed-forward loops in hyperactive AR and RORγ signaling. Indeed, dual inhibition of RORγ and PBK synergistically inhibited the expression and function of RORγ, AR, and AR-V7, and the growth and survival of CRPC cells. Therefore, our study provided a promising, new strategy for treatment of advanced forms of prostate cancer.},

abstract={The issue of medication noncompliance has resulted in major risks to public safety and financial loss. The new omnipresent medicine enabled by the Internet of things offers fascinating new possibilities. Additionally, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS), it is necessary to meet the rapidly increasing need for routine nursing and on-site diagnosis and prognosis. This article proposes a universal and preventive strategy to drug management based on intelligent and interactive packaging (I2Pack) and IMedBox. The controlled delamination material (CDM) seals and regulates wireless technologies in novel medicine packaging. As such, wearable biomedical sensors may capture a variety of crucial parameters via wireless communication. On-site treatment and prediction of these critical factors are made possible by high-performance architecture. The user interface is also highlighted to make surgery easier for the elderly, disabled, and patients. Land testing incorporates and validates an approach for prototyping I2Pack and iMedBox. Additionally, sustainability, increased product safety, and quality standards are crucial throughout the life sciences. To achieve these standards, intelligent packaging is also used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. These technologies will continuously monitor the quality of a product and communicate with the user. Data carriers, indications, and sensors are the three most important groups. They are not widely used at the moment, although their potential is well understood. Intelligent packaging should be used in these sectors and the functionality of the systems and the values presented in this analysis.},

abstract={Emergency operations are a key example for the need of digital twins in the way it is complex, urgent and uncertain. First, the process is complex, as many organizations are involved. Second, it is urgent, as most damage is done in the first moments of an emergency. Third, it is uncertain, as situational conditions tend to change quickly.For outdoor operations, spatial information systems help in creating an overview of the situation, for example by displaying positions of first responder units involved with the incident. However, spatial data of indoor environments is scarce. Static information of the building, such as floor plans, are often outdated or non-existent. Dynamic operational data such as positions of first responders within the building are only available in a very limited way as well, and often without visual representation.To create situation awareness of indoor first responder operation environments, this paper successfully proposes a proof of concept with two objectives. First, the proof of concept will collect spatial environment data in the form of mapping and tracking data by using a Microsoft HoloLens. This means the geometry of the building will be collected, together with traversed routes within the building. Second, the data will be streamed and displayed to a remote first responder coordinator in real-time to create a common operational picture. This enables the coordinator to quickly build situation awareness of the operation environment, enabling the coordinator to improve the quality of decisions, thereby improving first responder performance. The proof of concept showed that situation awareness on all three levels increases with the real-time (live) availability (visualisations) of 3D indoor environments. This concept needs to be tested further on usability and performance.},

abstract={Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are first-line drugs for lung cancers with activating EGFR mutations. Although first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs were standard first-line treatments, acquired resistance (AR) to these drugs is almost inevitable. Cell line models have been widely used to explore the molecular mechanisms of AR to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Many research groups, including ours, have established AR cell lines that harbor the EGFR T790M secondary mutation, MET gene amplification, or epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, which are all found in clinical specimens obtained from TKI-refractory lesions. Currently, many oncologists prescribe osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI that can overcome T790M-mediated resistance, as a first-line TKI. Although few clinical data are available about AR mechanisms that arise when osimertinib is used as a first-line therapy, many research groups have established cell lines with AR to osimertinib and have reported on their AR mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the findings on AR mechanisms against first-line osimertinib obtained from analyses of cell line models.},

abstract={Metastasis is a primary reason related to the mortality of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. A program called epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to play a critical role in promoting metastasis in epithelium‐derived carcinoma. During EMT, epithelial cancer cells acquire motile mesenchymal phenotypes and detach from primary tumors. Recent lines of evidence have suggested that EMT confers cancer cells with tumor‐initiating ability. Therefore, selective targeting of EMT would lead to the development of effective therapeutic agents. In this study, using a chemical biology approach, we identified isoxsuprine, a β2‐adrenergic receptor (β2‐AR) agonist as a low‐molecular‐weight compound that interferes with the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes of oral cancer cells. Treatment of multiple types of oral cancer cells with isoxsuprine led to the downregulation of mesenchymal cell markers that was accompanied by reduced cell motility. Similar inhibitory effects were also observed for isoprenaline, a non‐selective β‐adrenergic receptor (β‐AR) agonist. In addition, inhibition of cell migration upon treatment with isoxsuprine was reverted by a non‐selective β‐AR antagonist, propranolol, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system‐mediated deletion of the β2‐AR gene, suggesting that the effects exerted by isoxsuprine involved signals mediated by β2‐AR. In addition, in a subcutaneous xenograft model of oral cancer cells, the administration of isoxsuprine effectively suppressed primary tumor growth, suggesting β2‐AR signals to be a promising cancer therapeutic target for treatment of OSCC.},

abstract={Multiple mechanisms contribute to the survival and growth of metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cells without androgen, including androgen receptor splice variants (AR‐V) and de novo intratumoral androgen synthesis. AKR1C3 is a critical androgenic enzyme that plays different roles in mCRPC, such as an EMT driver or AR coactivator. However, the relationship and regulatory mechanisms between AKR1C3 and AR‐V remain largely unknown. In this study, we observed a positive correlation between AKR1C3 and AR‐V7 staining in tissues from prostate rebiopsy at mCRPC. Mechanistically, AKR1C3 interacts with AR‐V7 protein in CRPC cells, which can reciprocally inhibit AR‐V7 and AKR1C3 protein degradation. Biologically, this complex is essential for in vitro and in vivo tumour growth of CRPC cells after androgen deprivation as it represses B4GALT1, a unique tumour suppressor gene in PCa. Together, this study reveals AKR1C3/AR‐V7 complex as a potential therapeutic target in mCRPC.},

abstract={Kidney cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat by targeted and radiation therapy. Therefore, identifying key regulators in this cancer is especially important for finding new drugs. We focused on androgen receptor (AR) regulation by its epigenetic co-regulator lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) in kidney cancer development. LSD1 knock-down in kidney cancer cells decreased expression of AR target genes. Moreover, the binding of AR to target gene promoters was reduced and histone methylation status was changed in LSD1 knock-down kidney cancer cells. LSD1 knock-down also slowed growth and decreased the migration ability of kidney cancer cells. We found that pargyline, known as a LSD1 inhibitor, can reduce AR activity in kidney cancer cells. The treatment of kidney cancer cells with pargyline delayed growth and repressed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. These effects were additively enhanced by co-treatment with the AR inhibitor enzalutamide. Down-regulation of LSD1 in renal cancer cells (RCC) attenuated in vivo tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. These results provide evidence that LSD1 can regulate kidney cancer cell growth via epigenetic control of AR transcription factors and that LSD1 inhibitors may be good candidate drugs for treating kidney cancer.},

abstract={Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the development of severe lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, it has been reported that EMT involves complex metabolic reprogramming triggered by several factors including transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and that monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1) plays an essential role in these metabolic changes. The aim of the present study was to clarify the functional expression of MCT1 during TGF-β1-induced EMT in alveolar epithelial A549 cells. The transport function of MCT1 in A549 cells was examined using 3H]γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and 3H] lactic acid (LA) as substrates and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC), lactic acid, phloretin, and AR-C155858 (AR) as inhibitors of MCT1. EMT was induced by treating the cells with TGF-β1. mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed using real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent GHB and LA uptake were observed in A549 cells. CHC, lactic acid, phloretin, and AR significantly inhibited the uptake of GHB in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that MCT1 is primarily responsible for transport of monocarboxylates such as GHB and LA in A549 cells. TGF-β1 treatment significantly enhanced GHB and LA uptake as well as the mRNA and protein expression levels of MCT1 in A549 cells. These changes were neutralized by co-treatment with SB431542, an inhibitor for the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. CHC and AR had no effect on TGF-β1-induced EMT-related gene expression changes. Here, we have clearly characterized functional expression of MCT1 in A549 cells and have shown that MCT1 may be upregulated via the TGF-β1 signaling pathway.},

abstract={Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates a number of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is upregulated in prostate cancer. Androgen regulation of Twist1 has been reported in a previous study. However, the mechanism of androgen regulation of the Twist1 gene is not understood because the Twist1 promoter lacks androgen receptor (AR)-responsive elements. Previous studies have shown that the Twist1 promoter has putative binding sites for PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors. Our lab has previously identified Ets Variant 1 (ETV1), a member of the PEA3 subfamily, as a novel androgen-regulated gene that is involved in prostate cancer cell invasion through unknown mechanism. In view of these data, we hypothesized that androgen-activated AR upregulates Twist1 gene expression via ETV1. Our data confirmed the published work that androgen positively regulates Twist1 gene expression and further showed that this positive effect was directed at the Twist1 promoter. The positive effect of androgen on Twist1 gene expression was abrogated upon disruption of AR expression by siRNA or of AR activity by Casodex. More importantly, our data show that disruption of ETV1 leads to significant decrease in both androgen-mediated upregulation as well as basal level of Twist1, which we are able to rescue upon re-expression of ETV1. Indeed, we are able to show that ETV1 mediates the androgen upregulation of Twist1 by acting on the proximal region of Twist1 promoter. Additionally, our data show that Twist1 regulates prostate cancer cell invasion and EMT, providing a possible mechanism by which ETV1 mediates prostate cancer cell invasion. In conclusion, in this study we report Twist1 as an indirect target of AR and androgen regulation through ETV1.},

abstract={The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a molecular process connected to higher expression of vimentin and increased activity of transcription factors (Snail, Twist) which restrains E-cadherin. EMT has been linked to prostate cancer metastatic potential, therapy resistance, and poor outcomes. Kinetin riboside (9-(b-dribofuranosyl)-6-furfurylaminopurine, KR) is a naturally occurring cytokinin, which induces apoptosis and shows strong antiproliferative activity against various human cancer cell lines. To establish the effect of KR on human prostate cell lines, expression of, e.g. AR, E-, N-cadherins, Vimentin, Snail, Twist, and MMPs, was analysed at mRNA and protein levels using Western Blot and RT-PCR and/or RQ-PCR techniques. KR inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cells, but also, to a small extent, of normal cells. This effect depended on the type of the cells and their androgen sensitivity. KR also decreased the level of p-Akt, which takes part in androgen signalling modulation. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated in cancer cell lines, while that of Bax is up-regulated upon KR exposure. KR contributed to re-expression of the E-cadherin as well as to significant changes in cell migration. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that KR can be proposed as a factor for signalling pathways regulation that participates in the inhibition of development of aggressive forms of prostate cancer, and may alter the approach to therapeutic interventions. We propose KR as a potent inhibitor of EMT in human prostate cells.},

abstract={Traditionally, studies to address the characterization of mechanisms promoting tumor aggressiveness and progression have been focused only on primary tumor analyses, which could provide relevant information but have limitations to really characterize the more aggressive tumor population. To overcome these limitations, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent a noninvasive and valuable tool for real-time profiling of disseminated tumor cells. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the value of CTC enumeration and characterization to identify markers associated with the outcome and the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). For that aim, the CTC population from 32 patients diagnosed with TNBC was isolated and characterized. This population showed important cell plasticity in terms of expression of epithelia/mesenchymal and stemness markers, suggesting the relevance of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) intermediate phenotypes for efficient tumor dissemination. Importantly, the CTC signature demonstrated prognostic value to predict the patients’ outcome and pointed to a relevant role of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and androgen receptor (AR) for TNBC biology. Furthermore, we also analyzed the usefulness of the AR and TIMP1 blockade to target TNBC proliferation and dissemination using in vitro and in vivo zebra fish and mouse models. Overall, the molecular characterization of CTCs from advanced TNBC patients identifies highly specific biomarkers with potential applicability as noninvasive prognostic markers and reinforced the value of TIMP1 and AR as potential therapeutic targets to tackle the most aggressive breast cancer.},

abstract={Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Although great progress has been made in diagnosis and treatment strategies in recent years, the 5-year survival rate of OSCC patients is still disappointingly low. Hence, there is still an unmet medical need for sufferers with OSCC. As a downstream effector of Hippo pathway, TAZ was up-regulated in multiple cancers including OSCC, and considered as an effective therapeutic target. In this study, we constructed a stable transfected cell line HEK293-TAZ to screen TAZ inhibitor using dual-luciferase reporter assay, and found a potential TAZ inhibitor AR-42. The results showed that AR-42 effectively suppressed the viability and proliferation of OSCC cells, and induced cellular apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Moreover, AR-42 potently inhibited cell invasion and the capacity of sphere-forming, as well as the expression of EMT and cancer stem cell related proteins in OSCC cells, exhibiting potential efficacy against OSCC metastasis and self-renewal of oral cancer stem cell. Further mechanism studies showed that AR-42 inhibited the total amount of TAZ and its paralog YAP mainly through blockade of TAZ/YAP transcription and promotion of TAZ/YAP protein degradation. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of AR-42 against TAZ, as well as its anti-OSCC activity could be also observed in SCC9 xenograft model. Taken together, AR-42 deserves to be further studied as a TAZ inhibitor, and is worthy to be further assessed as a potential drug candidate for OSCC treatment.},

abstract={Luminal androgen receptor (LAR) breast cancer accounts for 10% of all triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Anti-androgen therapy for this subtype is in development, but yields only partial clinical benefits. In this study, we aimed to characterize the genomic alterations of LAR TNBC, to analyze activation of the PI3K signaling pathway and to compare the response to PI3K pathway inhibitors with that to anti-androgen therapy in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of LAR TNBC. Methods: Four LAR PDX models were identified, on the basis of their transcriptomic profiles, in a cohort of 57 PDX models of TNBC. The expression of AR-related genes, basal and luminal cytokeratins and EMT genes was analyzed by RT-PCR and IHC. AKT1 and PIK3CA mutations were identified by targeted NGS, and activation of the PI3K pathway was analyzed with a reverse-phase protein array. Three LAR PDXs with a PIK3CA or AKT1 mutation were treated with the AR inhibitor enzalutamide, a PI3K inhibitor, a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor and a mTORC1-mTORC2 inhibitor. Finally, we screened a clinical cohort of 329 TNBC for PIK3CA and AKT1 hotspot mutations. Results: LAR TNBC PDXs were significantly enriched in PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations, and had higher levels of luminal-androgen-like gene expression and a higher PI3K pathway protein activation score than other TNBC subtypes. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed strong expression of the luminal cytokeratin CK18 and AR in three LAR PDX models. We found that mTOR and PI3K inhibitors had marked antitumor activity in vivo in PDX harboring genomic alterations of PIK3CA and AKT1 genes that did not respond to the AR antagonist enzalutamide. PIK3CA mutations were detected in more than one third of AR+ TNBC from patients (38%), and only 10% of AR-negative TNBC. Conclusion: Our results for PDX models of LAR TNBC resistant to enzalutamide indicate that PIK3CA and AKT1 are potential therapeutic targets.},

abstract={Purpose: The clinical studies carried out in the last few decades unequivocally introduced activated androgen receptor (AR) as a pathogenic feature of human malignancies which not only endows cancer cells with survival advantage, but also may be exploited for anticancer interventions. Patients and Methods: In this study, we have investigated the expression profile of AR and EMT-related genes in fresh gastric cancer (GC), adjacent nontumor and normal gastric tissues, as well as the effect and molecular mechanisms of AR inhibition in GC cell lines. Results: Amongst 60 GC patients, 66.7% overexpressed AR that was remarkably correlated with the overexpression of Snail, β-catenin, Twist1, and STAT3. AR overexpression was also remarkably associated with unfavorable outcome (HR=3.478, P=0.001); however, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that it was not an independent prognostic factor (HR=2.089, P=0.056). This study has investigated simultaneous assessment of AR and EMT-related genes expression and indicated that concurrent overexpression of AR and Snail is an independent unfavorable factor for GC overall survival after adjustment with other variables (HR=2.382, P=0.021). Interestingly, the inhibition of AR signaling by potent AR antagonist enzalutamide suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion of GC cells via regulation of apoptosis-, cell cycle-, and EMT-related gene expressions. Conclusion: Our findings have clinical importance proposing AR as an important prognostic factor involved in GC progression and metastasis, and submit AR inhibition as an appealing therapeutic approach for GC patients, either as a single agent or in a combined-modal strategy.},

abstract={Male gender is a risk factor for mortality in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This study investigated the impact of androgen receptor (AR) gene expression on the clinical features and progression of PTC. The levels of AR mRNA and protein in frozen, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from PTC and adjacent normal thyroid tissue were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining, respectively, and the relationships between AR expression and clinical features were analyzed. The thyroid cancer cell lines, BCPAP and TPC-1, were used to evaluate the effects of AR on the regulation of cell migration, and key epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. AR mRNA expression was significantly higher in normal thyroid tissue from men than women. The sex difference in AR mRNA expression diminished during PTC tumorigenesis, as AR mRNA expression levels were lower in PTC than normal thyroid tissues from both men and women. AR mRNA expression was significantly decreased in PTC patients with higher risk and in those with extrathyroidal extension. Overexpression of AR in BCPAP cells decreased cell migration and repressed the EMT process by down-regulating mRNA expression of N-cadherin, Snail1, Snail2, Vimentin, and TWIST1 and up-regulating E-cadherin gene expression. These results suggest that suppression of the androgen–AR axis may lead to aggressive tumor behavior in patients with PTC.},

abstract={B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 (BMI1) has been reported to be an oncoprotein. BMI1 represses tumor suppressors to promote cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer progression. Although it is known that the expression of BMI1 is increased in many cancer types, the mechanism of BMI1 upregulation is not yet clear. We performed integrative analysis for 3 sets of prostate cancer (PCa) genomic data, and found that BMI1 and androgen receptor (AR) were positively correlated, suggesting that AR might regulate BMI1. Next, we showed that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) upregulated both mRNA and protein levels of BMI1 and that BMI1 was increased in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) from both human patients and a mouse xenograph model. We further identified an AR binding site in the promoter/enhancer region of BMI1, and confirmed BMI1 as the direct target of AR using gene-editing technology. We also demonstrated that high expression of BMI1 is critical for the development of castration-resistance. Our data also suggest that BMI1-specific inhibitors could be an effective treatment of CRPC.},

abstract={Global Burden of Disease Report, released in Sept 2017, shows that Cardio- vascular Diseases caused 1.7 million deaths (17.8%) in 2016 and it is the leading cause of deaths in India 1]. According to the Indian Heart Association, 25% of all heart attacks happen under the age of 40. In most cases, the initial heart attacks are often ignored. Even post-diagnosis, as per government data 2], 50% of heart attack cases reach the hospital in more than 400 minutes against the ideal window time of 180 minutes; post which damage is irreversible. The delay is often attributed to delay in reaching a hospital or receiving primary aid. In India, traffic conditions also add to the grimace of the situation. Although the government is taking various measures; a holistic solution is required to minimize the delay at each of the steps like accessing the patient situation, contacting the Medical aid or making available the nearest aid possible. In this paper, we aim at providing the holistic solution using the Internet of Things technology (IOT) along with data analytics. IoT enables real-time capturing and computation of medical data from smart sensors built-in wearable devices. The amalgamation of Internet-based services with Medical Things (Smart sensors) enhance the chances of survival of patients. The proposed system analyses the inputs collected from the sensors fit with the patients prone to cardiovascular diseases to ascertain the emergency situation. In addition, to these data, the system also considers age, maximum and minimum heart rate. Based on computational results received from the input parameters, the system triggers the alert to emergency contacts such as the close relatives of the patient, doctors, the hospitals and nearby ambulance. The proposed system combines with the optimized navigation platform to guide the medical assistance to find the fastest route.},

abstract={Androgen receptor (AR) signalling is a key prostate cancer (PC) driver, even in advanced ‘castrate-resistant’ disease (CRPC). To systematically identify microRNAs (miRs) modulating AR activity in lethal disease, hormone-responsive and -resistant PC cells expressing a luciferase-based AR reporter were transfected with a miR inhibitor library; 78 inhibitors significantly altered AR activity. Upon validation, miR-346, miR-361-3p and miR-197 inhibitors markedly reduced AR transcriptional activity, mRNA and protein levels, increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation, repressed EMT, and inhibited PC migration and invasion, demonstrating additive effects with AR inhibition. Corresponding miRs increased AR activity through a novel and anti-dogmatic mechanism of direct association with AR 6.9 kb 3′UTR and transcript stabilisation. In addition, miR-346 and miR-361-3p modulation altered levels of constitutively active AR variants, and inhibited variant-driven PC cell proliferation, so may contribute to persistent AR signalling in CRPC in the absence of circulating androgens. Pathway analysis of AGO-PAR-CLIP-identified miR targets revealed roles in DNA replication and repair, cell cycle, signal transduction and immune function. Silencing these targets, including tumour suppressors ARHGDIA and TAGLN2, phenocopied miR effects, demonstrating physiological relevance. MiR-346 additionally upregulated the oncogene, YWHAZ, which correlated with grade, biochemical relapse and metastasis in patients. These AR-modulatory miRs and targets correlated with AR activity in patient biopsies, and were elevated in response to long-term enzalutamide treatment of patient-derived CRPC xenografts. In summary, we identified miRs that modulate AR activity in PC and CRPC, via novel mechanisms, and may represent novel PC therapeutic targets.},

abstract={It has become clear that disaster relief needs to transition from good intentions or a charity-based approach to a professional, outcome-oriented response. The practice of medicine in disaster and conflict is a profession practiced in environments where lack of resources, chaos, and unpredictability are the norm rather than the exception. With this consideration in mind, the World Health Organization (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) and its partners set out to improve the disaster response systems. The resulting Emergency Medical Team (EMT) classification system requires that teams planning on engaging in disaster response follow common standards for the delivery of care in resource-constraint environments. In order to clarify these standards, the WHO EMT Secretariat collaborated with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC; Geneva, Switzerland) and leading experts from other stakeholder non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to produce a guide to the management of limb injuries in disaster and conflict.The resulting text is a free and open-access resource to provide guidance for national and international EMTs caring for patients in disasters and conflicts. The content is a result of expert consensus, literature review, and an iterative process designed to encourage debate and resolution of existing open questions within the field of disaster and conflict medical response.The end result of this process is a text providing guidance to providers seeking to deliver safe, effective care within the EMT framework that is now part of the EMT training and verification system and is being distributed to ICRC teams deploying to the field.This work seeks to encourage professionalization of the field of disaster and conflict response, and to contribute to the existing EMT framework, in order to provide for better care for future victims of disaster and conflict.Jensen G, Bar-On E, Wiedler JT, Hautz SC, Veen H, Kay AR, Norton I, Gosselin RA, von Schreeb J.

abstract={BackgroundHIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) aims at preventing HIV transmission through the intake of antiretroviral treatment (ART), after an occupational (OC) or non-occupational context (NOC) exposure.PurposeIn order to determine the safety and effectiveness of HIV PEP this study aimed to characterise patients who initiated PEP.Material and methodsRetrospective descriptive study, between January 2016 and September 2018. All the patients above 18 years’ old who presented risk of HIV contact and were medicated with PEP in the hospital pharmacy (HP), were included. Data were obtained from electronic medical records.ResultsA total of 105 PEP were dispensed in HP, 52.4% in an OC and 47.6% in a NOC, mostly female (64.8%) with a mean age of 35.5±12.9 years.In OC, females prevailed (83.6%). PEP intake was justified when there was contact with infected fluids through: accidental puncture (83.6%), eyeball contamination (12.7%) and skin-mucus membranes lacerations (3.6%). 41.5% were healthcare work-related accidents.Regarding NOC, 56.0% were male. Prescriptions reasons were: unprotected sex 34.7%, condom rupture 32.7%, rape 22.5% and others 10.2%.Source HIV serology was unknown in 70.5% of the cases.From the 105 PEP treatment initiated, six were suspended after knowing the source of HIV negative serology.The initial ART mostly used was raltegravir (RAL) +emtricitabine/tenofovir (3TC/TDF) (78%). Others ART were initially used (22%), provided either by the emergency service or by another HP. RAL +3 TC/TDF combination was the main choice due to its tolerability profile and recent guidelines.1Twenty-six patients experienced adverse reactions (AR) such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness and heart palpitations.63.8% patients completed 6 months post-exposure serological follow-up, with no cases of seroconversion, and were discharged. 18.1% of patients missed the follow-up serology and appointments, and the remaining patients are still are under evaluation. Prophylaxis was proposed to five patients, four of them for systematic risk behaviours and one for serodiscordant partner.ConclusionPEP has proved to be effective and safe (low severity AR) preventing HIV transmission. Variation of ARV used in PEP reflects the updating of the guidelines.1 and/or acknowledgements1.

abstract={In this paper, we provide an overview of positioning systems for moving resources in forest and fire management and review the related literature. Emphasis is placed on the accuracy and range of different localization and location-sharing methods, particularly in forested environments and in the absence of conventional cellular or internet connectivity. We then conduct a second review of literature and concepts related to several emerging, broad themes in data science, including the terms location-based services (LBS), geofences, wearable technology, activity recognition, mesh networking, the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Our objective in this second review is to inform how these broader concepts, with implications for networking and analytics, may help to advance natural resource management and science in the future. Based on methods, themes, and concepts that arose in our systematic reviews, we then augmented the paper with additional literature from wildlife and fisheries management, as well as concepts from video object detection, relative positioning, and inventory-tracking that are also used as forms of localization. Based on our reviews of positioning technologies and emerging data science themes, we present a hierarchical model for collecting and sharing data in forest and fire management, and more broadly in the field of natural resources. The model reflects tradeoffs in range and bandwidth when recording, processing, and communicating large quantities of data in time and space to support resource management, science, and public safety in remote areas. In the hierarchical approach, wearable devices and other sensors typically transmit data at short distances using Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or ANT wireless, and smartphones and tablets serve as intermediate data collection and processing hubs for information that can be subsequently transmitted using radio networking systems or satellite communication. Data with greater spatial and temporal complexity is typically processed incrementally at lower tiers, then fused and summarized at higher levels of incident command or resource management. Lastly, we outline several priority areas for future research to advance big data analytics in natural resources.},

abstract={Purpose: Perineural invasion (PNI) is reported to correlate with local recurrence and poor prognosis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). However, the pathogenesis of PNI remains unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the correlation between sympathetic innervation and SACC PNI and to elucidate how the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) regulates the PNI process. Materials and methods: Sympathetic innervation and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) expression in SACC tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The NE concentrations in SACC tissues and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) coculture models were measured by ELISA. β2-AR expression in SACC cells was detected by performing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assay. SACC cells were treated with NE, the nonselective α-AR blocker phentolamine, the β2-AR antagonist ICI118,551, or were transfected with β2-AR small interfering RNA (siRNA). Proliferation was evaluated in methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, and migration was evaluated in Transwell assay and wound-healing assay. PNI was tested through both Transwell assay and a DRG coculture model. The expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were measured by performing qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. Results: Sympathetic innervation and β2-AR were highly distributed in SACC tissues and correlated positively with PNI (P=0.035 and P=0.003, respectively). The sympathetic neurotransmitter NE was overexpressed in SACC tissues and DRG coculture models. Exogenously added NE promoted proliferation, migration, and PNI of SACC cells via β2-AR activation. NE/β2-AR signaling may promote proliferation, migration, and PNI by inducing EMT and upregulating MMPs. However, β2-AR inhibition with either an antagonist or siRNA abrogated NE-induced PNI. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings reveal the supportive role of sympathetic innervation in the pathogenesis of SACC PNI and suggest β2-AR as a potential therapeutic target for treating PNI in SACC.},

abstract={Background Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who are non-improvers after two weeks of antidepressant treatment have a high risk of treatment failure. Recently, we did not find differences in outcomes in non-improvers randomized to an early medication change (EMC) strategy compared to treatment as usual (TAU). This secondary analysis investigated possible predictors of higher remission rates in the EMC strategy. Methods Of 192 non-improvers (i.e. decrease of ≤20% on the HAMD-17 depression scale) after a two-week treatment with escitalopram, n = 97 were randomized to EMC (immediate switch to high doses of venlafaxine XR) and n = 95 to TAU (continued escitalopram until day 28 with non-responders switched to venlafaxine XR). We first analyzed patient characteristics, psychopathological features and subtypes of MDD by logistic regression analyses as possible predictors of remission rates. In a second investigation, we analyzed the predictors, which showed a significant association in the first analysis before Bonferroni-Holm correction by chi-squared tests separated for treatment groups. All analyses were corrected by Bonferroni-Holm method. Results The first analyses yielded no statistically significant results after correction for multiple testing. In the second analyses, however, patients with prior medication at study entry showed higher remission rates in EMC than in TAU (24.2% versus 8.6%, p = 0.017; Bonferroni-Holm corrected significance level: p = 0.025.). Furthermore, patients with a recurrent course of MDD benefited less from treatment as usual (p = 0.009; Bonferroni-Holm corrected significance level: p = 0.025). Age, sex, age of onset, psychiatric or somatic comorbidities, and other subtypes of MDD did not predict remission rates. Conclusions Although in our first analysis we found statistically non-significant results, the second analysis showed significant differences in remission rates between patients with or without previous medication and in patients with recurrent MDD or the first depressive episode. It would therefore be valuable to examine in larger and prospective studies whether remission rates can be increased by quick escalation of treatment in certain subgroups of patients. Promising subgroups to be tested are patients who were previously medicated, and who show a recurrent course of MDD. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00974155.

abstract={Androgen receptor (AR) is emerging as a novel prognostic biomarker in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. As accumulating evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate important cancer hallmarks, we hypothesised that AR-regulated lncRNAs might play roles in TNBC progression. Here, we performed experiments with or without DHT treatment in three TNBC cell lines, and we identified an AR negatively induced lncRNA (ARNILA), which correlated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) in TNBC patients and promoted epithelial−mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, we demonstrated that ARNILA functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-204 to facilitate expression of its target gene Sox4, which is known to induce EMT and contribute to breast cancer progression, thereby promoting EMT, invasion and metastasis of TNBC. Our findings not only provide new insights into the mechanisms of lncRNA in regulating AR but also suggest ARNILA as an alternative therapeutic target to suppress metastasis of TNBC patients.},

abstract={AimsThe aim was to improve the prescription of intravenous (IV) fluids in the emergency department, medical wards and surgical wards using principles of leadership and service improvement.MethodsThe proposed change to practice was to introduce a new IV fluid prescription sheet that contained decision-aids that closely matched the most recent NICE guidelines on IV prescription in adults. The change was assessed in three ways. Firstly, the NICE clinical audit tool for IV fluid prescription in adults was performed before and during the pilot period by junior doctors working in the acute medical unit (AMU). Secondly, electronic records for sodium and potassium blood results were measured for the first 7 days of admission both before and during the intervention. Chi-square test was used to test for significance. Thirdly, a feedback sheet was put up in the nursing and non-medical staff room for comments on the intervention. Principles of trainee doctor leadership such as early senior medical staff buy-in, multi-disciplinary involvement and qualitative feedback were used.ResultsThere was a statistically significant reduction in rates of hypokalaemia, defined as a potassium result below the reference range, for the first 7 days following admission to hospital via the AMU. There was a mixed response to the NICE Clinical Audit tool, with improvements in some areas and reductions in others. Qualitative feedback helped discover issues with the sheet not previously identified.ConclusionsIt is possible to lead a service improvement project as a foundation trainee. The principles of medical leadership and service improvement genuinely help to make small ideas into reality. This project shows that small simple changes to frequently performed tasks in a hospital have the potential to impact patient safety. The trial fluid prescription sheet is being used to inform the implementation and design of electronic IV fluid prescribing within the trust.},

abstract={Androgen receptor (AR), an androgen‐activated transcription factor, belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. AR plays an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role of AR in PCa metastasis is not fully understood. To investigate the role of AR in PCa metastasis, we examined AR expression level in primary and metastatic PCa by analyzing gene array data of 378 primary prostate tumors and 120 metastatic prostate tumors from Oncomine, as well as carrying out immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 56 prostate cancer samples. Expression of mRNA and protein of AR as well as its target gene prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) was much higher in metastatic prostate tumors than in primary prostate tumors. Knockdown of AR with siRNA or treating with anti‐androgen Casodex reduced migration and invasion ability of C4‐2B PCa cells. Knockdown of AR increased protein expression of E‐cadherin and AR coregulator KAT5 but reduced expression of epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins Slug, Snail, MMP‐2, vimentin, and β‐catenin. Knockdown of KAT5 increased migration of C4‐2B cells, whereas overexpression of KAT5 suppressed cell migration. KAT5 knockdown rescues the suppressive effect of AR knockdown on migration of C4‐2B cells. Gene expression level of AR and KAT5 showed a negative correlation. PCa patients with higher AR expression or lower KAT5 expression correlated with shorter recurrence‐free survival. Our study suggested that elevation of AR expression and AR signaling in prostate tumors promotes PCa metastasis by induction of EMT and reduction of KAT5.},

abstract={Objectives Apocrine carcinoma is a carcinoma showing cytological and immunohistochemical features of apocrine cells in >90% of the tumor cells (WHO 2003). Apocrine carcinomas are typically GCDFP-15 positive. Recently, they have been shown to be ER, PR negative but AR positive. Some pathologists have argued that it should be considered a subtype of breast carcinoma because of its unique microscopic appearance. We evaluate five cases of apocrine carcinoma, including some evidence of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Methods A 2-year prospective study of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of all breast lesions diagnosed as apocrine carcinoma was retrieved. H&E slides were cut and stained. Immunohistochemical stains were done using six antibodies, ER, Her2, PR, AR, E-cadherin, and vimentin, using the DB-Biotech protocol. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Results Five cases of apocrine carcinoma were reviewed. Age range was 25 to 60 years with a mean age of 43.6 ± 14.0. Histology showed tumor nests having hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and granular cytoplasm; some spindling of tumor cells was seen. ER and PR were negative, Her2 was positive in three cases, and AR was positive in all tumors. Two cases showed loss of E-cadherin and focal areas of positive staining with vimentin. Conclusion Apocrine breast carcinoma is a distinct type of breast cancer that may signify a bad prognosis in our environment because of its presentation at younger age group and tendency for it to display EMT. We advocate molecular testing for possible targeted therapy in the future.},

abstract={BackgroundHealthcare providers and law enforcement (LE) officers are among the most common first responders to injuring events. Despite frequent interface between the health system (HS) and LE sectors, the published evidence that supports their collaboration in injury surveillance, control and prevention has not been comprehensively reviewed.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of literature published from 1990 to 2016 that focused on local and regional HS and LE collaborations in injury surveillance, control and prevention. Our aim was to describe what is known and what remains unexplored about these cross-sector efforts.Results128 articles were included in the final review. These were categorised by their focus on either surveillance activities or partnerships in injury control and prevention programmes. The majority of surveillance articles focused on road traffic injuries. Conversely, articles describing partnerships and programme evaluations primarily targeted the prevention of interpersonal violence.DiscussionThis review yielded two major findings: overall, the combination of HS and LE injury data added value to surveillance systems, especially as HS data augmented LE data; and HS and LE partnerships have been developed to improve injury control and prevention. However, there are few studies that have evaluated the impact and sustainability of these partnerships.ConclusionsThe current evidence to support HS and LE collaboration in injury surveillance and control and prevention programmes is heterogeneous. Notable gaps suggest ample opportunity for further research and programme evaluation across all types of injury.},

abstract={The major challenge in the treatment of patients with advanced lethal prostate cancer is therapeutic resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy. Overriding this resistance requires understanding of the driving mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment, not just the androgen receptor (AR)-signaling cascade, that facilitate therapeutic resistance in order to identify new drug targets. The tumor microenvironment enables key signaling pathways promoting cancer cell survival and invasion via resistance to anoikis. In particular, the process of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), directed by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), confers stem cell properties and acquisition of a migratory and invasive phenotype via resistance to anoikis. Our lead agent DZ-50 may have a potentially high efficacy in advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by eliciting an anoikis-driven therapeutic response. The plasticity of differentiated prostate tumor gland epithelium allows cells to de-differentiate into mesenchymal cells via EMT and re-differentiate via reversal to mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) during tumor progression. A characteristic feature of EMT landscape is loss of E-cadherin, causing adherens junction breakdown, which circumvents anoikis, promoting metastasis and chemoresistance. The targetable interactions between androgens/AR and TGF-β signaling are being pursued towards optimized therapeutic regimens for the treatment of mCRPC. In this review, we discuss the recent evidence on targeting the EMT-MET dynamic interconversions to overcome therapeutic resistance in patients with recurrent therapeutically resistant prostate cancer. Exploitation of the phenotypic landscape and metabolic changes that characterize the prostate tumor microenvironment in advanced prostate cancer and consequential impact in conferring treatment resistance are also considered in the context of biomarker discovery.},

abstract={The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is reported to have intimate crosstalk with androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer (PCa) and is known to be responsible for castration resistance. Fibroblast growth factor/receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling is also involved in tumor progression and EMT in multiple tissues. Several studies have investigated the role of βKlotho, an FGF/FGFR signaling co-receptor in tumorigenesis. However, its role in PCa remains unknown. In the present study, the role of androgen in the EMT of PCa cells was examined by western blotting. The expression of βKlotho was examined in prostate cells and PCa tissues by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The biological role of βKlotho was revealed by a series of functional in vitro and in vivo studies. We determined that βKlotho expression was significantly decreased in PCa tissues compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, and low βKlotho expression was associated with a high Gleason score of PCa. βKlotho overexpression inhibited the viability, migration, and androgen/AR-associated EMT of PCa cells through the inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Notably, βKlotho overexpression inhibited prostate tumor growth and EMT in vivo. Knockdown of βKlotho produced the opposite effects. In conclusion, βKlotho inhibits EMT and plays a tumor-suppressive role in PCa, linking FGF/FGFR/βKlotho signaling to the regulation of PCa progression.},

abstract={Introduction Prostate carcinoma (PRAD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies amongst men worldwide. It is well-known that androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in a vast majority of prostate tumors. However, recent evidence emerged stating that estrogen receptors (ERs) may also contribute to prostate tumor development. Moreover, progression and aggressiveness of prostate cancer may be associated with differential expression genes of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore we aimed to assess the significance of receptors status as well as EMT marker genes expression among PRAD patients in accordance to their age and Gleason score. Materials and methods We analyzed TCGA gene expression profiles of 497 prostate tumor samples according to 43 genes involved in EMT and 3 hormone receptor genes (AR, ESR1, ESR2) as well as clinical characteristic of cancer patients. Then patients were divided into four groups according to their age and 5 groups according to Gleason score. Next, we evaluated PRAD samples according to relationship between the set of variables in different combinations and compared differential expression in subsequent groups of patients. The analysis was applied using R packages: FactoMineR, gplots, RColorBrewer and NMF. Results MFA analysis resulted in distinct grouping of PRAD patients into four age categories according to expression level of AR, ESR1 and ESR2 with the most distinct group of age less than 50 years old. Further investigations indicated opposite expression profiles of EMT markers between different age groups as well as strong association of EMT gene expression with Gleason score. We found that depending on age of prostate cancer patients and Gleason score EMT genes with distinctly altered expression are: KRT18, KRT19, MUC1 and COL4A1, CTNNB1, SNAI2, ZEB1 and MMP3. Conclusions Our major observation is that prostate cancer from patients under 50 years old compared to older ones has entirely different EMT gene expression profiles showing potentially more aggressive invasive phenotype, despite Gleason score classification.},

abstract={Introduction Although many care homes are committed to providing good quality end of life care, in reality a significant number of Nursing Home (NH) residents die in hospital after emergency admission hours or days before their death. To provide more coordinated services for dying people and their families, the hospice in partnership with a NH developed a six month project with the NH providing 2 palliative care beds and in return for a comprehensive training package in end of life care. Research aim Assess the impact of the educational intervention on NH staff and therefore their confidence and competence in caring for residents at the end of life. Methods A longitudinal mixed method approach using 3 methods at baseline, 3 and 6 months: 1. A survey to all NH staff incorporating a self-efficacy palliative care scale (SEPC) to rate confidence on a 10 point Likert scale (Mason and Ellershaw, 2004). 2. Pre and post intervention semi-structured interviews with the staff participating in the T2C educational intervention. 3. Focus group of hospice staff 6 months post T2C educational intervention. Results At 6 months confidence increased and was sustained in all aspects of end of life care but most markedly in communication and symptom control. Confidence decreased in NH staff not undertaking the education intervention indicating work to do in peer learning. Conclusion A palliative care educational intervention can increase confidence and competence in NH staff to care for residents in a NH so reduce risk of unplanned hospital admission. Reference .

abstract={Introduction: Intra-articular steroid injection (IASI) is commonly used in the emergency department for management of osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms. Hip IASI carries risks, such as avascular necrosis, and there is currently no reliable way to predict long-term response of a patient's OA to IASI. Ultrasound (US) conveniently assesses for active arthropathy by detecting effusion-synovitis, and x-ray (XR) is useful for visualizing bone-related changes. We investigated the extent that a response to hip IASI could be predicted from baseline OA patient clinical and physical features alongside US and XR imaging features. Methods: 97 consenting patients with symptomatic hip OA presenting for hip IASI were evaluated at baseline (XR and US) and again 8-weeks after IASI (US only). Self-reported pain (WOMAC), hip range of motion (ROM) were measured at baseline and follow up. On US images we quantified joint effusion and synovial thickening, i.e., "effusion-synovitis", by the bone-capsule distance (BCD) at the apex of the femoral head from outer femoral cortex to outer synovium. On XR, we measured minimum joint space width (cm) and Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) Grade for osteophytes and sclerotic changes. Results: In our 97 patients (43 female) aged 28-87 years (mean 59+/-13 years, K-L grades averaged 2.5+/-1.5, and US BCD averaged 5.9+/-2.0 mm. We performed multiple linear regression using age, sex, BMI, ROM of hip flexion, US BCD, radiographic joint space width and K-L grade against the dependent variable, change in WOMAC pain subscore (R=0.587, P=0.002). We compared the response predicted by this model to the actual change in WOMAC pain. At a threshold value of -20% for minimal clinically important difference, 35/97 patients were responders, and a 2x2 table gave 67% overall model predictive accuracy, 61% sensitivity, and 71% specificity. Likelihood ratio for a positive response (LR+) was 2.13. Conclusion: Combining radiographic information on structural damage, US information on active arthropathy, and demographics correctly predicted about two-thirds of the patients that would benefit from IASI after 8 weeks. A patient with hip OA that met our model criteria was more than twice as likely to respond to IASI. With further model refinement, effective, personalized evidence-based management of symptomatic hip OA is possible using XR and hip US, which could both be performed during an ER visit.},

Descriptors: Nursing Care; Emergency Medical Services; Gastrointestinal Intubation; Treatment Time; Patient Safety. The positioning of the distal tip of the tube in an inadequate anatomical place can cause serious incidents or adverse events(5), such as the infusion of diet or medications into the respiratory tract(6-7).

abstract={The transcription factor E74-like factor 5 (ELF5) is a potent antioncogene that can prevent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in prostate cancer (PCa). However, little is known how it suppress the tumor growth and if it can interact with androgen receptor (AR). In this study, we find that the ELF5 is frequently expressed in AR activated PCa cells, where it binds to AR acting as a physiological partner and negatively regulates its transcriptional activity. In addition, the interaction between ELF5 and AR is androgen-dependent. Downregulation of ELF5 by shRNA increases the expression of AR-response genes and the progression of PCa. Moreover, ELF5 is a AR-dependent gene that its expression can be induced by androgen and suppressed by antiandrogen treatment. Notably, forced reduction of ELF5 in LNCaP cells facilitates the binding of AR to ARE in ELF5 gene and enabling its transcription, so that low level ELF5 can turn up its own expression by the negative feedback loop.},

abstract={Background & aims Acquisition of anoikis resistance is a prerequisite for metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about how energy metabolism and antioxidant systems are altered in anoikis-resistant (AR) HCC cells. We evaluated anti-tumor effects of a combination treatment of 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in AR HCC cells. Methods We compared glycolysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and chemoresistance among Huh-BAT, HepG2 HCC cells, and the corresponding AR cells. Expression of hexokinase II, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (rGCS), and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in AR cells was assessed. Anti-tumor effects of a combination treatment of 3-BP and BSO were evaluated in AR cells and an HCC xenograft mouse model. Results AR HCC cells showed significantly higher chemoresistance, glycolysis and lower ROS production than attached cells. Expression of hexokinase II, rGCS, and EMT markers was higher in AR HCC cells than attached cells. A combination treatment of 3-BP/BSO effectively suppressed proliferation of AR HCC cells through apoptosis by blocking glycolysis and enhancing ROS levels. In xenograft mouse models, tumor growth derived from AR HCC cells was significantly suppressed in the group treated with 3-BP/BSO compared to the group treated with 3-BP or sorafenib. Conclusions These results demonstrated that a combination treatment of 3-BP/BSO had a synergistic anti-tumor effect in an AR HCC model. This strategy may be an effective adjuvant therapy for patients with sorafenib-resistant HCC.},

abstract={Aim. To detect expression of EMT-related genes in prostate tumor samples and analyze a possible correlation between gene expression level and clinical characteristics of prostate cancer in different groups. Methods. Expression of 19 genes was analyzed in 37 frozen samples of prostate cancer tissues at different tumor stages and Gleason scores, 37 paired conventionally normal prostate tissues and 20 samples of prostate adenomas, using quantitative PCR. Results. We have found that nine genes were expressed differently in benign and malignant prostate tumors, namely AR (1 isof), AR (2 isof), PTEN, VIM, MMP9, KRT18, PCA3, HOTAIR and SCHLAP1. When different tumor stages were compared, we could identify six differentially expressed genes: KRT18, MMP9, VIM, PCA3, HOTAIR and SCHLAP1; when samples of tumors with different Gleason score were compared, we found that eight genes were expressed differently: AR (1isof), CDH1, KRT18, MMP9, OCLN, PCA3, HOTAIR and SCHLAP1. The data had a high level of heterogeneity pottentially due to various molecular subtypes of prostate cancer, i.e. a luminal subtype with ahigh expression of CDH1, OCLN, AR(1 isof), KRT18, NKX3-1 and PSA; the stem-like subtype with a high expression of mesenchymal markers CDH2, FN1 and VIM and low expression of the epithelial markers. It is noteworthy that lncRNAs were specifically expressed in these two molecular subtypes. Conclusions. EMT-related genes were differentially expressed in benign and malignant prostate tumors. High heterogeneity of expression levels, especially in adenocarcinoma groups, might suggest the existence of at least two different molecular subtypes, luminal and stem-like. Further experiments are necessary for specification of the molecular subtypes of prostate adenocarcinoma.Alternate abstract: Мета.

Відносні рівні експресії 19 генів у 37 заморожених зразках тканин раку передміхурової залози з різними показниками Глісона та стадіями пухлин, 37 парних умовно-нормальних зразків тканини передміхурової залози та 20 зразків аденоми простати було детектовано кількісною ПЛР (QPCR). Результати. Було виявлено 9 диференційно експресованих генів у доброякісних та злоякісних пухлинах простати: (AR (1 isof), AR (2 isof), PTEN, VIM, MMP9, KRT18, PCA3, HOTAIR, SCHLAP1). На різних стадіях раку виявлено 6 диференційно експресованих генів (KRT18, MMP9, VIM, PCA3, HOTAIR, SCHLAP1), а за різними оцінками Глісона виявлено 8 диференційно експресованих генів (AR (1 isof), CDH1, KRT18, MMP9, OCLN, PCA3, HOTAIR, SCHLAP1). Спостерігався значний рівень дисперсії даних. Це можна пояснити наявністю різних молекулярних підтипів раку передміхурової залози: люмінальний підтип (висока експресія CDH1, OCLN, AR (1 isof), KRT18, NKX3-1, PSA) і стовбуровий (базальний) підтип (висока експресія мезенхимальних маркерів CDH2, FN1, VIM і низька експресія епітеліальних маркерів). Досліджені некодуючі РНК були специфічно експресованіі у двох молекулярних підтипах. Висновки. пов'язані з ЕМП гени диференційно експресуються у доброякісних та злоякісних пухлинах передміхурової залози. Висока дисперсія даних експресії, особливо в групах аденокарциноми, може бути свідченням принаймні двох різних молекулярних підтипів: люмінального і стовбурового (базального). Нами продемонструвано, що умовно-нормальні тканини передміхурової залози не є адекватним контролем. Для уточнення молекулярних підтипів аденокарциноми передміхурової залози необхідні додаткові дослідження.Alternate abstract: Цель.

Методы. Относительные уровни экспрессии 19 генов в 37 замороженных образцах тканей рака предстательной железы с разными показателями Глисона и стадиями рака, 37 парных образцов условно-нормальной ткани простаты и 20 образцов аденомы предстательной железы были проанализированы с помощью количественной ПЦР (QPCR). Результаты. Было выявлено 9 дифференциально экспрессированных генов в доброкачественных и злокачественных опухолях предстательной железы: (AR (1 isof), AR (2 isof), PTEN, VIM, MMP9, KRT18, PCA3, HOTAIR, SCHLAP1). На разных стадиях рака были идентифицированы 6 дифференциально экспрессированных генов (KRT18, MMP9, VIM, PCA3, HOTAIR, SCHLAP1), тогда как с разными показателями по шкале Глисона было найдено 8 дифференциально экспрессированных генов (AR (1isof), CDH1, KRT18, MMP9, OCLN, PCA3, HOTAIR, SCHLAP1). Наблюдалась очень высокая дисперсия данных. Это может быть объяснено наличием различных молекулярных подтипов рака предстательной железы: люминального подтипа (высокая экспрессия CDH1, OCLN, AR (1 изоф), KRT18, NKX3-1, PSA) и стволового (базального) подтипа (высокая экспрессия мезенхимальных маркеров CDH2, FN1, VIM и низкая экспрессия эпителиальных маркеров). Исследованные некодирующие РНК специфически экспрессировались в двух молекулярных подтипах. Выводы. Гены, связанные с ЭМП, были дифференциально экспрессированы в доброкачественных и злокачественных опухолях предстательной железы. Высокая дисперсия данных экспрессии, особенно в группе аденокарцином, может свидетельствовать, по меньшей мере, о двух разных молекулярных подтипах: люминальном и базальном.

abstract={Some 21 million adults and children are labor-trafficked or sex-trafficked through force, fraud, or coercion. In recognition of the interface between trafficking victims and the healthcare setting, over the last 10 years there has been a notable increase in training of health care professionals (HCPs) on human trafficking (HT) and its health implications. Many organizations have developed curricula and offered training in various clinical settings. However, methods and content of this education on trafficking vary widely, and there is little evaluation of the impact of the training. The goal of this study was to assess the gaps and strengths in HT education of HCPs in the US. This mixed-method study had two components. The first component consisted of structured interviews with experts in human trafficking HCP education. The second portion of the study involved an analysis of data from HCP calls to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC). The interviews captured trainer-specific data on types of HT training, duration and frequency, key content areas, presence of evaluation approaches and indicators, as well as an assessment of barriers and strengths in HT training for HCP. NHTRC call database analysis demonstrated increasing trends since 2008 in calls by HCPs. Overall findings revealed the need for standardization of HT training content to assure correct information, trauma-informed and patient-centered care, and consistent messaging for HCPs. Evaluation metrics for HT training need to be developed to demonstrate behavior change and impact on service delivery and patient-centered outcomes for HT victims, according to our proposed adapted Kirkpatrick’s Pyramid model. HT training and evaluation would benefit from an agency or institution at the national level to provide consistency and standardization of HT training content as well as to guide a process that would develop metrics for evaluation and the building of an evidence base.Abbreviations: AAP: American Academy of Pediatrics; ACF: Administration for Children and Families; CME: Continuing medical education; ED: Emergency department; HCP: Health care professional; HEAL: Health, Education, Advocacy, and Linkage; HHS: United States Department of Health and Human Services; HT: Human trafficking; IOM: United States Institute of Medicine; MH: Mental health; NHTRC: National Human Trafficking Resource Center; SOAR: Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Training},

abstract={AimNational Early Warning Score (NEWS)1 has been shown to be the best early warning score to predict in-hospital mortality.2 A single study also supports it’s use in a prehospital setting.3 The aim of the current retrospective cohort study was to investigate the association of prehospital NEWS and mortality using large population based databases.MethodsWe analysed prehospital electronic patient record data to calculate NEWS values and compared these to national mortality data. We included all patient records for patients 18 years or older with sufficient prehospital data to calculate NEWS from 17 August 2008 to 18 December 2015 encountered by the emergency medical services (EMS) in the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Finland. The primary outcome measure was death within one day of EMS dispatch.Results35 845 cases were included. Mean age of patients was 65.8 years (SD 19.9 years). 47.5% of patients were male. Median NEWS was 3 (IQR 1–5). The primary outcome of death within one day of EMS dispatch occurred in 441 (1.2%) cases. The AUROC for primary outcome of death within one day was 0.502.ConclusionIn our retrospective cohort study, prehospital NEWS did not predict mortality within one day of EMS dispatch.Williams B, Alberti G, Ball C, Bell D, Binks R, Durham L.

abstract={In the clinic, approximately 30% of children with adenoid hypertrophy (AH) concomitant with allergic rhinitis (AR) report poor responses to intranasal steroids. To determine whether the combination of mometasone furoate (MF) and oxymetazoline (OXY) is more effective than either agent alone, we performed a two-stage, parallel, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, clinical trial with 240 AH children with concomitant perennial AR. During the first stage, all children were randomly assigned to the MF or control group for six weeks of treatment. During the second stage, the non-responders from stage one were randomly assigned to 4 groups for 8 weeks of treatment that involved receiving the following treatments: MF/OXY, MF/placebo, placebo/OXY, or placebo/placebo. During the first stage of treatment, 39% of the responders treated with MF achieved greater reductions in total and individual symptom scores than did those on placebo. During the second stage of treatment, the nasal congestion scores of the MF/OXY group significantly decreased. The adenoid/choana ratio of the MF/OXY-treated group decreased and the nasal volume increased significantly. Our results suggest that the combination of OXY and MF is effective and safe for the treatment of AH children with concomitant AR and has a rapid onset of action.},

abstract={Inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR) is a major target of prostate cancer (PCa) therapy. However, prolonged androgen deprivation results eventually in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) with metastasis and poor survival. Emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may facilitate castration-resistance and cancer metastasis in PCa. The human androgen-dependent, castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) cell line LNCaP and the CRPC cell line C4-2 are often used as a model system for human PCa. However, the role of the AR and the effect of AR antagonist (antiandrogen) treatment on the RNA expression of key factors of EMT including the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) DRAIC in PCa cells remain elusive. Although as expected the established AR target genes PSA and FKBP5 are strongly induced by androgens in both cell lines, both E-cadherin and vimentin mRNA levels are upregulated by androgens in LNCaP but not in C4-2 cells by short- and long-term treatments. The mRNA levels of E-cadherin and vimentin remain unchanged by antiandrogen treatment in both cell lines. The expression of transcription factors that regulate EMT including Slug, Snail and ZEB1 and the lncRNA DRAIC were affected by androgen treatment in both cell lines. The mRNA level of Slug is upregulated by androgens and interestingly downregulated by antiandrogens in both cell lines. On the other hand, ZEB1 mRNA levels are strongly upregulated by androgens but remain unchanged by antiandrogens. In contrast, Snail mRNA levels are repressed by androgen treatment similar to DRAIC RNA levels. However, while antiandrogen treatment seems not to change Snail mRNA levels, antiandrogen treatments induce DRAIC RNA levels. Moreover, despite the strong upregulation of Zeb1 mRNA, no significant increase of the ZEB1 protein was observed indicating that despite androgen upregulation, posttranscriptional regulation of EMT controlling transcription factors occurs. SLUG protein was enhanced in both cell lines by androgens and reduced by antiandrogens. Taken together, our data suggest that the ligand-activated AR regulates the expression of several EMT key factors and antiandrogens counteract AR activity only on selected genes.},

abstract={Issue Title: International Comparisons of Some Healthcare Delivery Impacts on Vulnerable Populations Legal universal health coverage is not enough for ensuring equal access to health care. If coverage is not effective for those requiring health services, additional measures shall be considered along with the existing mix of public and private health care providers. This paper aims to describe and discuss how health care services are delivered to low-income people in a mixed delivery system in Japan, where a combination of a statutory health insurance system and a public assistance program legally covers all residents. In the late twentieth century, the national government rather suppressed expansion of public providers but stimulated private provision. It also designates private providers as public-interest medical institutions to provide services that would not be paid sufficiently by the insurance system, e.g., rural health services and emergency medicine. Consequently, different public/private mixes in different specialties exist in different regions, although private providers are dominant overall and public providers are supposed to take various complementary roles that would not be achieved with the market. With the collectively exhaustive combination of mandatory insurance and public assistance, issues around access to health care for low-income people are often marginalized, despite increasing poverty. In reality, however, some of them are not able to pay insurance premiums and face high amounts of charges by losing their coverage at the point of services. Meanwhile, restrictive conditions of public assistance make it difficult for people on the border line to use health care with the program. After describing policy measures, including the Free/Low Cost Medical Care Program, to address these issues, the paper argues that one of the most critical issues is mainstreaming the issue of access to health care for those in need.},

abstract={Purpose Norepinephrine (NE) has been implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The goal of this study was to explore the effect of NE on cancer cell EMT and to investigate the potential mechanism. Methods HT-29 and A549 cells were treated with NE, beta]-adrenergic receptor (beta]-AR) antagonist (propranolol) or inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta] (TGF-beta]) receptor type I kinase (Ly2157299). Morphology of cells was observed with optical and electron microscope and immunofluorescence staining. Cellular migration and invasion were tested with transwell migration assay and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. TGF-beta]1 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were quantified. EMT markers and signaling pathway were measured by RT-PCR and western blot. Results NE stimulated TGF-beta]1 secretion and intracellular cAMP synthesis, induced morphological alterations in HT-29 and A549 cells, and enhanced their ability of migration and invasion. EMT markers induction was observed in NE-treated cancer cells. The effect of NE could be inhibited by propranolol or Ly2157299. beta]-AR/TGF-beta]1 signaling/p-Smad3/Snail and beta]-AR/TGF-beta]1 signaling/HIF-1alpha]/Snail were two signaling pathways. Conclusion These findings demonstrated that TGF-beta]1 signaling pathway was a significant factor of NE-induced cancer cells EMT. The data also suggested that psychological stress might be a risk factor which enhances the ability of migration or invasion of cancer cells.},

abstract={The communication infrastructure among various interconnected devices has revolutionized the process of collecting and sharing information. This evolutionary paradigm of collecting, storing and analyzing data streams is called the Internet of Everything (IoE). The information exchange through IoE is fast and accurate but leaves security issues. The emergence of IoE has seen a drift from a single novel technology to several technological developments. Managing various technologies under one infrastructure is complex especially when a network is openly allowing nodes to access it. Access transition of infrastructures from closed networked environments to the public internets has raised security issues. The consistent growth in IoE technology is recognized as a bridge between physical, virtual and cross-cultural worlds. Modern enterprises are becoming reliant on interconnected wireless intelligent devices and this has put billions of user’s data in risk. The interference and intrusion in any infrastructure have opened the door of public safety concerns because this interception could compromise the user’s personal data as well as personal privacy. This research aims to adopt a holistic approach to devising a secure IoE architecture for cross-culture communication organizations, with attention paid to the various technological wearable devices, their security policies, communication protocols, data format and data encryption features to avoid the data exploitation. A systems methodology will be adopted with a view to developing a secure IoE model which provides for a generic implementation after analyzing the critical security features to minimize the risk of data exploitations. This would combine the ability of IoE to connect, communicate, and remotely manage an incalculable number of networked, automated devices with the security properties of authentication, availability, integrity and confidentiality on a configurable basis. This will help clarify issues currently present and narrow down security threats planning considerably.},

abstract={Rapid and accurate assessment of the state of buildings in the aftermath of a disaster event is critical for an effective and timely response. For rapid damage assessment of buildings, the utility of remote sensing (RS) technology has been widely researched, with focus on a range of platforms and sensors. However, RS-based approaches still have limitations to assess structural integrity and the specific damage status of individual buildings. Structural integrity refers to the ability of a building to hold the entire structure. Consequently, ground-based assessment conducted by structural engineers and first responders is still required. This paper demonstrates the concept of mobile augmented reality (mAR) to improve performance of building damage and safety assessment in situ. Mobile AR provides a means to superimpose various types of reference or pre-disaster information (virtual data) on actual post-disaster building data (real buildings). To adopt mobile AR, this study defines a conceptual framework based on the level of complexity (LOC). The framework consists of four LOCs, and for each of these, the data types, required processing steps, AR implementation and use for damage assessment are described. Based on this conceptualization we demonstrate prototypes of mAR for both indoor and outdoor purposes. Finally, we conduct a user evaluation of the prototypes to validate the mAR approach for building damage and safety assessment.},

title={Context dependent regulatory patterns of the androgen receptor and androgen receptor target genes},
journal={BMC Cancer},
volume={16},
note={Copyright - Copyright BioMed Central 2016; Last updated - 2023-06-23},
abstract={Background Expression of the androgen receptor (AR) is associated with androgen-dependent proliferation arrest and terminal differentiation of normal prostate epithelial cells. Additionally, activation of the AR is required for survival of benign luminal epithelial cells and primary cancer cells, thus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) leads to apoptosis in both benign and cancerous tissue. Escape from ADT is known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In the course of CRPC development the AR typically switches from being a cell-intrinsic inhibitor of normal prostate epithelial cell proliferation to becoming an oncogene that is critical for prostate cancer cell proliferation. A clearer understanding of the context dependent activation of the AR and its target genes is therefore desirable. Methods Immortalized human prostate basal epithelial EP156T cells and progeny cells that underwent epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), primary prostate epithelial cells (PrECs) and prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, VCaP and 22Rv1 were used to examine context dependent restriction and activation of the AR and classical target genes, such as KLK3. Genome-wide gene expression analyses and single cell protein analyses were applied to study the effect of different contexts. Results A variety of growth conditions were tested and found unable to activate AR expression and transcription of classical androgen-dependent AR target genes, such as KLK3, in prostate epithelial cells with basal cell features or in mesenchymal type prostate cells. The restriction of androgen- and AR-dependent transcription of classical target genes in prostate basal epithelial cells was at the level of AR expression. Exogenous AR expression was sufficient for androgen-dependent transcription of AR target genes in prostate basal epithelial cells, but did not exert a positive feedback on endogenous AR expression. Treatment of basal prostate epithelial cells with inhibitors of epigenetic gene silencing was not efficient in inducing androgen-dependent transcription of AR target genes, suggesting the importance of missing cofactor(s). Conclusions Regulatory mechanisms of AR and androgen-dependent AR target gene transcription are insufficiently understood and may be critical for prostate cancer initiation, progression and escape from standard therapy. The present model is useful for the study of context dependent activation of the AR and its transcriptome.},

Based on this conceptualization we demonstrate prototypes of mAR for both indoor and outdoor purposes. Finally, we conduct a user evaluation of the prototypes to validate the mAR approach for building damage and safety assessment.},

abstract={Introduction The North East Department is a resource-limited region of Haiti. Health care is provided by hospitals and community clinics, with no formal Emergency Medical System and undefined emergency services. As a paucity of information exists on available emergency services in the North East Department of Haiti, the objective of this study was to assess systematically the existing emergency care resources in the region. Methods This cross-sectional observational study was carried out at all Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP)-affiliated hospitals in the North East Department and all clinics within the Fort Liberté district. A modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care and Generic Essential Emergency Equipment Lists were completed for each facility. Results Three MSPP hospitals and five clinics were assessed. Among hospitals, all had a designated emergency ward with 24 hour staffing by a medical doctor. All hospitals had electricity with backup generators and access to running water; however, none had potable water. All hospitals had x-ray and ultrasound capabilities. No computed tomography scanners existed in the region. Invasive airway equipment and associated medications were not present consistently in the hospitals' emergency care areas, but they were available in the operating rooms. Pulse oximetry was unavailable uniformly. One hospital had intermittently functioning defibrillation equipment, and two hospitals had epinephrine. Basic supplies for managing obstetrical and traumatic emergencies were available at all hospitals. Surgical services were accessible at two hospitals. No critical care services were available in the region. Clinics varied widely in terms of equipment availability. They uniformly had limited emergency medical equipment. The clinics also had inconsistent access to basic assessment tools (sphygmomanometers 20% and stethoscopes 60%). A protocol for transferring patients requiring a higher level of care was present in most (80%) clinics and one of the hospitals. However, no facility had a written protocol for transferring patients to other facilities. One hospital reported intermittent access to an ambulance for transfers. Conclusions Deficits in the supply of emergency equipment and limited protocols for inter-facility transfers exist in North East Department of Haiti. These essential areas represent appropriate targets for interventions aimed at improving access to emergency care within the North East region of Haiti.

abstract={The emerging role of stress-related signaling in regulating cancer development and progression has been recognized. However, whether stress serves as a mechanism to promote gastric cancer metastasis is not clear. Here, we show that the beta]^sub 2^-AR agonist, isoprenaline, upregulates expression levels of CD44 and CD44v8-10 in gastric cancer cells. CD44, a cancer stem cell-related marker, is expressed at high levels in gastric cancer tissues, which strongly correlates with the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated phenotypes both in vivo and in vitro. Combined with experimental observations in two human gastric cancer cell lines, we found that beta]^sub 2^-AR signaling can initiate EMT. It led to an increased expression of mesenchymal markers, such as alpha]-SMA, vimentin, and snail at mRNA and protein levels, and conversely a decrease in epithelial markers, E-cadherin and beta]-catenin. Isoprenaline stimulation of beta]2-AR receptors activates the downstream target STAT3, which functions as a positive regulator and mediated the phenotypic switch toward a mesenchymal cell type in gastric cancer cells. Our data provide a mechanistic understanding of the complex signaling cascades involving stress-related hormones and their effects on EMT. In light of our observations, pharmacological interventions targeting beta]^sub 2^-AR-STAT3 signaling can potentially be used to ameliorate stress-associated influences on gastric cancer development and progression.},

abstract={Taxane‐based chemotherapy is an effective treatment for castration‐resistant‐prostate cancer (CRPC) via stabilization of microtubules. Previous studies identified that the inhibitory effect of microtubule‐targeting chemotherapy on androgen receptor (AR) activity was conferred by interfering with AR intracellular trafficking. The N‐terminal domain (NTD) of AR was identified as a tubulin‐interacting domain that can be effectively targeted by the novel small molecule inhibitor, EPI. Taken together this evidence provided the rationale that targeting AR nuclear translocation and activity via a combination of an antagonist of the AR NTD and taxane‐based chemotherapy may enhance the therapeutic response in CRPC. The present study investigated the anti‐tumor efficacy of a combination of EPI with Docetaxel chemotherapy, in cell models of CRPC, harboring the AR splice variants in addition to the full length AR. Our findings demonstrate that there was no significant effect on the androgen‐mediated nuclear transport of AR variants and AR transcriptional activity by Docetaxel. The therapeutic response to Docetaxel was enhanced by inhibition of the NTD of AR (by EPI) through cycling of epithelial‐mesenchymal‐transition (EMT) to mesenchymal‐epithelial‐transition (MET) among prostate cancer epithelial cells. These results support that transient “programming” of EMT by the AR NTD inhibitor, potentially drives the sensitivity of prostate tumors with differential distribution of AR variants to microtubule‐targeting chemotherapy. This study is of major significance in dissecting mechanisms to overcome taxane resistance in advanced CRPC.},

abstract={Norepinephrine and epinephrine, catecholamine hormones that are major mediators for chronic stress‐induced cancers, are implicated in the progression of a number of cancer cells, including gastric adenocarcinoma. However, the underlying mechanisms of these hormones have not been well elucidated. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial event responsible for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The hypothesis regarding whether the promotive effects of norepinephrine (NE) on cancer are in part due to its ability to induce an EMT program has not been proven. In this study, we show that NE does not only obviously induce EMT alterations in the morphological characteristics of gastric adenocarcinoma cells, but also increases the markers of EMT, including vimentin expression, and decreases E‐cadherin expression, further resulting in cell motility and invasiveness. We also reveal that these actions are mainly mediated through the activation of β2‐AR–HIF‐1α–Snail signaling pathways. In summary, this study implies that NE induces EMT in gastric adenocarcinoma through the regulation of β2‐AR–HIF‐1α–Snail activity. The data provide a new perspective on chronic stress in a negative social and psychological state, which may be a risk factor for cancer development and progression.},

abstract={Doc number: 55 Abstract: An important clinical challenge in prostate cancer therapy is the inevitable transition from androgen-sensitive to castration-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer. Albeit the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis has been targeted, the biological mechanism underlying the lethal event of androgen independence remains unclear. New emerging evidences indicate that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) play crucial roles during the development of castration-resistance and metastasis of prostate cancer. Notably, EMT may be a dynamic process. Castration can induce EMT that may enhance the stemness of CSCs, which in turn results in castration-resistance and metastasis. Reverse of EMT may attenuate the stemness of CSCs and inhibit castration-resistance and metastasis. These prospective approaches suggest that therapies target EMT and CSCs may cast a new light on the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in the future. Here we review recent progress of EMT and CSCs in CRPC.},

abstract={Increased CCL2 expression in prostate cancer (PCa) cells enhanced metastasis via macrophage recruitment. However, its linkage to androgen receptor (AR)‐mediated PCa progression remains unclear. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized regulation: targeting AR with siRNA in PCa cells increased macrophage recruitment via CCL2 up‐regulation, which might then result in enhancing PCa invasiveness. Molecular mechanism dissection revealed that targeting PCa AR with siRNA promoted PCa cell migration/invasion via CCL2‐dependent STAT3 activation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways. Importantly, pharmacologic interruption of the CCL2/CCR2‐STAT3 axis suppressed EMT and PCa cell migration, providing a new mechanism linking CCL2 and EMT. Simultaneously targeting PCa AR with siRNA and the CCL2/CCR2‐STAT3 axis resulted in better suppression of PCa growth and metastasis in a xenograft PCa mouse model. Human PCa tissue microarray analysis suggests that increased CCL2 expression may be potentially associated with poor prognosis of PCa patients. Together, these results may provide a novel therapeutic approach to better battle PCa progression and metastasis at the castration resistant stage via the combination of targeting AR with siRNA and anti‐CCL2/CCR2‐STAT3 signalling.},

abstract={Background: It is unclear what constitutes a clinically meaningful response for allergic rhinitis (AR) outcomes. The objectives of these post hoc analyses were (1) to define a clinically meaningful response using novel efficacy analyses (including a responder analysis), and (2) to compare the efficacy of MP29-02 a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP)] with commercially available FP, AZE and placebo in seasonal AR (SAR) patients, using these novel analyses. Methods: 610 moderate-to-severe SAR patients (≥12 years old) were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-day, parallel-group trial. Change from baseline in the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 14 days was the primary outcome. Post hoc endpoints included the sum of nasal and ocular symptoms (rT7SS), efficacy by disease severity and by predominant nasal symptom, and a set of responder analyses. Results: MP29-02 most effectively reduced rT7SS (relative greater improvement: 52% to FP; 56% to AZE) and both nasal and ocular symptoms irrespective of severity. More MP29-02 patients achieved a ≥30, ≥50, ≥60, ≥75 and ≥90% rTNSS reduction, which occurred days faster than with either active comparator; MP29-02 alone was superior to placebo at the ≥60% (or higher) threshold. One in 2 MP29-02 patients achieved a ≥50% rTNSS reduction and 1 in 6 achieved complete/near-to-complete response. Only MP29-02 was consistently superior to placebo for all patients, whatever their predominant symptom. Conclusions: MP29-02 provided faster and more complete symptom control than first-line therapies. It was consistently superior irrespective of severity, response criteria or patient-type, and may be considered the drug of choice for moderate-to-severe AR. These measures define a new standard for assessing relevance in AR.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Background Long-term and unresolved airway inflammation and airway remodeling, characteristic features of chronic asthma, if not treated could lead to permanent structural changes in the airways. Aldose reductase (AR), an aldo-sugar and lipid aldehyde metabolizing enzyme, mediates allergen-induced airway inflammation in mice, but its role in the airway remodeling is not known. In the present study, we have examined the role of AR on airway remodeling using ovalbumin (OVA)-induced chronic asthma mouse model and cultured human primary airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs). Methods Airway remodeling in chronic asthma model was established in mice sensitized and challenged twice a week with OVA for 6 weeks. AR inhibitor, fidarestat, was administered orally in drinking water after first challenge. Inflammatory cells infiltration in the lungs and goblet cell metaplasia, airway thickening, collagen deposition and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in response to increasing doses of methacholine were assessed. The TGFβ1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SAECs and changes in mLFs were examined to investigate AR-mediated molecular mechanism(s) of airway remodeling. Results In the OVA-exposed mice for 6 wks inflammatory cells infiltration, levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, goblet cell metaplasia, collagen deposition and AHR were significantly decreased by treatment with AR inhibitor, fidarestat. Further, inhibition of AR prevented TGFβ1-induced altered expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin, Occludin, and MMP-2 in SAECs, and alpha-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin in mLFs. Further, in SAECs, AR inhibition prevented TGFβ1- induced activation of PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway but not the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that allergen-induced airway remodeling is mediated by AR and its inhibition blocks the progression of remodeling via inhibiting TGFβ1-induced Smad-independent and PI3K/AKT/GSK3β-dependent pathway.},

abstract={The wireless communication systems are applied in different applications such as computers, mobile phones, satellites and antennas for off-body communication. A lot of efforts were made to have the antennas in a smaller size, flat and with better performance. In the last decade the rigid antennas are replaced with textile in order to be flexible and to be integrated into garments in order to have wearable textile systems. The textile antennas can find use in medical, military and first responders monitoring. The conductivity of the antennas can be achieved by using coated textile materials which are available in the market, conductive threads for embroidery or conductive inks. When using the conductive coated textile it is necessary to cut the patch in the desired pattern but using a simple cutting tool sometimes is not very precise and accurate. Thus in our study we decide to screen print with silver conductive inks on Polyester and Cotton/Polyester substrates. The screen printed antennas are than washed in order to conform that antennas for off-body communication integrated in garments can be easily washed five times.},

abstract={Objective To describe the natural history of phenotype, growth and gonadal function in patients with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. Setting Tertiary paediatric endocrine centre. Methods Retrospective evaluation of 14 male patients with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) with verified androgen receptor (AR) mutations. The authors recorded phenotypic characteristics at birth and external masculinisation score (EMS), registered longitudinal growth, circulating levels of testosterone, estradiol, luteinising hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin-B and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), in addition to phenotype at postpubertal follow up. Results The EMS ranged from 5 to 12 in PAIS at birth. Six patients were born with hypospadias and all patients developed gynaecomastia in puberty. Eight of the patients received testosterone treatment. At follow-up penile size was impaired irrespective of EMS at birth, but responded to pubertal androgen therapy in some of the patients. Serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, SHBG and LH, but not FSH and inhibin B, were markedly elevated in puberty. Final height was 181.3 cm (165.7-190.5 cm) corresponding to an SD score of 0.7 (-2.1 to +2.1 SD, n=10). Conclusion Gynaecomastia and impaired phallic growth are frequently observed in adults with PAIS, but may be ameliorated by androgen therapy. The authors suggest that male patients presenting with gynaecomastia in puberty, and elevated circulating levels of testosterone, estradiol and LH in puberty, but normal FSH, should be suspected of having PAIS and undergo genetic testing for AR mutations.},

abstract={Quetiapine (Seroquel®) is an orally administered atypical antipsychotic that is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression. An extended-release (XR) formulation of quetiapine is also available. This review summarizes the pharmacological properties, efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine and quetiapine XR in patients with bipolar depression. Quetiapine is an antagonist at both serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors, and its antipsychotic effects are thought to stem from interactions at these receptors. The antidepressant effects of quetiapine are poorly understood, but may be related to antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors in cortical regions, partial agonism of 5-HT1A in the prefrontal cortex in association with increased extracellular dopamine release in the region, or to reduced synaptic reuptake of noradrenaline resulting from inhibition of the noradrenaline reuptake transporter by the quetiapine metabolite norquetiapine. The efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine was evaluated in five 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre or multinational trials in patients with a major depressive episode (MDE) associated with bipolar disorder. Across trials, monotherapy with oral quetiapine 300 or 600 mg/day (or quetiapine XR 300 mg/day) produced significantly greater improvements than placebo in depressive symptoms (primary endpoint), according to the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. In general, quetiapine and quetiapine XR were also associated with significantly higher MDE response and remission rates than placebo. Across trials, quetiapine and quetiapine XR produced significantly greater improvements in global severity of illness scores than placebo, according to changes in the Clinical Global Impressions scale score. There were no differences in treatment outcomes between quetiapine 300 mg/day and 600 mg/day dosage groups. Patients with bipolar depression who responded to quetiapine during two 8-week acute treatment trials also benefited from continuing quetiapine therapy for up to 52 weeks. Compared with quetiapine responders randomized to placebo, quetiapine responders who continued quetiapine 300 or 600 mg/day had a significantly reduced risk of recurrence of any mood events and of depression mood events, but not of hypomanic/manic events. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, quetiapine maintenance therapy for up to 104 weeks was more efficacious than placebo or lithium in prolonging the time to recurrence of any mood event (primary endpoint). Patients in this trial had bipolar I disorder with mania, depression or a mixed episode as the index episode, and the trial included only patients who were responsive to acute phase quetiapine, which may have introduced a positive bias in favour of quetiapine over lithium during maintenance therapy. Quetiapine 300 or 600 mg/day and quetiapine XR 300 mg/day was generally well tolerated in patients with bipolar depression, with most treatment-emergent adverse events being of mild to moderate severity. The most frequent adverse events occurring during the acute treatment phase were dry mouth, sedation, somnolence, dizziness (quetiapine and quetiapine XR), constipation (quetiapine) and increased appetite (quetiapine XR). Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) occurred across quetiapine and placebo groups, but there were no significant differences between quetiapine and placebo recipients on objective measures of EPS and akathisia. In some trials, quetiapine recipients experienced significantly greater weight gain than placebo recipients. Across trials, some quetiapine recipients had clinically relevant increases in blood glucose or lipid parameters, although these also occurred in patients from other treatment groups. The clinical significance of these changes is uncertain. In conclusion, quetiapine and quetiapine XR are valuable additions to the first-line treatments for bipolar depression. Further head-to-head trials of quetiapine versus other drug regimens that are effective in bipolar depression would be of considerable interest. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Multiple mechanisms have been described for coordination of responses to the plant hormones auxin and brassinosteroids (Zhang et al., 2009). One unexplained phenomenon is the reliance of the auxin transcriptional response on a functional brassinosteroid pathway. In this study, we used luciferase reporters to interrogate the promoter of SMALL AUXIN-UP RNA15 (SAUR15), a well-characterized auxin and brassinosteroid early response gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). After identifying a minimal region sufficient for auxin response, we targeted predicted cis-regulatory elements contained within this sequence and found a critical subset required for hormone response. Specifically, reporter sensitivity to auxin treatment required two elements: a Hormone Up at Dawn (HUD)-type E-box and an AuxRE-related TGTCT element. Reporter response to brassinosteroid treatment relied on the same two elements. Consistent with these findings, the transcription factors BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-EMS SUPPESSOR1 and MONOPTEROS (MP)/ AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR5 (ARF5) showed enhanced binding to the critical promoter region containing these elements. Treatment with auxin or brassinosteroids could enhance binding of either transcription factor, and brassinosteroid enhancement of MP/ARF5 binding required an intact HUD element. Conservation of clustered HUD elements and AuxRE-related sequences in promoters of putative SAUR15 orthologs in a number of flowering plant species, in combination with evidence for statistically significant clustering of these elements across all Arabidopsis promoters, provided further evidence of the functional importance of coordinated transcription factor binding.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue on Personal Projection The support of realistic and flexible training simulations for military, law enforcement, emergency response, and other domains has been an important motivator for the development of augmented reality technology. An important vision for achieving this goal has been the creation of a versatile "stage" for physical, emotional, and cognitive training that combines virtual characters and environments with real world elements, such as furniture and props. This paper presents REFLCT, a mixed reality projection framework that couples a near-axis personal projector design with tracking and novel retroreflective props and surfaces. REFLCT provides multiple users with personalized, perspective-correct imagery that is uniquely composited for each user directly into and onto a surrounding environment, without any optics positioned in front of the user's eyes or face. These characteristics facilitate team training experiences which allow users to easily interact with their teammates while wearing their standard issue gear. REFLCT can present virtual humans who can make deictic gestures and establish eye contact without the geometric ambiguity of a typical projection display. It can also display perspective-correct scenes that require a realistic approach for detecting and communicating potential threats between multiple users in disparate locations. In addition to training applications, this display system appears to be well matched with other user interface and application domains, such as asymmetric collaborative workspaces and personal information guides.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={A decrease in blood hydrogen ions (H+) may allow for the recovery of a muscle, which should allow for greater performance in subsequent activity. The purpose of this study was to determine which of 3 forms of recovery were the most effective after an inning of pitching in baseball. Three different measurements were used to determine which recovery method was most effective; the difference in blood lactate (BLa) levels was used as a biological measurement, average pitching speed was the physiological measurement, and the psychological measurement was done on how the pitchers perceived their pitching and recovery. The recovery methods that were used were passive recovery (PR), active recovery (AR), and electromuscular stimulation (EMS). Seven college men aged 21 (±2 years) who were National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II college baseball pitchers were assessed during game play simulations. Blood lactate levels decreased significantly from the premeasurement to the postmeasurement with the EMS recovery method (p < 0.0005); however, BLa did not change for PR (p = 0.017) or AR (p = 0.134). Perceived recovery was also found to be best in the EMS and PR conditions. These findings suggest that EMS is an effective recovery method between innings of pitching. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Androgen receptors (ARs) which are implicated in the pathogenesis of several malignancies can also be a possible downstream effector in laryngeal cancer. In the present study, 97 invasive squamous laryngeal carcinomas were studied by immunohistochemistry for protein expression of AR. Androgen receptors were expressed in 52.6% of tumor specimens, suggesting their implication in the pathogenesis of this tumor. Our study's aim was to investigate the hypothetical scenario of an androgen refractory laryngeal carcinoma where androgen receptors can be activated by nodal molecules in the course of an Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon. In line with this we correlated AR expression with the expression of ILK, p-Akt, E-cadherin, β-catenin in our sample as well as with tumor grade and TNM stage. A reverse correlation between nuclear AR and cytoplasmic ILK expression was evidenced, indicating an interaction of those molecules in laryngeal carcinoma. Finally in our material, in those carcinomas that were expressing ARs, stronger nuclear expression of the receptor was characterized by poorer cell differentiation and correlated with the acquisition of EMT features like E-cadherin loss and β-catenin translocation raising a question whether activated ARs can drive an EMT procedure.},

abstract={Zinc-finger enhancer binding protein (ZEB1) is a transcription factor involved in the progression of cancer primarily through promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ZEB1 represses the expression of E-cadherin by binding to E-box sequences in the promoter, thus decreasing epithelial differentiation. We show that ZEB1 and androgen receptor (AR) cross-talk in triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that ZEB1 binds directly to the E-box located in the AR promoter. ZEB1 suppression by stably transfecting shRNA in a triple negative breast cancer cell line resulted in a decrease of AR mRNA, protein, and AR downstream targets. ZEB1 knockdown in triple negative breast cancer cells sensitized the cells to bicalutamide by reducing migration compared to the control cells. Conversely, blockade of AR signaling with bicalutamide resulted in a suppression of ZEB1 protein expression in two triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, using a breast cancer tissue microarray, a majority of triple negative breast cancers exhibit positive staining for both ZEB1 and AR. Taken together, these results indicate that ZEB1 and AR regulate each other to promote cell migration in triple negative breast cancer cells. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (Guest Editors: Erik W. Thompson and Elizabeth Williams) Androgen refractory cancer of the prostate (ARCaP) cells contain androgen receptor (AR) and synthesize and secrete prostate specific antigen (PSA). We isolated epithelia-like ARCaPE from parental ARCaP cells and induced them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by exposing these cells to soluble factors including TGFβ1 plus EGF, IGF-1, β2-microglobulin (β2-m), or a bone microenvironment. The molecular and behavioral characteristics of the resultant ARCaPM were characterized extensively in comparison to the parental ARCaPE cells. In addition to expressing mesenchymal biomarkers, ARCaPM gained 100% incidence of bone metastasis. ARCaPM cells express receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which was shown to increase tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts in culture, and when metastatic to bone in vivo. We provide evidence that RANKL expression was promoted by increased cell signaling mediated by the activation of Stat3-Snail-LIV-1. RANKL expressed by ARCaPM cells is functional both in vitro and in vivo. The lesson we learned from the ARCaP model of EMT is that activation of a specific cell signaling pathway by soluble factors can lead to increased bone turnover, mediated by enhanced RANKL expression by tumor cells, which is implicated in the high incidence of prostate cancer bone colonization. The ARCaP EMT model is highly attractive for developing new therapeutic agents to treat prostate cancer bone metastasis. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In recent studies, we showed that murine fetal liver cells from progeny exposed to benzo(alpha)pyrene in utero by intraperitoneal injection of the dam at midpregnancy (12 d) suppressed cell proliferation in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response. On the other hand, fetal liver cells from the corn oil (vehicle for the carcinogen)-exposed progeny (control) appeared to enhance proliferation. Suppression or enhancement appeared to be mediated by fetal liver bearing CD8+ and Lyt 1+ (CD5+) cells. Despite these manifestations, the role of third-party cells needs to be considered. As a first premise, adherent cells were targeted as possible third-party cells. To test the role of the adherent cells, liver cells from benzo(alpha)pyrene-exposed fetuses were treated with ficoll-hypaque, and the interface cells were fractionated through glass wool or nylon wool. It is known that adhering cells, macrophages and B cells, readily attach to glass or nylon wool. The effluent cells and the adherent cells were cultured with syngeneic responder cells and allogeneic stimulator cells in a mixed lymphocyte response. The results showed that benzo(alpha)pyrene-effluent cells led to the enhancement of proliferation in the mixed lymphocyte response, while benzo(alpha)pyrene-adherent cells led to suppression. The effluent and adherent cells of corn oil controls did not modify cell proliferation in the mixed lymphocyte response. These data suggest that a third-party cell, reasonably the macrophage or possibly B cells or both, since these are adherent cells, play a decided role in mediating suppression in the benzo(alpha)pyrene-exposed progeny.},

abstract={Objective: We examined whether spatialized nonspeech beacons could guide navigation and how sound timbre, waypoint capture radius, and practice affect performance. Background: Auditory displays may assist mobility and wayfinding for those with temporary or permanent visual impairment, but they remain understudied. Previous systems have used speech-based interfaces. Method: Participants (108 undergraduates) navigated three maps, guided by one of three beacons (pink noise, sonar ping, or 1000-Hz pure tone) spatialized by a virtual reality engine. Dependent measures were efficiency of time and path length. Results: Overall navigation was very successful, with significant effects of practice and capture radius, and interactions with beacon sound. Overshooting and subsequent hunting for waypoints was exacerbated for small radius conditions. A human-scale capture radius (1.5 m) and sonar-like beacon yielded the optimal combination for safety and efficiency. Conclusion: The selection of beacon sound and capture radius depend on the specific application, including whether speed of travel or adherence to path are of primary concern. Extended use affects sound preferences and quickly leads to improvements in both speed and accuracy. Application: These findings should lead to improved wayfinding systems for the visually impaired as well as for first respondent (e.g., firefighters) and soldiers. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Prostate cancer usually transfers to bone. Bone metastases are related to pathologic fracture, pain, and reduced survival. There are many known targets for prostate cancer treatment, including androgen receptor (AR) axis, but drug resistance and metastasis eventually develop in advanced disease, suggesting the necessity to better understand the resistance mechanisms and consider multi-target medical treatment. Because of the limitations of approved treatments, further research into other potential targets is necessary. Metastasis is an important marker of cancer development, involving numerous factors, such as AKT, EMT, ECM, tumor angiogenesis, the development of inflammatory tumor microenvironment, and defect in programmed cell death. In tumor metastasis, programmed cell death (autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis) plays a key role. Malignant cancer cells have to overcome the different forms of cell death to transfer. The article sums up the recent studies on the mechanism of bone metastasis involving key regulatory factors such as macrophages and AKT and further discusses as to how regulating autophagy is crucial in relieving prostate cancer bone metastasis.},

abstract={Covid19 pandemic caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus2 is continuously spreading all over the world. The impact of covid19 has been fallen on almost all sectors of development including retail which plays a major role in day to day life. In this paper, we proposed an efficient methodology to create a safe environment of people in retail that contributes to public safety. The proposed smart retail system is focused on the real time monitoring of shopping malls which includes grocery, departmental stores, clothing shops, jewellery shops and shops with food essential products. At first a Mobile Application is developed using Android Studio for prebooking of shopping by users/customers. Using Anaconda Navigator a deep learning trained architecture is developed on distinguishing people with and without face mask. A wearable device is developed using ultra wide band radio technology to ensure safe social distancing which would alert customers as soon as the violation of social distancing is detected. The smart retail system also includes IoT based smart shopping cart with RFID sensors for the customers to check for the availability of items in the web server via Nodemcu and for automatic bill payment. The proposed methodology is also suitable for Religious places, Cinema Theatre, Training centres and Browsing centres.},

abstract={Prostate cancer (PCa) mortality remains a significant public health problem, as advanced disease has poor survivability due to the development of resistance in response to both standard and novel therapeutic interventions. Therapeutic resistance is a multifaceted problem involving the interplay of a number of biological mechanisms including genetic, signaling, and phenotypic alterations, compounded by the contributions of a tumor microenvironment that supports tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis. The androgen receptor (AR) is a primary regulator of prostate cell growth, response and maintenance, and the target of most standard PCa therapies designed to inhibit AR from interacting with androgens, its native ligands. As such, AR remains the main driver of therapeutic response in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), in combination with microtubule-targeting taxane chemotherapy, offers survival benefits in patients with mCRPC, therapeutic resistance invariably develops, leading to lethal disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance is critical to improving therapeutic outcomes and also to the development of biomarker signatures of predictive value. The interconversions between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) navigate the prostate tumor therapeutic response, and provide a novel targeting platform in overcoming therapeutic resistance. Both microRNA (miRNA)- and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms have been associated with epigenetic changes in prostate cancer. This review discusses the current evidence-based knowledge of the role of the phenotypic transitions and novel molecular determinants (non-coding RNAs) as contributors to the emergence of therapeutic resistance and metastasis and their integrated predictive value in prostate cancer progression to advanced disease.},

abstract={Simple SummaryDespite an intensive research effort in the past few decades, prostate cancer (PC) remains a top cause of cancer death in men, particularly in the developed world. The major cause of fatality is the progression of local prostate cancer to metastasis disease. Treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) is generally ineffective. Based on the discovery of mPC relying on androgen for growth, many patients with mPC show an initial response to the standard of care: androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, lethal castration resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs) commonly develop. It is widely accepted that intervention of metastatic progression of PC is a critical point of intervention to reduce PC death. Accumulative evidence reveals a role of RKIP in suppression of PC progression towards mPC. We will review current evidence and discuss the potential utilization of RKIP in preventing mPC progression.AbstractProstate cancer (PC) is a major cause of cancer death in men. The disease has a great disparity in prognosis. Although low grade PCs with Gleason scores ≤ 6 are indolent, high-risk PCs are likely to relapse and metastasize. The standard of care for metastatic PC (mPC) remains androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Resistance commonly occurs in the form of castration resistant PC (CRPC). Despite decades of research efforts, CRPC remains lethal. Understanding of mechanisms underpinning metastatic progression represents the overarching challenge in PC research. This progression is regulated by complex mechanisms, including those regulating PC cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Among this PC metastatic network lies an intriguing suppressor of PC metastasis: the Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). Clinically, the RKIP protein is downregulated in PC, and showed further reduction in mPC. In xenograft mouse models for PC, RKIP inhibits metastasis. In vitro, RKIP reduces PC cell invasion and sensitizes PC cells to therapeutic treatments. Mechanistically, RKIP suppresses Raf-MEK-ERK activation and EMT, and modulates extracellular matrix. In return, Snail, NFκB, and the polycomb protein EZH2 contribute to inhibition of RKIP expression. In this review, we will thoroughly analyze RKIP’s tumor suppression actions in PC.},

abstract={Price forecasting (PF) is the primary concern in distributed power generation. This paper presents a novel and improved technique to forecast electricity prices. The data of various power producers, Capacity Purchase Price (CPP), Power Purchase Price (PPP), Tariff rates, and load demand from National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) are considered for MAPE reduction in PF. Eight time-series and auto-regression algorithms are developed for data fetching and setting the objective function. The feed-forward ANFIS based on the ML approach and space vector regression (SVR) is introduced to PF by taking the input from time series and auto-regression (AR) algorithms. Best-feature selection is conducted by adopting the Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA)-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach that ultimately minimizes the complexity and computational time of the model. The proposed integration strategy computes the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the overall improvement percentage is 9.24%, which is valuable in price forecasting of the energy management system (EMS). In the end, EMS based on the Firefly algorithm (FA) has been presented, and by implementing FA, the cost of electricity has been reduced by 21%, 19%, and 20% for building 1, 2, and 3, respectively.},

abstract={The dysregulation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a critical event in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) and hormone therapy consisting of androgen deprivation (ADT) or AR inhibition is therefore used to treat advanced cases. It is known that N-cadherin becomes upregulated following ADT and can directly induce PCa transformation to the castration-resistant stage (CRPC). However, the relationship between AR and N-cadherin is unclear and may promote better understanding of CRPC pathogenesis and progression. Here, we demonstrate a new axis of N-cadherin/c-Jun/N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) that N-cadherin promotes c-Jun expression and suppresses NDRG1 to promote invasion and migration of PCa cells through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Targeting N-cadherin in combination with enzalutamide (ENZ) treatment synergistically suppressed PC3 cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Further studies showed that compared to lower Gleason score (GS) (GS 7) cases exhibited elevated N-cadherin expression and reduced NDRG1 expression, corroborating our in vitro observations. We further demonstrate that c-Jun, AR, and DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) form a complex in the 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response elements (TREs) region of the NDRG1 promoter, which suppresses NDRG1 transcription through DNA hypermethylation. In conclusion, we demonstrate an underlying mechanism for how N-cadherin collaborates with AR and NDRG1 to promote CRPC progression. Controlling N-cadherin/c-Jun/NDRG1 axis may help to overcome resistance to commonly used hormone therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes.},

To benefit from these safety and health prognostic opportunities, research efforts have explored the applicability of these devices to control workers’ wellbeing levels during occupational activities. A systematic review is proposed to summarise up-to-date progress in applying physiological monitoring systems for occupational groups. Adhering with the PRISMA Statement, five databases were searched from 2014 to 2021, and 12 keywords were combined, concluding with the selection of 38 articles. Sources of risk of bias were assessed regarding randomisation procedures, selective outcome reporting and generalisability of results. Assessment procedures involving non-invasive methods applied with health and safety-related goals were filtered. Working-age participants from homogeneous occupational groups were selected, with these groups primarily including firefighters and construction workers. Research objectives were mainly directed to assess heat stress and physiological workload demands. Heart rate related variables, thermal responses and motion tracking through accelerometry were the most common approaches. Overall, wearable sensors proved to be valid tools for assessing physiological status in working environments. Future research should focus on conducting sensor fusion assessments, engaging wearables in real-time evaluation methods and giving continuous feedback to workers and practitioners.},

abstract={Background. Clear cell renal cancer (KIRC) is one of the most common cancers globally, with a poor prognosis. TLRs play a vital role in anticancer immunity and the regulation of the biological progress of tumour cells. However, the precise role of TLRs in KIRC is still ambiguous. Methods. Various bioinformatics analysis and clinical validation of tissues were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of TLRs and their correlation with immune infiltration in KIRC. Results. The expression of TLR2/3/7/8 was increased at both mRNA and protein levels in KIRC. TLRs in KIRC were involved in the activation of apoptosis, EMT, RAS/MAPK, and RTK pathways, as well as the inhibition of the cell cycle and the hormone AR pathway. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that high expression of TLR3 and low expression of TLR7/9/10 were resistant to most of the small molecules or drugs from CTRP. Enrichment analyses showed that TLRs were mainly involved in innate immune response, toll-like receptor signalling pathway, NF-kappa B signalling pathway, and TNF signalling pathway. Furthermore, a high-level TLR3 expression was associated with a favourable prognosis in KIRC. Validation research further confirmed that TLR3 expression was increased in KIRC tissues, and high TLR3 levels were associated with poor overall survival. Moreover, TLR3 in KIRC showed a positive association with an abundance of immune cells, including B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, macrophage, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and the expression of the immune biomarker sets. Several TLR3-associated kinase, miRNA, or transcription factor targets were also identified in KIRC. Conclusion. Our results indicate that TLR3 serves as a prognostic biomarker and associated with immune infiltration in KIRC. This work lays a foundation for further studies on the role of TLR3 in the carcinogenesis and progression of KIRC.},

abstract={Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancers in North American men. While androgen deprivation has remained as the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment, resistance ensues leading to lethal disease. Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) encodes a pioneer factor that induces open chromatin conformation to allow the binding of other transcription factors. Through direct interactions with the Androgen Receptor (AR), FOXA1 helps to shape AR signaling that drives the growth and survival of normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. FOXA1 also possesses an AR-independent role of regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In prostate cancer, mutations converge onto the coding sequence and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of FOXA1, leading to functional alterations. In addition, FOXA1 activity in prostate cancer can be modulated post-translationally through various mechanisms such as LSD1-mediated protein demethylation. In this review, we describe the latest discoveries related to the function and regulation of FOXA1 in prostate cancer, pointing to their relevance to guide future clinical interventions.},

While such models may be useful for scenarios that involve static operators, they may not apply in real-world situations where operators are performing tasks under varying levels of physical activity, such as first responders, firefighters, and police officers. Here, we describe WAUC, a multimodal database of mental (Workload Assessment Under physical aCtivity). The study involved 48 participants who performed the NASA Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery II under three different activity level conditions. Physical activity was manipulated by changing the speed of a stationary bike or a treadmill. During data collection, six neurophysiological modalities were recorded, namely: electroencephalography, electrocardiography, breathing rate, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and blood volume pulse, in addition to 3-axis accelerometry. Moreover, participants were asked to answer the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire after each experimental section, as well as rate their physical fatigue level on the Borg fatigue. In order to bring our experimental setup closer to real-world situations, all signals were monitored using wearable, off-the-shelf devices. In this paper, we describe the adopted experimental protocol, as well as validate the subjective and neurophysiological data collected. The WAUC database, including the raw data and features, subjective ratings, and scripts to reproduce the experiments reported herein will be made available at http://musaelab.ca/resources/.},

abstract={The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) came into force in 1953 to guarantee specific rights and freedoms for people in countries that belong to the Council of Europe and to protect their human rights and prohibit unfair and harmful practices.1 COVID-19 took the world by storm and invaded all aspects of humanity. The powers available to public authorities under Article 5(1)(e) of the ECHR to lawfully detain people for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases were imposed by governments across Europe with the consequence that health and law enforcement agencies acquired powers to confine otherwise healthy individuals to their homes and to isolate and screen individuals suspected to have contracted COVID-19 using powers under Article 5(1)(b) of the ECHR.3 The promotion of powers under Article 5(1)(e) of the ECHR did not seem to have been extended to the promotion of provisions of Article 5(4) of the same convention, which allows for everyone deprived of their liberty by arrest or detention to be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of their detention shall be decided speedily by a court and their release ordered if the detention is not lawful. There were concerns about issues relating to the blanket approach taken to writing ‘DNAR’ (do not resuscitate) on the notes of older adults and people with intellectual disabilities without proper consultation4 in disregard of their Article 8 rights.5 There were also problems with the supply and availability of personal protective equipment6 to health and care professionals, with consequence on the human rights of workers7 to be protected from toxic exposures at work.8 There were concerns that the exigencies of the pandemic had the potential to cause doctors to consider factors such as the availability and capacity of current resources9 when making decisions about whether to continue life-saving treatment on an individual with a potential scenario where an individual could be deprived of continued treatment, consequently interfering with their Article 2 rights.10 A Court of Protection judgment11 considered the interface between the right to private and family life (Article 8), right to liberty and security (Article 5) and right to life (Article 2) among others, and drew out the primacy of absolute rights under ECHR such as Article 2 rights over qualified and limited rights (Article 8 and Article 5 rights, respectively).},

abstract={Matching sketch facial images to mug-shot images have crucial significance in law enforcement and digital entertainment. Conventional methods always assume that both the sketch and photo face images have the same resolutions. However, in real criminal detection, the target facial sketches obtained by the artist usually have different resolutions against the source photos in the mug-shot database. In this paper, we propose a locality-constrained feature space learning (LCFSL) method to address the above cross-resolution sketch-photo facial images matching problem. The proposed LCFSL approach not only build bridge to associate cross-domain face images, but also can learn resolution robust representation features for cross-resolution sketch-photo face recognition purpose. After common feature space learning, we simply use nearest neighbor classifier to perform recognition based on the projected features obtained from sketch-photo faces with different resolutions. Experiments conducted on CUHK student database and AR database have shown the effectiveness and superiority of our method to some state-of-the-art face recognition approaches.},

abstract={Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology. While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients. The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients. This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services. Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures. The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations. In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit (ICU) colleagues. The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff. In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.},

abstract={Objectives The Korean government has been providing financial support to open and operate the maternal hospital in Obstetrically Underserved Areas (OUAs) since 2011. Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of the government-support program for OUAs and to suggest future directions for it. Methods We performed sequential-mixed method approach. Descriptive analyses and multi-level logistic regression were performed based on the 2015 Korean National Health Insurance claim data. Data for the qualitative analysis were obtained from in-depth interviews with health providers and mothers in OUAs. Results Descriptive analyses indicated that the share of babies born in the hospitals located in the area among total babies ever born from mothers residing in the area (Delivery concentration Index: DCI) was lower in government-supported OUAs than other areas. Qualitative analyses revealed that physical distance is no longer a barrier in current OUAs. Mothers travel to neighboring big cities to seek elective preferences only available at specialized maternal hospitals rather than true medical need. Increasing one-child families changed the mother’s perception of pregnancy and childbirth, making them willing to pay for more expensive services. Concern about an emergency for mothers or infants, especially of high-risk mothers was also an important factor to make mothers avoid local government-supported hospitals. Adjusted multi-level logistic regression indicated that DCIs of government-supported OUAs were higher than the ones of their counterpart areas. Conclusion Our results suggest that current OUAs do not reflect reality. Identification of true OUAs where physical distance is a real barrier to the use of obstetric service and focused investment on them is necessary. In addition, more sophisticated performance indicator other than DCI needs to be developed.},

Išanalizavus mokslinę literatūrą straipsnyje argumentuojama, kad kovodamas su stresu, patiriamu paimant vaiką iš šeimos, darbuotojas neretai naudoja kliento objektyvizavimo strategiją, kuri gali būti traktuojama kaip agresijos forma.

This applies to child rights and protection institutions which have a responsibility to take a child out of the family in the case of a threat to their safety. Problems related to workplace quality lead to a lack of qualified employees in this sector, and this problem is emphasized not only in Lithuania. Institutional aggression is typical of institutions to which the state attributes certain functions of abuse (e.g. public safety). Employee's intervention into the family can also be regarded as aggression performed by institutions, and the nature of work in these institutions may be associated with the problem of workplace aggression. However, in the research on workplace quality among the indicators of workplace aggression we do not find the indicator of employees' aggression against clients. We presume that an employee's function to take a child from a family (the use of coercion) can affect their well-being. So, in the context of workplace quality, the concept of workplace aggression has to be re-conceptualized by including institutional aggression enforced by an employee.},

abstract={B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 (BMI1) has been reported to be an oncoprotein. BMI1 represses tumor suppressors to promote cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer progression. Although it is known that the expression of BMI1 is increased in many cancer types, the mechanism of BMI1 upregulation is not yet clear. We performed integrative analysis for 3 sets of prostate cancer (PCa) genomic data, and found that BMI1 and androgen receptor (AR) were positively correlated, suggesting that AR might regulate BMI1. Next, we showed that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) upregulated both mRNA and protein levels of BMI1 and that BMI1 was increased in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) from both human patients and a mouse xenograph model. We further identified an AR binding site in the promoter/enhancer region of BMI1, and confirmed BMI1 as the direct target of AR using gene-editing technology. We also demonstrated that high expression of BMI1 is critical for the development of castration-resistance. Our data also suggest that BMI1-specific inhibitors could be an effective treatment of CRPC.},

abstract={Apart from constantly grappling with issues such as the inspiration of the Bible, theologians are also keen observers of cultural and societal changes and shifts and their impact on the interpretation of the Bible. Postmodernism serves as a briefcase in point. However, theologians do not seem to be equally responsive to natural disasters such as the present global COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst the presence of the coronavirus is reshaping the nature of our planet and threatening the well-being of all of its inhabitants, the future of formal theology is also under threat. As a matter of ‘academic survival’, a so-called ‘ancient-future’ approach is urgently called for, one that entails a mimetic rereading of the theologians of the Bible who were the first responders during the times of pandemics and other calamities. The apostle Paul served as our example in this regard. A ‘preferential option for the poor’, inherent in his theology, directly influenced his organisation of, and personal involvement in, two impactful collections for the poor in Judea during the extended periods of famine and poverty. Using ‘mimetically synchronising’ with his theological rhythms, corresponding embodied responses of theologians during the corona pandemic could become a reality. Only then will there be hope for a vibrant new post-corona theology, a lived one at that! Contribution: The focus of this article represents an exegetical, historical and practical reflection, within a paradigm in which the intersection of religious studies and social sciences generates an interdisciplinary contested discourse. The article comprises exegesis of the Ancient Near Eastern scriptures and the Early Church, including studies in the field of early Christian literature and the New Testament.},

abstract={Across the world, nature-triggered disasters fuelled by climate change are worsening. Some two billion people have been affected by the consequences of natural hazards over the last ten years, 95% of which were weather-related (such as floods and windstorms). Fires swept across large parts of California, and in Australia caused unprecedented destruction to lives, wildlife and bush. This picture is likely to become the new normal, and indeed may worsen if unchecked. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that in some locations, disaster that once had a once-in-a-century frequency may become annual events by 2050.Disaster management needs to keep up. Good cooperation and coordination of crisis response operations are of critical importance to react rapidly and adequately to any crisis situation, while post-disaster recovery presents opportunities to build resilience towards reducing the scale of the next disaster. Technology to support crisis response has advanced greatly in the last few years. Systems for early warning, command and control and decision-making have been successfully implemented in many countries and regions all over the world. Efforts to improve humanitarian response, in particular in relation to combating disasters in rapidly urbanising cities, have also led to better approaches that grapple with complexity and uncertainty.The challenges however are daunting. Many aspects related to the efficient collection and integration of geo-information, applied semantics and situational awareness for disaster management are still open, while agencies, organisations and governmental authorities need to improve their practices for building better resilience.Gi4DM 2020 marked the 13th edition of the Geoinformation for Disaster Management series of conferences. The first conference was held in 2005 in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which claimed the lives of over 220,000 civilians. The 2019-20 Australian Bushfire Season saw some 18.6 million Ha of bushland burn, 5,900 buildings destroyed and nearly three billion vertebrates killed. Gi4DM 2020 then was held during Covid-19 pandemic, which took the lives of more than 1,150,000 people by the time of the conference. The pandemic affected the organisation of the conference, but the situation also provided the opportunity to address important global problems.The fundamental goal of the Gi4DM has always been to provide a forum where emergency responders, disaster managers, urban planners, stakeholders, researchers, data providers and system developers can discuss challenges, share experience, discuss new ideas and demonstrate technology. The 12 previous editions of Gi4DM conferences were held in Delft, the Netherlands (March 2005), Goa, India (September 2006), Toronto, Canada (May 2007), Harbin, China (August 2008), Prague, Czech Republic (January 2009), Torino, Italy (February 2010), Antalya, Turkey (May 2011), Enschede, the Netherlands (December, 2012), Hanoi, Vietnam (December 2013), Montpellier, France (2015), Istanbul, Turkey (2018) and Prague, Czech Republic (2019). Through the years Gi4DM has been organised in cooperation with different international bodies such as ISPRS, UNOOSA, ICA, ISCRAM, FIG, IAG, OGC and WFP and supported by national organisations.Gi4DM 2020 was held as part of Climate Change and Disaster Management: Technology and Resilience for a Troubled World. The event took place through the whole week of 30th of November to 4th of December, Sydney, Australia and included three events: Gi4DM 2020, NSW Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute (NSW SSSI) annual meeting and Urban Resilience Asia Pacific 2 (URAP2).The event explored two interlinked aspects of disaster management in relation to climate change. The first was geo-information technologies and their application for work in crisis situations, as well as sensor and communication networks and their roles for improving situational awareness. The second aspect was resilience, and its role and purpose across the entire cycle of disaster management, from pre-disaster preparedness to post-disaster recovery including challenges and opportunities in relation to rapid urbanisation and the role of security in improved disaster management practices.This volume consists of 22 scientific papers. These were selected on the basis of double-blind review from among the 40 short papers submitted to the Gi4DM 2020 conference. Each paper was reviewed by two scientific reviewers. The authors of the papers were encouraged to revise, extend and adapt their papers to reflect the comments of the reviewers and fit the goals of this volume. The selected papers concentrate on monitoring and analysis of various aspects related to Covid-19 (4), emergency response (4), earthquakes (3), flood (2), forest fire, landslides, glaciers, drought, land cover change, crop management, surface temperature, address standardisation and education for disaster management. The presented methods range from remote sensing, LiDAR and photogrammetry on different platforms to GIS and Web-based technologies. Figure 1 illustrates the covered topics via wordcount of keywords and titles.The Gi4DM 2020 program consisted of scientific presentations, keynote speeches, panel discussions and tutorials. The four keynotes speakers Prof Suzan Cutter (Hazard and Vulnerability Research Institute, USC, US), Jeremy Fewtrell (NSW Fire and Rescue, Australia), Prof Orhan Altan (Ad-hoc Committee on RISK and Disaster Management, GeoUnions, Turkey) and Prof Philip Gibbins (Fenner School of Environment and Society, ANU, Australia) concentrated on different aspects of disaster and risk management in the context of climate change. Eight tutorials offered exciting workshops and hands-on on: Semantic web tools and technologies within Disaster Management, Structure-from-motion photogrammetry, Radar Remote Sensing, Dam safety: Monitoring subsidence with SAR Interferometry, Location-based Augmented Reality apps with Unity and Mapbox, Visualising bush fires datasets using open source, Making data smarter to manage disasters and emergency situational awareness and Response using HERE Location Services. The scientific sessions were blended with panel discussions to provide more opportunities to exchange ideas and experiences, connect people and researchers from all over the world.The editors of this volume acknowledge all members of the scientific committee for their time, careful review and valuable comments: Abdoulaye Diakité (Australia), Alexander Rudloff (Germany), Alias Abdul Rahman (Malaysia), Alper Yilmaz (USA), Amy Parker (Australia), Ashraf Dewan (Australia), Bapon Shm Fakhruddin (New Zealand), Batuhan Osmanoglu (USA), Ben Gorte (Australia), Bo Huang (Hong Kong), Brendon McAtee (Australia), Brian Lee (Australia), Bruce Forster (Australia), Charity Mundava (Australia), Charles Toth (USA), Chris Bellman (Australia), Chris Pettit (Australia), Clive Fraser (Australia), Craig Glennie (USA), David Belton (Australia), Dev Raj Paudyal (Australia), Dimitri Bulatov (Germany), Dipak Paudyal (Australia), Dorota Iwaszczuk (Germany), Edward Verbree (The Netherlands), Eliseo Clementini (Italy), Fabio Giulio Tonolo (Italy), Fazlay Faruque (USA), Filip Biljecki (Singapore), Petra Helmholz (Australia), Francesco Nex (The Netherlands), Franz Rottensteiner (Germany), George Sithole (South Africa), Graciela Metternicht (Australia), Haigang Sui (China), Hans-Gerd Maas (Germany), Hao Wu (China), Huayi Wu (China), Ivana Ivanova (Australia), Iyyanki Murali Krishna (India), Jack Barton (Australia), Jagannath Aryal (Australia), Jie Jiang (China), Joep Compvoets (Belgium), Jonathan Li (Canada), Kourosh Khoshelham (Australia), Krzysztof Bakuła (Poland), Lars Bodum (Denmark), Lena Halounova (Czech Republic), Madhu Chandra (Germany), Maria Antonia Brovelli (Italy), Martin Breunig (Germany), Martin Tomko (Australia), Mila Koeva (The Netherlands), Mingshu Wang (The Netherlands), Mitko Aleksandrov (Australia), Mulhim Al Doori (UAE), Nancy Glenn (Australia), Negin Nazarian (Australia), Norbert Pfeifer (Austria), Norman Kerle (The Netherlands), Orhan Altan (Turkey), Ori Gudes (Australia), Pawel Boguslawski (Poland), Peter van Oosterom (The Netherlands), Petr Kubíček (Czech Republic), Petros Patias (Greece), Piero Boccardo (Italy), Qiaoli Wu (China), Qing Zhu (China), Riza Yosia Sunindijo (Australia), Roland Billen (Belgium), Rudi Stouffs (Singapore), Scott Hawken (Australia), Serene Coetzee (South Africa), Shawn Laffan (Australia), Shisong Cao (China), Sisi Zlatanova (Australia), Songnian Li (Canada), Stephan Winter (Australia), Tarun Ghawana (Australia), Ümit Işıkdağ (Turkey), Wei Li (Australia), Wolfgang Reinhardt (Germany), Xianlian Liang (Finland) and Yanan Liu (China).The editors would like to express their gratitude to all contributors, who made this volume possible.

abstract={Across the world, nature-triggered disasters fuelled by climate change are worsening. Some two billion people have been affected by the consequences of natural hazards over the last ten years, 95% of which were weather-related (such as floods and windstorms). Fires swept across large parts of California, and in Australia caused unprecedented destruction to lives, wildlife and bush. This picture is likely to become the new normal, and indeed may worsen if unchecked. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that in some locations, disaster that once had a once-in-a-century frequency may become annual events by 2050.Disaster management needs to keep up. Good cooperation and coordination of crisis response operations are of critical importance to react rapidly and adequately to any crisis situation, while post-disaster recovery presents opportunities to build resilience towards reducing the scale of the next disaster. Technology to support crisis response has advanced greatly in the last few years. Systems for early warning, command and control and decision-making have been successfully implemented in many countries and regions all over the world. Efforts to improve humanitarian response, in particular in relation to combating disasters in rapidly urbanising cities, have also led to better approaches that grapple with complexity and uncertainty.The challenges however are daunting. Many aspects related to the efficient collection and integration of geo-information, applied semantics and situational awareness for disaster management are still open, while agencies, organisations and governmental authorities need to improve their practices for building better resilience.Gi4DM 2020 marked the 13th edition of the Geoinformation for Disaster Management series of conferences. The first conference was held in 2005 in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which claimed the lives of over 220,000 civilians. The 2019-20 Australian Bushfire Season saw some 18.6 million Ha of bushland burn, 5,900 buildings destroyed and nearly three billion vertebrates killed.

abstract={Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumour in adulthood. Despite strong research efforts current treatment options have a limited impact on glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) which contribute to GBM formation, progression and chemoresistance. Invasive growth of GSCs is in part associated with epithelial–mesenchymal-like transition (EMT), a mechanism associated with CD73 in several cancers. Here, we show that CD73 regulates the EMT activator SNAIL1 and further investigate the role of enzymatic and non-enzymatic CD73 activity in GBM progression. Reduction of CD73 protein resulted in significant suppression of GSC viability, proliferation and clonogenicity, whereas CD73 enzymatic activity exhibited negative effects only on GSC invasion involving impaired downstream adenosine (ADO) signalling. Furthermore, application of phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline, a potent immunomodulator, effectively inhibited ZEB1 and CD73 expression and significantly decreased viability, clonogenicity, and invasion of GSC in vitro cultures. Given the involvement of adenosine and A3 adenosine receptor in GSC invasion, we investigated the effect of the pharmacological inhibition of A3AR on GSC maintenance. Direct A3AR inhibition promoted apoptotic cell death and impaired the clonogenicity of GSC cultures. Taken together, our data indicate that CD73 is an exciting novel target in GBM therapy. Moreover, pharmacological interference, resulting in disturbed ADO signalling, provides new opportunities to innovate GBM therapy.},

abstract={Background Medical data from family doctors are of great importance to health care researchers but seem to be locked in German practices and, thus, are underused in research. The RADAR project (Routine Anonymized Data for Advanced Health Services Research) aims at designing, implementing and piloting a generic research architecture, technical software solutions as well as procedures and workflows to unlock data from family doctor’s practices. A long-term medical data repository for research taking legal requirements into account is established. Thereby, RADAR helps closing the gap between the European countries and to contribute data from primary care in Germany. Methods The RADAR project comprises three phases: (1) analysis phase, (2) design phase, and (3) pilot. First, interdisciplinary workshops were held to list prerequisites and requirements. Second, an architecture diagram with building blocks and functions, and an ordered list of process steps (workflow) for data capture and storage were designed. Third, technical components and workflows were piloted. The pilot was extended by a data integration workflow using patient-reported outcomes (paper-based questionnaires). Results The analysis phase resulted in listing 17 essential prerequisites and guiding requirements for data management compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Based on this list existing approaches to fulfil the RADAR tasks were evaluated—for example, re-using BDT interface for data exchange and Trusted Third Party-approach for consent management and record linkage. Consented data sets of 100 patients were successfully exported, separated into person-identifying and medical data, pseudonymised and saved. Record linkage and data integration workflows for patient-reported outcomes in the RADAR research database were successfully piloted for 63 responders. Conclusion The RADAR project successfully developed a generic architecture together with a technical framework of tools, interfaces, and workflows for a complete infrastructure for practicable and secure processing of patient data from family doctors. All technical components and workflows can be reused for further research projects. Additionally, a Trusted Third Party-approach can be used as core element to implement data privacy protection in such heterogeneous family doctor’s settings. Optimisations identified comprise a fully-electronic consent recording using tablet computers, which is part of the project’s extension phase.},

abstract={Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second cause of cancer related death in North American men. Androgens play an important role in its progression by regulating the expression of several genes including fusion ones that results from structural chromosome rearrangements. TMPRSS2-ERG is a fusion gene commonly observed in over 50% of PCa tumors, and its expression can be transcriptionally regulated by the androgen receptor (AR) given its androgen responsive elements. TMPRSS2-ERG could be involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) during tumor development. ERG has been reported as a key transcriptional factor in the AR-ERG-WNT network where five SFRP proteins, structurally similar to WNT ligands and considered to be WNT pathway antagonists, can regulate signaling in the extracellular space by binding to WNT proteins or Frizzled receptors. It has been shown that over-expression of SFRP1 protein can regulate the transcriptional activity of AR and inhibits the formation of colonies in LNCaP cells. However, the effect of SFRP1 has been controversial since differential effects have been observed depending on its concentration and tissue location. In this study, we explored the role of exogenous SFRP1 protein in cells expressing the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. Methods To evaluate the effect of exogenous SFRP1 protein on PCa cells expressing TMPRSS2-ERG, we performed in silico analysis from TCGA cohort, expression assays by RT-qPCR and Western blot, cell viability and cell cycle measurements by cytometry, migration and invasion assays by xCELLigance system and murine xenografts. Results We demonstrated that SFRP1 protein increased ERG expression by promoting cellular migration in vitro and increasing tumor growth in vivo in PCa cells with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. Conclusions These results suggest the possible role of exogenous SFRP1 protein as a modulator of AR-ERG-WNT signaling network in cells positive to TMPRSS2-ERG. Further, investigation is needed to determine if SFRP1 protein could be a target in against this type of PCa.},

abstract={Prostate cancer (PCa) is initially driven by excessive androgen receptor (AR) signaling with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) being a major therapeutic approach to its treatment. However, the development of drug resistance is a significant limitation on the effectiveness of both first-line and more recently developed second-line ADTs. There is a need then to study AR signaling within the context of other oncogenic signaling pathways that likely mediate this resistance. This review focuses on interactions between AR signaling, the well-known phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT pathway, and an emerging mediator of these pathways, the Hippo/YAP1 axis in metastatic castrate-resistant PCa, and their involvement in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a feature of disease progression and ADT resistance. Analysis of these pathways in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may provide an opportunity to evaluate their utility as biomarkers and address their importance in the development of resistance to current ADT with potential to guide future therapies.},

abstract={Exposure of the vertebrate embryo to maternal hormones can have long-lasting effects on its phenotype, which has been studied extensively by experimentally manipulating maternal steroids, mostly androgens, in bird eggs. Yet, there is a severe lack of understanding of how and when these effects are actually mediated, hampering both underlying proximate and ultimate explanations. Here we report a novel finding that the embryo expresses androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ERα) mRNA in its extraembryonic membranes (EMs) as early as before its own hormone production starts, suggesting a novel substrate for action of maternal hormones on the offspring. We also report the first experimental evidence for steroid receptor regulation in the avian embryo in response to yolk steroid levels: the level of AR is dependent on yolk androgen levels only in the EMs but not in body tissues, suggesting embryonic adaptation to maternal hormones. The results also solve the problem of uptake of lipophilic steroids from the yolk, why they affect multiple traits, and how they could mediate maternal effects without affecting embryonic sexual differentiation.},

abstract={Resistance to hormone therapy and disease progression is the major challenge in clinical management of prostate cancer (PC). Drugs currently used in PC therapy initially show a potent antitumor effects, but PC gradually develops resistance, relapses and spreads. Most patients who fail primary therapy and have recurrences eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is almost incurable. The nerve growth factor (NGF) acts on a variety of non-neuronal cells by activating the NGF tyrosine-kinase receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). NGF signaling is deregulated in PC. In androgen-dependent PC cells, TrkA mediates the proliferative action of NGF through its crosstalk with the androgen receptor (AR). Epithelial PC cells, however, acquire the ability to express NGF and TrkA, as the disease progresses, indicating a role for NGF/TrkA axis in PC progression and androgen-resistance. We here report that once activated by NGF, TrkA mediates proliferation, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various CRPC cells. NGF promotes organoid growth in 3D models of CRPC cells, and specific inhibition of TrkA impairs all these responses. Thus TrkA represents a new biomarker to target in CRPC.},

abstract={Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common killer among men in Western countries. Targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the current therapeutic regime for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic PCa. However, most patients relapse and become resistant to ADT, leading to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and eventually death. Several proposed mechanisms have been proposed for CRPC; however, the exact mechanism through which CRPC develops is still unclear. One possible pathway is that the AR remains active in CRPC cases. Therefore, understanding AR signaling networks as primary PCa changes into metastatic CRPC is key to developing future biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for PCa and CRPC. In the current review, we focused on three novel biomarkers (ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6) that were demonstrated to play critical roles in CRPC progression, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) drug resistance, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for patients treated with ADT or AR inhibition. In addition, we summarize how these potential biomarkers can be used in the clinic for diagnosis and as therapeutic targets of PCa.},

abstract={Smart textiles based on actuator materials are of practical interest, but few types have been commercially exploited. The challenge for researchers has been to bring the concept out of the laboratory by working out how to build these smart materials on an industrial scale and permanently incorporate them into textiles. Smart textiles are considered as the next frontline for electronics. Recent developments in advance technologies have led to the appearance of wearable electronics by fabricating, miniaturizing and embedding flexible conductive materials into textiles. The combination of textiles and smart materials have contributed to the development of new capabilities in fabrics with the potential to change how athletes, patients, soldiers, first responders, and everyday consumers interact with their clothes and other textile products. Actuating textiles in particular, have the potential to provide a breakthrough to the area of smart textiles in many ways. The incorporation of actuating materials in to textiles is a striking approach as a small change in material anisotropy properties can be converted into significant performance enhancements, due to the densely interconnected structures. Herein, the most recent advances in smart materials based on actuating textiles are reviewed. The use of novel emerging twisted synthetic yarns, conducting polymers, hybrid carbon nanotube and spandex yarn actuators, as well as most of the cutting–edge polymeric actuators which are deployed as smart textiles are discussed.},

abstract={Prostate cancer (PC) remains a widespread malignancy in men. Since the androgen/androgen receptor (AR) axis is associated with the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, suppression of AR-dependent signaling by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) still represents the primary intervention for this disease. Despite the initial response, prostate cancer frequently develops resistance to ADT and progresses. As such, the disease becomes metastatic and few therapeutic options are available at this stage. Although the majority of studies are focused on the role of AR signaling, compelling evidence has shown that estrogens and their receptors control prostate cancer initiation and progression through a still debated mechanism. Epithelial versus mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in metastatic spread as well as drug-resistance of human cancers, and many studies on the role of this process in prostate cancer progression have been reported. We discuss here the findings on the role of estrogen/estrogen receptor (ER) axis in epithelial versus mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells. The pending questions concerning this issue are presented, together with the impact of the available data in clinical management of prostate cancer patients.},

abstract={These studies compared the efficacies of our clinical agent galeterone (Gal) and the FDA-approved prostate cancer drug, enzalutamide (ENZ) with two lead next generation galeterone analogs (NGGAs), VNPP414 and VNPP433-3β, using prostate cancer (PC) in vitro and in vivo models. Antitumor activities of orally administered agents were also assessed in CWR22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice. We demonstrated that Gal and NGGAs degraded AR/AR-V7 and Mnk1/2; blocked cell cycle progression and proliferation of human PC cells; induced apoptosis; inhibited cell migration, invasion, and putative stem cell markers; and reversed the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, Gal/NGGAs (alone or in combination) also inhibited the growth of ENZ-, docetaxel-, and mitoxantrone-resistant human PC cell lines. The NGGAs exhibited improved pharmacokinetic profiles over Gal in mice. Importantly, in vivo testing showed that VNPP433-3β (at 7.53-fold lower equimolar dose than Gal) markedly suppressed (84% vs. Gal, 47%; p < 0.01) the growth of castration-resistant PC (CRPC) CWR22Rv1 xenograft tumors, with no apparent host toxicity. ENZ was ineffective in this CRPC xenograft model. In summary, our findings show that targeting AR/AR-V7 and Mnk1/2 for degradation represents an effective therapeutic strategy for PC/CRPC treatment and supports further development of VNPP433-3β towards clinical investigation.},

The principle of speed of procedure obliges law enforcement officials and courts to take all procedural steps and to take decisions as quickly as possible. The requirement of expeditiousness of proceedings, the prohibition of unjustified delay, the requirement to take procedural steps within the shortest possible period of time and the principle of delay in criminal proceedings are significant in that they must be complied with at all stages of the proceedings. This means that pre-trial officers, the prosecutor and the court must take all the measures and means required by law to investigate and deal with the crime as briefly as possible, keep the process intense and protect every person subject to criminal proceedings from prolonged ignorance. This article will also answer the question of whether the assessment of the actions of pre-trial officers in pre-trial civil liability matters is identical to the treatment of the same actions from the point of view of the criminal proceedings only.},

Komercinės paslaptys yra vienas labiausiai paplitusių komercinę vertę turinčios inter alia intelektinės nuosavybės objektų teisinės apsaugos būdų. Komercinių paslapčių apsaugos pradžios momentas nėra susijęs su valstybės institucijų įsikišimu. Priešingai nei patentų, komercinių paslapčių teisinis režimas yra labiau suvokiamas verslui – siekiant apsaugoti komercines paslaptis de facto joms nekeliami jokie didesni reikalavimai nei tokios informacijos vertė.1 Šios aplinkybės ir lėmė komercinių paslapčių didelį paplitimą. Komercinės paslaptys yra reguliuojamos skirtingų teisės šakų normų: civilinės (inter alia darbo), administracinės ir baudžiamosios teisės normomis. Toks platus reguliavimas gali būti tinkamai taikomas tik aiškiai atribojant skirtingų atsakomybės rūšių taikymo atvejus. Deja, Lietuvos Respublikos baudžiamojo kodekso 210 ir 211 straipsniai yra abstraktūs, kartojantys kituose teisės aktuose vartojamus terminus, nenustačius kokybiškai reikšmingų atribojimo kriterijų. Netinkama juridinė technika komercinių paslapčių apsaugos srityje lėmė situaciją, kad baudžiamosios atsakomybės taikymas labiau priklauso nuo teisės taikytojų norų vienur ar kitur matyti nusikalstamą veiką ar jos nematyti. Taip pat toks reguliavimas tampa verslo subjektų alternatyviu teisinių ginčų sprendimo būdu baudžiamosios teisės priemonėmis ir jis yra perteklinis.Alternate abstract:The article was prepared on the basis of a paper presented at the scientific conference The Challenges of Changing Society in Criminal Justice, organised by the Mykolas Romeris Law School, Institute of Criminal Law and Process. Commercial secrets are one of the most common ways of protecting, inter alia, both intellectual property objects and commercially valuable information. The moment of commencement of the protection of trade secrets does not relate to the intervention of the authorities or registration. In contrast to patents, the legal regime for trade secrets is more business-aware, de facto requiring no greater requirement than the value of such information to protect trade secrets. Inter alia, these circumstances have led to the widespread use of trade secrets. Trade secrets are governed by the rules of various branches of law: civil (inter alia, labor), administrative and criminal law. Such wide regulation can only be properly applied with a clear distinction between the different types of liability. Unfortunately, Articles 210 and 211 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania are abstract and repeating terms used in other legal acts without qualitatively significant criteria for delimitation. The inadequate legal technique in the area of trade secret protection has resulted in the situation what the application of criminal liability is more dependent on the will of law enforcement officers to qualification like crime or not.

abstract={The Digital Dentistry Society Poster Session- 3rd October 2019, Kurhaus Baden Baden, 9am- 3pm Science P01 Quantitative accuracy of cone-beam computerised tomography (CBCT) derived biomodels Sohaib Shujaat, Eman Shaheen, Constantinus Politis, Reinhilde Jacobs OMFS IMPATH Research Group, Department of Imaging and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leuven and Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Correspondence: Sohaib Shujaat (sohaib.shujaat@kuleuven.be) Abstract Background: Biomodeling in integration with digital imaging techniques such as intra-oral scanning and cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) is being commonly practiced in dental implantology for pre-operative treatment planning, clinical teaching and evaluating bone density and drilling techniques. The objective of following study was to assess the quantitative accuracy of CBCT-derived mandibular biomodels. Methods: A CBCT dataset was segmented and mandible was isolated. Fifteen mandibular biomodels were fabricated utilizing multijet (MJ=4), digital light processing (DLP=4), stereolithography (SLA=2), fused deposition modeling (FDM=2), colorjet (CJ=2) and selective laser sintering (LS=1) based high-end commercial and in-house printers. Printed models were superimposed onto the original mandible for comparing surface accuracy. A part comparison analysis with color-coded map was carried out for evaluating the difference between each printed and original model surface. Results: MJ technology showed least amount of error associated with both erupted and impacted teeth. Highest bony surface accuracy was achieved with SLA and LS based biomodels. Trabecular structures were most accurately printed with MJ printers. FDM technology had the highest overall absolute mean error associated with both teeth and bone. No significant differences were observed between each surface of original and printed models. Conclusions: Overall biomodels were able to well replicate skeletal and dental anatomical surfaces. However, some models showed shortcomings in relation to depicting trabecular architecture which might influence bone density for drilling bone and placing dental implants.

Piatti 10, 21100 Varese, Italy. Correspondence: Marco Farronato (marcofarronato@msn.com) Abstract Background. On the base of the state of the art on the applications of augmented reality (AR) in dentistry from previous studies a new system was developed and in vivo tested with Institutional Review Board approval of the Ethics Committee of Policlinico of Milan (n. 421). The purpose of the new system is to provide a new light, portable hand-held smart device which provides a compound superimposed dynamic vision of the anatomical structures of the patient, radiologic exams and digitally positioned medical devices for AR-guided operations. Methods. CBCT data and the .stl files of miniscrews (TADs), (Leone, Firenze, Italy), were imported in a dicom viewer, placed in the correct position and fixed, then exported to .stl format separately. The digital images were uploaded to a server and opened with a smart, light hand-held hardware. The hardware was placed in front of the patient placed in N.H.P and the new software was started. Superimposition was regulated with pinch gesture on the touch screen until correct positioning of the frontal teeth of the patient, the opacity of digital images were regulated with a function of the software. The superimposition was automatically stabilized by a function of the software using software development kit (SDK) engines. Tads were placed under the guide of the compound vision. Time measurements were taken on superimposition by different operators and the error was calculated with a digital caliper. Results. The new system provided effectively a dynamic functional compound superimposition of anatomical structures and previously digitally placed medical devices. The error in the positioning of the TADs was calculated as < of 0.3 mm for both while time measurements of the superimposition session were less than 5 minutes for each session. Conclusions. The new proposed system effectively provides a simple and light dynamic AR superimposition of digital data on a surgical site providing the clinician a compound vision of anatomical structures. The TADs were placed with AR assisted surgery with a acceptable error, further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed. P03 Flat to Flat Vs Magic Five Cone Morse Connection regarding height/width ratio of peri-implant buccal soft tissues Cristian Scognamiglio1, Stefano Ponti2, Veronica Campana3, Davide Farronato4 Correspondence: Cristian Scognamiglio (c.scognamiglio93@gmail.com) 1DDs, Private Practitioner, Milan, Italy; 2DDs, Private Practitioner, Varese, Italy; 3Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 4PhD, PD, AP, Assistant Professor, University of Insubria, Varse, Italy Abstract Purpose. Modern implantology has been focused on the peri-implant mucosa maturation patterns, with particular attention on the frontal area, aiming to obtain an optimal aesthetic result. The purpose of the following study is to analyze height/width proportion in the peri-implant buccal tissues between two different types of connection: Flat to Flat and Magic Five Cone Morse Connection (Anyridge®). Methods. The present study analyzes 294 implants, the measurements were done with digital 3D technology at one year from the provisional crown placement. Every single implant was matched with its own Scan Body and was scanned with 3Shape D700, in order to obtain a tridimensional section of the model. Peri-implant measurements included the width of the peri-implant mucosa (HV), calculated from the implant connection to the buccal mucosa surface on a line perpendicular to the main implant axis. For the height of the peri-implant tissues (VV), we considered as well, the same geometrical line as the apical point of the measure to calculate the perpendicular distance to the most coronally gingiva point. All the recorded data were analyzed with Test Pearson 2-Tailed (95% Confidence Interval) by IBM® SPSS® Statistics Software. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee. Results. The average ratio between height/width of the two different types of connection were compared. Flat to Flat Connection shows an average VV:HV ratio equal to 1:1,54. Meanwhile, Magic Five Cone Morse Connection has an average ratio of 1:1,18. This results are statistically significative at p ≤ 0,001 (Pearson 2-Tailed). Conclusions. This study based on 294 implants approved Nozawa’s past observations on 14 cases: the average ratio of VV:HV in Flat to Flat connection is 1:1,54. Analyzing the new Magic Five Cone Morse Connection results, the average ratio VV:HV is 1:1,18, showing higher efficiency on biological integration tending to the natural tooth parameters investigated by Wennström: VV:HV = 1,5:1. The differences discovered between the two types of connections can be linked to the “Pumping Effect” described by Zipprich and these data refers to one year maturation period. Therefore, when a transverse load is applied on a Flat to Flat Connection, there is a tendency to create a micro gap between the implant and the prosthetic abutment interface. The presence of the gap induces micro movements that may work as a pump allowing bacterial endotoxins contamination, compromising the peri-implant soft tissue trophism. P04 How to optimize tissue for the Coronally Advanced Flap. Interaction between emergence profile and tissue tropism Luciano Laveglia1, Veronica Campana2, Marco Colombo3, Davide Farronato4 1DentistryStudent, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 2DentistryStudent, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 3DDs, Private Practitioner, Milan, Italy; 4PhD, PD, AP, Assistant Professor, University of Insubria, Varse, Italy Correspondence: Luciano Laveglia (l.laveglia@outlook.it) Abstract Background. Several operative protocols recommend the realisation of cervical restorations to restore CEJ in patients undergoing mucogingival plastic surgery.The purpose was to evaluate the response of gingival tissues following the emergency profile restoration with , in patients subsequently subjected to Mucogingival surgery. Methods. Data were collected from 50 teeth, 47 of which were affected by vestibular recession and 3 without recession.The STL files for the 2 stone models made after the alginate imprint detected prior the conservative therapy (TO) and after at least 60 days (T1) were analyzed.The three dimensional matching of the 2 models was carried out by the GeomagicSoftware and subsequently, with Meshmixer, a series of ortho-shaped and parallel (cutter) planes were superimposed (0 + 0.5 mm, 0 + 1mm, 0 + 1.5 mm) in the Coronal and apical direction considering how to plan 0 the T0 buccal zenith of the analyzed element. The desired measurements were obtained using 3D Viewer visualization software, going to measure the distance between the cutter intersections with the models T0 and T1. The study was conducted in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee at Insubria University. Results. After the modification of the emergency profile, the thickness and height of the gingival tissue at the level of the free gingival margin has increased statistically significantly with a ratio of the 2 variables is equal to 1.183. Moreover, the increase in tooth thickness corresponds to an increase in the thickness of the gingival margin at the zenith according to a ratio of 1.8:1.Moreover, in subjects with Biotype 2 (festonate), a greater reduction in the recession was detected compared to those with biotype 1 (thin). Conclusions. The realization of 5-class restorations with an increased emergence profile performed 2 months prior to the periodontal surgery shows clinical advantages. P05 Implementation of Automated Digital Odontometry in Studies of Tooth Crown Morphology Armen Gaboutchian1, Kristina Goryainova2, Samvel Apresyan2, Vladimir Knyaz3,4 1Moscow State Medical-Stomatological University, Moscow, Russia; 2Peoples Friendship University of Russia, Moscow, Russia; 3State Research Institute of Aviation System, Moscow, Russia; 4Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia Correspondence: Kristina Goryainova (kristina@dda-russia.ru) Abstract Background. To propose a method for objective, robust and precise assessment of tooth crown (natural of artificially designed) morphology, where tooth crown can be taken as a whole or in its integral parts, being analysed through variability of measured or calculated parameters. Related matters dealing with basic interpretation of dental morphology, formalisation of measurements and orientating of measured teeth are presented as well. Methods. Experimental part of the study has been carried out on a sequence of 3D images obtained from dental arch casts, experimentally prepared teeth on the same stone cast models and modelled (digitally and manually) artificial crowns. Digitally modelled crowns were assessed in their default morphology and after reshaping by technician. A significant source of studied samples relates to palaeoanthropological findings, which refer to various historical periods: Upper Palaeolithic, Early and Middle Bronze, Middle Ages and Modern Era. The studied images were obtained on dental and technical professional equipment (intraoral and laboratory scanners), custom designed photogrammetric scanners as well as on CBCT and micro-CT scanners. The scanning equipment, being chosen in accordance with the studied objects’ characteristics, provided high resolution digital images. Merged images of objects, obtained on various stages of the study or obtained on various equipment, were used as well. Measurements based on the proposed methods were carried out by means of software which provided, after 3D image loading, automated procedures of orientating, multidirectional sectioning modes, measurement landmark (point) detection, distance measurements, contour measurements, calculations, parameter presentation and analytical tools. Up to two hundred parameters are suggested in the current software version on each studied tooth section; the number of studied sections in the existing software version is limited by one hundred. The odontometric data includes linear, angular, contour parameters and coefficients referring to the whole crown or its parts. Results. Automatically generated odontometric data, obtained on series of images: intact tooth – manually modelled crown – suggested “on default” digital crown shape – reshaped digitally modelled crown, was compared in reference to maximal vestibular-oral dimension. Assessments included estimation of value and localisation of measured areas on tooth crown. Conclusions. Automated digital odontometry has demonstrated a potential for conducting measurements of tooth crowns. According to the obtained data, digital method of crown modelling can be considered more accurate and preferable in various terms of their usability.The work was performed with the support by Grant 17-29-04509 of Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR). P06 Analysis of the Height/Width ratio of peri-implant soft tissues in the different oral sectors Stefano Ponti1, Cristian Scognamiglio2, Veronica Campana3, Davide Farronato4 1DDs, Private Practitioner, Varese, Italy; 2DDs, Private Practitioner, Milan, Italy; 3Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 4PhD, PD, AP, Assistant Professor, University of Insubria, Varse, Italy Correspondence: Stefano Ponti (steponti@hotmail.it) Abstract Purpose. During the past years, frontal areas rehabilitation has been one of the most important topic of discussion in Implantology. The aim of a good anterior restoration, implant supported, is to achieve function and aesthetic result. The purpose of the following study is to analyze using 3D technology the height/width proportion in the peri-implant buccal tissues comparing different areas in the oral cavity. Methods. The present study analyzes 294 implants, the measurements were done with digital 3D technology at one year from the provisional crown placement. Every single implant was matched with its own Scan Body and was scanned with 3Shape D700, in order to obtain a tridimensional section of the model. Peri-implant measurements included the width of the peri-implant mucosa (HV), calculated from the implant connection to the buccal mucosa surface on a line perpendicular to the main implant axis. For the height of the peri-implant tissues (VV), we considered as well, the same geometrical line as the apical point of the measure to calculate the perpendicular distance to the most coronally gengiva point. The Implants were split into four main groups on the base of their position in the oral cavity: 1. 1. Anterior Maxilla 2. 2. Anterior Mandible 3. 3. Posterior Maxilla 4. 4. Posterior Mandible All the recorded data were analyzed with Test Pearson 2-Tailed (95% Confidence Interval) by IBM® SPSS® Statistics Software. Results. The average height/width ratio in the different areas of the oral cavity shows a significative difference between the anterior sectors and the posterior one. 1. 1. Anterior Maxilla 1:1.23 2. 2. Anterior Mandible 1:1.24 3. 3. Posterior Maxilla, 1:1.45 4. 4. Posterior Mandible, 1:1.77 These results are statistically significative at p ≤ 0,001 (Pearson 2-Tailed). Conclusions. This study based on 294 implants approves Nozawa’s past observations on 14 cases: the average ratio of VV:HV is overall 1:1.54. Analyzing the differences between the four areas, we can assert that in the aesthetic sectors there is a ratio that follows the height of peri-implant soft tissue; on the other hand in the posterior sectors the ratio is unfavorable to the tissue height. These results might be linked to two different factors: a greater thickness of posterior soft tissues and the role of Buccinator Muscle which during the impression phases is able to pull the vestibular fornix reducing its height. In addition we should not forget that the aesthetic areas requires a specific attention regarding transparency of the abutment caused by thin width of the soft tissues. P07 Key role in impression accuracy: transfer types or implant placement angulation? An in vitro 3D evaluation Veronica Campana1, Cristian Scognamiglio2, Giada Goffredo3, Davide Farronato4 1Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 2DDs, Private Practitioner, Milan, Italy; 3DDs, Private Practitioner, Milan, Italy; 4PhD, PD, AP, Assistant Professor, University of Insubria, Varse, Italy Correspondence: Veronica Campana (v.campana@studenti.uninsubria.it) Abstract Background. Accurate impression making is a fundamental prerequisite such to achieve a passive fit between the implant and the prosthetic structures. The aim of this study is to evaluate if there are differences in the accuracy of the impression using three different types of transfer and to analyze their efficiency in comparative situations given by different angles of implant placement. Methods. An acrylic resin master model with four implant analogues placed at 0, 15 and 35 degrees towards the horizontal plan was used. Twenty-seven polyvinyl siloxane impressions of the model were made using acrylic resin individual impression trays with the aim of evaluating three different types of transfer: a closed tray technique transfer, a classic open tray technique transfer and a telescopic open tray transfer. The impressions were poured with type IV die stone. After matching each analogue with a digital scan body, an STL file was achieved with the scanner “3SHAPE D2000”. An implant bar was projected from all the different STL files with “3 Shape Dental System” software. Each project is originated from each different impression in order to gain the implant position referred by the transfer under analysis. A comparison between this bars and the one projected on the master model was obtained with “Magic Materialise 13.0” software. Both a linear and angular measurement (heads in x, y and z axes) for every type of transfer, valuated in different angulation, was achieved. The collected data have been processed by the statistical software “IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, New York, United States” and analyzed with student’s T test and Kruskal-Wallis not parametric test. Results. Even if the student’s T test revealed a statistical significance of the different linear and angular measurements in ∆x, ∆y, ∆z changing the transfer’s type, more restrictive tests have highlighted a not statistical significance related to the transfer’s type. However, when considering a variation of the implant positioning angle, the same tests revealed a statistically significant difference. Conclusions. Considering the limitations of this study, it could be concluded that the type of transfer used is not a significant parameter rather than the implant positioning showed a significant key role in the precision success of impressions. P08 Drilling protocols in guided surgery: an in vitro study Nicolò Vercellini1, Veronica Campana2 1Nicolò Vercellini DDS; Research Fellow, ITEB “Innovative Technology and Engineered Biomaterial” Research Centre, director Prof. Alberto Caprioglio. Department of Medicine and Surgery; University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 2Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy Correspondence: Veronica Campana (veronica.campana93@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Demonstrate the better accuracy of a computer-guided surgery that follows a complete drilling protocol which includes all the steps in order to reach the whole depth of implant placement. The most apical point is where may occurs the largest angle of deviation from the projected one and where the drill may not be initially guided by the sleeve. As a conclusion, this in-vitro-study is meant to demonstrate the better precision of a real double-guided surgery both from the progressive osteotomies and from the guide of the entry point. Methods. A 3D model was created, projecting the positioning of a Ø3.8 x 13mm Camlog Conelog implant and a teeth supported template for guided surgery, with incisal-level windows in order to verify its right positioning on the dental elements. Dental SG resin (Formlabs) is the printing material used. Two kind of preparations are compared: * A complete sequence from this moment indicated as CIP (complete implant preparation) * A reduced sequence, indicated as RIP (reduced implant preparation), which doesn’t include all the gradual steps of drilling preparation in length. The osteotomies of the two sequences, CIP and RIP, are performed. The implants are positioned in the two models and subsequently, after the connection to a scan body, the model are acquired with an industrial certified scanner “3SHAPE D2000” (documented 5 micron accuracy ISO 12836; 4 × 5.0 MP cameras). Two STL files are obtained. The STL files are upload in Magics Materialize software and both implant positions (obtained with CIP and RIP) are compared with the initial implant positioning project. In this way it was possible to verify the real implant position obtained with the complete CIP sequence and with the reduced sequence RIP. Results. The superiority of the complete protocol (CIP) on the reduced one (RIP) is demonstrated. Compared to the implant placement of the initial project the RIP protocol gave a distance of 0.7823 mm and an angle of 1.42 deg; Instead, with the CIP protocol the implant was placed at a distance of 0.5235 mm and at an angle of 0.56 deg, always referred to the initial project. Conclusions. Within the limitations of this in-vitro study it can be concluded that, in order to achieve a greater accuracy in guided surgery, it is recommend a progressive drilling protocol that guarantees a guidance provided not only by the sleeve, but also by the progressive osteotomies. P09 Implants placed at 35 degrees: is a telescopic transfer more reliable? An in vitro 3D evaluation Veronica Campana1, Luciano Laveglia2, Marco Colombo3, Davide Farronato4 1Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 2Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 3DDs, Private Practitioner, Milan, Italy; (4) PhD, PD, AP, Assistant Professor, University of Insubria, Varse, Italy Correspondence: Veronica Campana (v.campana@studenti.uninsubria.it) Abstract Background. The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of three different transfers and to analyze their impression’s accuracy in an high implant angulation at 35°. In addition to the classic transfers for the open tray and closed-tray impression techniques, it’s tested also a telescopic open tray transfer. This last one is characterized by an inner hexagon that can sweep inside the outer body such to eliminate any extension of the connection under the conical interface. Moreover this study is meant to verify the incidence of the relative angulations between the transfer as well as if a 35° angulation prepone a favorite choice depending on this angle. The null hypothesis to validate was that there would be no differences in 3D accuracy between 3 different transfers when tested at 35°. Methods. A resin master model with 4 implant analogues placed at 0 and 35 degrees towards the horizontal plan was used. 27 polyvinyl siloxane impressions were made using acrylic resin individual impression trays with the aim of evaluating 3 different types of transfers. The impressions were poured with type IV stone. After matching each analogue with a digital scan body a STL file of the impressions was achieved with “3SHAPE D2000” scanner. An implant bar was projected from all the STL files with “3 Shape Dental System” software. These bars indicate the implant positions referred by the transfer under analysis. A comparison between this bars and the one projected on the master model was obtained with “Magic Materialise 13.0” software. Both a linear and angular measurement for every type of transfer, valuated in different angulation, was achieved. Results. All the measurements collected have been processed by the statistical software “IBM SPSS Statistics”. The not parametric Jonckheere-Terpstra test was performed and astatistically significant difference between the transfer types at 35° inclination was found (p=0.023) when considering the angular displacement between them. Conclusions. Within the limitations of this study it can be concluded that, even if the presence in the telescopic transfer of an inner hexagon that can sweep inside the outer body represents one more element of tolerance between the transfer body and the internal retractile hexagon, when tested at 35° it shows a greater precision and so the advantage to use a telescopic transfer in presence of tilted implants at high angulations seems the ideal solution. P10 ROBOTA: From Digitalization to Automation & Data Analytics Giorgio Castagno1, Veronica Campana2, Riccardo Castagno3 1Doctor of Dental Surgery, Private Practitioner, Borgosesia, Italy; 2Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 3Management Engineering Student, LIUC University, Castellanza, Italy Correspondence: Giorgio Castagno (giorgiocastagno@yahoo.it) Abstract Background. Expose the project of an automated sterilization chain and the related advantages, such as the reduction of high cycle-times, of the elevate risk of contaminations and of the huge production of waste. These are enemies that make the daily process stressful. We are reorienting the sterilization chain into a manufacturing system in order to obtain jobs’ continuous flow. Through value stream mapping, a method for analyzing the current state of events that take place from the beginning of the process to its end, we in fact observed that a change in the sterilization process is needed. Methods. The low value processes in dentistry operations are analyzed with “Lean and Six Sigma Dentistry”. An analysis of “Industry 4.0 system” that handle the sterilization is performed from the infected utensils’ carriage, with an Automated Guided Vehicle, to the disinfection, continuing to the wrapping process and storage using robots (Kr3 Agilus KUKA, Grugliasco, Italy). An integrated vision system scan which tools the system is processing: data are acquired during the entire process. ROBOTA can represent a powerful tool to optimize sterilization routine processes and to increase utensils fulfillment. Results. ROBOTA can reduce the time spent to sterilize surgical instruments. It can works 24/24h so operators can dispose of a bigger amount of envelopes’ stock such to satisfy every demand. In this way it’s not necessary to buy same utensils multiples time. It’s also able to track the tools consumption so that the utensils’ lifespan can be exploited as maximum as possible. In addition, optimizing the whole process chain, less energy is required from the autoclave, whereas less heat is dissipated from the waiting time between one cycle to the next. The digital processes are automated, so manpower’s presence and human error is not only reduced, but also eliminated, and not only for patients, but also for operators. ROBOTA can change the medical world, eliminating risky jobs and creating a higher level of service. This is an impactful tool that ensure to patients that the risk of contamination is close to 0 and the service can be faster. We’re now able to connect ROBOTA with our agenda through Data Analytics: an algorithm examines data created from the system and draws info that can improve the way our Customer Management System program our daily clinical schedule. Conclusions. ROBOTA can help to achieve the goal of reducing contamination risks and errors, ensuring at the same time higher level of sterilization. P11 Jaw elevator muscles activity and pain on palpation with clear aligners. A prospective observational study Alessandro Nota, Atanaz Darvizeh, Simona Tecco Correspondence: Alessandro Nota (dr.alessandro.nota@gmail.com) University Vita and Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy Abstract Background. It is not clear, from the available literature, whether the orthodontic treatment with clear aligners, which has a not negligible thickness between the dental arches, is accompanied by adaptive changes in the electrical activity of the jaw elevator muscles. The aim of this study was to report the jaw elevator muscles activity and their pain on palpation during the early stages of orthodontic dental alignment with clear aligners. Methods. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and pain level on muscle palpation of masseter and anterior temporalis muscles, were recorded in a sample of 16 adult subjects (18-32 years old; mean 22.5 +/- 3.5 SD) undergoing to orthodontic treatment with clear aligners, Data were recorded before the treatment (T0), after 1 month of treatment (two clear aligners) (T1), and after 3 months of treatment (T2). Results. No statistically significant differences in muscular pain were observed over the time in the whole sample. At T1, in the test group, the electrical activity in the masseter area at mandibular rest position showed a statistically significant reduction respect to the baseline values, but after 3 months (T2), data appeared similar to T0 (p=0.03 and p=0.02). Conclusions. During the early stages of an orthodontic treatment with clear aligners, the subjects could experience an initial reduction of the basal electrical activity of jaw elevator muscles, which tends to disappear quickly. The behavior of the muscles during the orthodontic dental alignment deserves to be investigated in the future because preliminary data indicate a certain muscular adaptation to orthodontic movements, that could occur at least during the very early stages of treatment with aligners. P12 Comparison of the accuracy of 3-dimensional printed dental models manufactured with different additive technologies Török Gréta, Borbély Judit, Hermann Péter, Barbara Kispélyi Department of Prosthodontics, Semmelweis, Budapest, Hungary Correspondence: Török Gréta (drtorokgreta@gmail.com) Abstract Background. There are several different types of three-dimensional 3D printing technology that are appropriate for constructing dental models. In some cases, the cast has only a holder and carrier function during the whole digital workflow. Models with dies manufactured by additive technology can be used during the construction of extended fixed partial denture. The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess the accuracy (precision and trueness) of 3D printed dental models and models with removable dies manufactured with scan LED technology (SLT) and stereolithography (SLA) and PolyJet printers. Methods. A digital upper jaw model serves as a reference. In the initial model, the 15 and 16 teeth are missing, the 11, 14 and 17 teeth are prepared with supragingival chamfer preparation for fixed prosthetic appliance. The 26 tooth was prepared for inlay. To standardize the measurements 16 markers (1 mm diameter) were created on the digital model. After designing the reference markers the model was sectioned to get a model with removable dies using 3Shape Model Builder program. The physical dental models were printed 3 types of 3D printers and printed 5 times with each printer. 1. SLA technology (FormLabs Form2 printer, Dental Model Resin, with layer thicknesses 50 μm). 2. SLT technique (MediTech D30 printer, FotoDent Model material, layer thickness 50 μm) 3. PolyJet technique (Objet Eden 350V 3D printer, VeroFlexWhite, layer thickness 14 μm). The 3D printed models and sectioned models were scanned using a high-resolution industrial 3D scanner (3D System) within two weeks after printing. The accuracy of 3D scanning is ± 0,05 mm. The scanned models were saved as stl format and imported into the Geomagic Verify software to analyse the precision and trueness of 3D printers. After the superimposition, the whole deviation and distances between predefined reference points were measured with a digital calliper. Measurements for the 3 types of printed models were compared with the initial digital model. The deviation of 50 μm has been defined as the allowed deviation interval in prosthetic aspect. Results. The accuracy of the investigated Objet, Meditech D30 and FormLabs Form2 printers is within the allowed deviation interval. Conclusions. Within the limitation of this study it was concluded that PolyJet, SLT and SLA technologies are able to fabricate a clinically acceptable physical model that is essential for construction of high-precision fixed prosthetic appliances.

Vilnius, Lithuania Correspondence: Pletkus Justinas (justinas.pletkus@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Since IOS devices can only capture part of the object at a time, images have to be stitched together to form a 3D object and therefore it is the source of possible errors of the scan. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the trueness and precision of three different IOS scanning partially and fully edentulous models with 2 or 4 implants with attached scan bodies and digital splints. Methods. Two types of maxilla models were printed with AsigaMax 3D printer. The first model was missing both premolars and molars on the right side, so Straumann BL dental implants were inserted instead first premolar (straight) and second molar (tilted 20°mesially). Four implants were inserted in the second edentulous model symmetrically at second incisors (straight) and first molar areas (tilted 20° mesially). Scan bodies were attached to the implants and models were scanned with Nikon Altera 10.7.6. coordinate measurement machine (CMM) to form a reference scan. DII was taken with a Primescan (version 5.0.1), CS 3600 (version 3.1.0), Trios3 (version 1.18.2.10) IOS ten times each (n=10) without digital splint. After that, tablets of hardened Fuji Plus cement was glued in edentulous areas to form digital splint and all models were scanned with three different IOS. Scanning data was exported in standard tessellation language format for analysis. All scans were aligned on the reference scan precisely by applying best-fit alignment procedure. Distance and angulation between scan bodies were measured aligning CAD models of scan bodies to the scanned surfaces of scan bodies. Results. Trueness of distance and angle in Carestream partially edentulous models was 185 μm in the group with splint and 280 μm without one and 0.22° in the group with splint and 0.29° in the group without respectively. Precision of distance and angle measurements in the splint groups were 87 μm and 0.13°, in the groups without-202 μm and 0.25°. In fully edentulous models trueness of distance varied 53-106 μm in the groups with splint and 67-8μm in the groups without. Trueness of Primescan in partially edentulous models with splints was 21μm and 0.16° in distance and angular measurements. Without splints-27μm and 0.21°. For fully edentulous models trueness and precision of distance and angle was better n groups with splint than without. Trueness of distance and angle of Trios3 in partially edentulous splinted models was 15 μm and 0.3°; 53 μm and 0.11° in unsplinted models respectively. For fully edentulous splinted models trueness of distance and angle varied 32-122μm and 0.19-0.51°, for unsplinted models-17-80μm and 0.1-0.45°. Conclusions. Primescan showed the best results of trueness and precision of distance and angle measurements. Since digital splints improve the accuracy of DII, the impact of their forms and materials should be more researched. P14 Effect of intraoral scanner, printer and digital analog system on accuracy of 3D printed models L. Auskalnis1, D. Jegelevičius2,3, M. Akulauskas2, A. Gedrimiene4, T. Simonaitis5, R. Jurgaityte5, Vygandas Rutkunas6 1Student, Institute of Odontology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, LITHUANIA; 2Engineer and Head of laboratory, Biomedical Engineering Institute, Kaunas University of Technology, LITHUANIA; 3Associate Professor, Department of Electronics Engineering, Kaunas University of Technology, LITHUANIA; 4PhD student, Department of Prosthodontics, Institute of Odontology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, LITHUANIA; 5Dental technician, UAB “ProDentum”, Vilnius, LITHUANIA; 6Associate Professor, Department of Prosthodontics, Institute of Odontology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, LITHUANIA Correspondence: Vygandas Rutkunas (vygandasr@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Digital workflow for producing implant-supported restorations involves the usage of intraoral scanners (IOS). From IOS data 3D printed master model is often fabricated using the selected type of digital analogs. There is a lack of data regarding the effects of IOS, 3D printer, and digital analog type on the local and global accuracy of digital analog positions in 3D printed master model. Moreover, errors arising in each step/stage should be identified. Methods. Two Straumann BLT 4.1 mm RC implants were inserted in the reference model (REF) left quadrant, in the location of second premolar with 0° angulation and second molar with 5° angulation. Three calibration spheres of 5 mm in diameter (±1 μm) where placed on the left quadrant at the model base. Scan bodies (3Shape) were attached to the implants and model was scanned with Nikon Altera 10.7.6. industrial scanner (REF-stl). REF model was scanned 10 times with E3 (3Shape) scanner for validation. Ten digital impressions were taken with Trios3 (3Shape) intraoral scanner (IOS-stl). The closest to the overall average of intraoral digital impressions STL file was selected for 3D printing. Asiga MAX and Next Dent 5100 3D printers were used to duplicate the reference model. Two types of digital implant analog systems were placed into the models: ELOS Print Model Analog and NT-trading DIM-ANALOG. In total 4 groups containing 10 quadrant 3D printed models were created. Later models were scanned with a validated E3 scanner (3D-print-stl). STL file superimpositions and measurements were performed using Geomagic Control X 2018 software. Distance, vertical shift, rotation and angulation measurements were made locally and globally. Results. Validation procedure of E3 scanner showed the trueness of 26 μm and precision of 16.8 μm. Digital impression procedure with Trios 3 introduced 53 μm distance between the implants, 34.7 μm vertical shift, 0.283° angulation and 0.230° rotation errors locally. Comparison of REF_stl and 3D_print_stl files showed most accurate Asiga MAX and Elos PMA analog combination: 37.2 μm distance between the implants, 39.7 μm vertical shift, 0.212° angulation and 0.769° rotation errors locally. Majority of detected differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions. Asiga MAX 3D printer performed more accurately than NextDent 5100. ELOS Print Model Analog showed most accurate result both locally and globally than NT trading. Implant angulation of 5° provides more accurate analog position in the master model than 0° angulation. Intraoral scanning had significant influence in overall error propogation. Further studies are needed to evaluate other factors. P15 Assessment of distortion caused by stitching during full arch intraoral scanning János Vág, Evelin Kövér, Ákos Mikolicz, Zsolt Nagy Department of Conservative Dentistry, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary Correspondence: János Vág (drvagjanos@gmail.com) Abstract Background. The field of application of today’s intraoral scanners is extending from making single tooth restorations towards full arch rehabilitations. Scanning technique (scan pattern) are suggested to influence the scanning accuracy especially in case of full arch. The aim of this study was to measure distortion of 3D models created with full arch digital impressions by a novel method and compare with two existing methods. Methods. Maxillary and mandibular models were captured with an intraoral scanner using four different scan patterns. Accuracy and distortion were assessed by comparing master scans to the intraoral scans using the following three methods: 1: Mean surface deviation was measured after complete arch superimposition. 2: 28 points were selected identically on the experimental and on the master reference models. Deviation between identical points was assessed after superimposition over the complete arch. 3: (Novel technique) The same 28 points were compared after superimposition limited to the scanning origin. Results. Significant differences were found between the three different methods regardless of the arch and pattern. The overall mean deviation between identical points when models were aligned at the scanning origin was the highest and the mean deviation between the non-identical values was the lowest. The new method revealed local, tooth-wise differences between scan pattern as well as pattern of error increasing with distance from scanning origin. Conclusions. The new method better detects the cumulative deviation of stitching error in complete arch intraoral scans, and is suitable to investigate the effect of scanning pattern in a very sensitive manner. P16 Comparison of distortion of seven intraoral scanners caused by stitching mechanism Zsolt Nagy1, János Vág1, Anthony Mennito2, Walter Renne2 1Department of Conservative Dentistry, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; 2Department of Oral Rehabilitation, Medical University of South Carolina College of Dental Medicine, Charleston, South Carolina Correspondence: Zsolt Nagy (nagyzsolt.dent@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Usually full-arch accuracy of intraoral scanners (IOS) are measured by average deviation and does not taking into consideration the origin of scanning. However, during scanning, deviation is accumulating from the scanning origin till the last tooth on the arch. The aim of this work was to compare tooth wise kinetics of deviation of seven different IOS, all starting from the same scanning origin utilizing various hardware and software techniques. Methods. Test digital models were produced by IOS of 7 different types on a human cadaver maxilla. All scans were started on occlusal surface of tooth 27 and ended up at tooth 17. Superimposition of test models with a master model were done in GOM Inspect software using a local best fit algorithm localized at the scanning origin. Deviation was measured between identical points and accumulated deviation (AD) was calculated at tooth 17. Deviation was also calculated separately on three axis, mesio-distal, bucco-lingual and apico-coronal. Data was statistically analyzed by generalized linear mixed model. Results. The average full-arch deviation was 365±130 for CS, 535±116 for Element1, 247±27 for Element2, 320±48 for Emerald, 174±16 for Omnicam, 906±122 for Planscan, 156±25 for Trios3. AD was 524±92 for CS, 521±102 for Element1, 321±23 for Element2, 480±49 for Emerald, 408±21 for Omnicam, 1697±64 for Planscan, 235±18 for Trios3. These were not statistically different from each other except AD of Planscan which was significantly higher than all others. Deviation on apico-coronal axis at tooth 17 was higher than deviation measured on mesio-distal or bucco-lingual axis for Element2, Emerald, Omnicam, Planscan except CS, Element1 and Trios3. CS and Element1 had the highest coefficient of variation (56% and 79%) which might mask the difference in accuracy results. Conclusions. Further away from scanning origin higher deviation values for all IOS were found and with most scanners, the deviation at apico-coronal axis related to the occlusal view was the highest. This suggests that proper selection of the tooth and the surface of origin may help to reduce deviation. The accuracy was improved considerably by manufacturers at the new generation of the same brand. P17 Optical Properties of Monolithic CAD/CAM Zirconia Reinforced Lithium-Silicate Crowns Alexandra Czigola1, Zoltan Imre-Kovacs2, Peter Hermann1, Judit Borbely1 1Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Semmelweis University - Hungary – Budapest; 2Department of General Dental Preclinical Practice, Faculty of Dentistry, Semmelweis University - Hungary - Budapest Correspondence: Alexandra Czigola (czigola.alexandra@dent.semmelweis-univ.hu) Abstract Background. All‐ceramic systems and CAD/CAM technics allow dentists to make monolithic restorations with reduced wall thickness. Glass‐ceramic restorations are in the focus of interest. When the right color block of glass-ceramic material is selected for the restoration it must be taken into consideration, that the final esthetics are influenced by underlying tooth color due to their translucency. The aim of this in vitro study was to determine how substrate colors, ceramic thickness and translucency, cement shades effect the final shade of CAD/CAM monolithic zirconia reinforced lithium-silicate (VITA Suprinity) crowns. Methods. According to our previously published study1premolar teeth (14) were prepared on a study model for 1.0 and 1.5-mm thick full ceramic monolithic crowns. Intraoral scanner was used (Trios, 3Shape) to create digital impressions. CAD/CAM technics were used to design (Dental Designer) and make crowns with identical shape and size. Shade A1 crowns were milled (Everest, Kavo) from HT (high translucency) and T (translucent) Vita Suprinity (Vita Zahnfabrik) zirconia reinforced lithium-silicate blocks. 9 substrates were made of different color and materials (6 of Vita Simulate composite material and zirconia, Co-Cr, gold-colored alloy) to imitate substrate effects on the final shade. Three different try-in pastes were used to simulate the color effect of cements (Variolink Esthetic Try-In paste, Ivoclar). Shade measurement was done 3 times for each crown by spectrophotometer (Vita, Easyshade Advance) and averages were compared to a reference crown (A1, 1.5mm, T, 2M3S abutment, neutral try-in paste). ΔE00was calculated (CIEDE 2000 formula). Results. All of the examined parameters influenced ΔE00of the CAD/CAM monolithic crowns. The weakest effect was exerted by the color of the try-in paste. When ∆E value smaller than 1.8 is regarded as a clinically not acceptable color change2, out of 108 measured combinations none of the HT and 19 of T crowns were below this threshold. Conclusions. Before choosing the ceramic block translucency and restoration wall thickness we should consider the underlying abutment color, but final color was just barely affected by luting cement shade in case of 1.0 and 1.5 mm thick ceramic crowns. Clinics P18 Post-Extractive Implant Placement in Upper Molar region: Implant Preparation Guided by Dental Roots Christian Monti (monti.christian@libero.it) Lake Como Institute, Como (ITA); Dental Student, University of Varese, Italy Abstract Background. The correct positioning of post-extractive implants in the upper posterior area is always a challenge, especially because of the maxillary sinus presence.The aim is therefore to propose, in selected cases, after a careful CT analysis, to use the roots themselves as an insertion-guide in order to obtain a clinical success. Methods. A 45-years-old woman presented an important vestibular recession and a palatal fracture of element 16, requiring a morpho-functional restoration through implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. A CBCT was performed to evaluate the root trunk anatomy, the presence of inter-radicular bone and the maxillary sinus physiology. The 3D images showed divergent roots with a well-represented bone septum.In order to avoid drill off-setting through axial vibration, because not properly supported during the insertion, it was decided to prepare the implant site before extracting the roots: the tooth was uncrowned and the roots, thanks to their density and inclination, forming an effective guide for the correct three-dimensional osteotomy. The roots were then atraumatically removed, and the implant inserted.To avoid any buccal-bone resorption, a L-PRF Collagen Block was introduced in the peri-implant gap. Results. A correct osseo-integration of the implant was documented, as well as an excellent response of the peri-implant tissues in the follow-up carried out in the two years succeeding the placement. A gingival re-modeling was achieved with the disappearance of the vestibular recession, because of the wound being allowed to heal by secondary intention and using the L-PRF membranes as a tissue healing boost. Conclusions. The illustrated procedure remains a valid alternative, although not a substitute, of traditional surgical techniques which are already fully described in literature. This particular site preparation has allowed the obtainment of a perfect implant axis, a predictable implant positioning and osteo-integration, favoring the success of the implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. P19 Fractured Premolar Replacement with Post-Extraction Implant and Immediate Loading with Guided Gingival Recession Regeneration - Fully Digital in Office Fabrizio Pedrinis1, Jessica Dana2 1Dental Studio Digitale – Via Pelli 13B Lugano (CH); 2Dental Student, University of Varese, Italy Correspondence: Fabrizio Pedrinis (fabrizio@pedrinis.ch) Abstract Background. The replacement of the first upper premolar of a patient who showed up with a root fracture, with a post-extraction implant; delivering also a temporary crown in the same session, which aims a spontaneous gingival regeneration of the pre-existing buccal recession, for an additional aesthetic rehabilitation. Methods. The CBCT confirmed the radicular fracture and showed a bone structure with a conserved vestibular theca that allowed the insertion of an implant right after the extraction. This 3D radiological exam was imported into the RealGuide (3Diemme) implant design software together with the dental arches scan obtained with the Omnicam intraoral camera (Sirona). The ideal positioning of the fixture was planned with the same RealGuide software, as well as the surgical guide which was designed and printed in office with a Form2 printer (Formlabs). The extraction was performed in an atraumatic way and a 4 x 13 mm Megagen implant was placed with the help of the surgical guide. The ISQ value was 78, which confirmed the good primary stability. In the same session a temporary PMMA crown was formed with the Cerec Chairside method (Sirona). Particular attention was paid to the creation of an S-shaped emergency profile in order to promote gingival regeneration. Results. The implant was well osseo-integrated and after 3 months it was possible to observe a great gingival regeneration, which is always a prerequisite for a stable, aesthetic and functional result. Conclusions. The fully-digital procedure performed entirely in office allowed the replacement of the fractured tooth within 2 hours. Thanks to the three-dimensional positioning guided according faithfully to the planification, and because of an accurate emergence profile design, a spontaneous gingival regeneration without any connective grafts was also obtained. P20 Full Mouth Restoration with Immediate Loading Alessandro Perucchi1, Christian Monti2, Jessica Dana3, Marco Del Prete4 1Studio Odontoiatrico Dr.Alessandro Perucchi – Mendrisio (CH); 2Lake Como Institute, Como, Italy; 3Dental Student, University of Varese, Italy; 4Private Practice, Lugano, Switzerland Correspondence: Alessandro Perucchi (alessandroperucchi@sunrise.ch) Abstract Background. To rehabilitate both jaws of a patient in bad oral conditions is already a challenge in itself. It was intentional to try a motivational training in order to obtain the perfect prerequisites for an implant-prosthetic rehabilitation with a digital workflow.Methods. A woman showed up with a poor oral hygiene, without been going to any dentist for 6 years. She went through a depression and was hospitalized for a year. Hence her desire to fix her teeth in a definitive way, in order to smile again.All the periodontal upper teeth were firstly extracted, and a removable prosthesis was delivered. Short after that her oral situation went really better, that’s why it was decided to subsequently rehabilitate the mandibular arch with a Toronto prosthesis immediate loaded on 6 post-extractive Megagen implants, all digitally planned.Considering that her oral hygiene was definitively ameliorated, it was chosen to deliver also in the upper jaw a fixed prosthetic solution immediately loaded on six BLX implants. The vertical dimension was reproduced with a digital wax up, and on the six BLX implants were screwed six SRA (screw retained abutment). Results. The patient has shown to have definitively improved her oral hygiene, and for this reason there are all the good conditions for a long-term maintenance of the implants. After a year she is very glad, satisfied and has finally returned to smile without being ashamed of her appearance. Conclusions. With the digital workflow it has been possible to deliver on both jaws an immediate prosthesis in a very short time. The result is extremely satisfying, since it was not only a technical and clinical challenge, but also a matter of caring this lady on a path of personal growth and reconquering her self-esteem. P21 Development of an evidence-based application for dental grinding evaluation and sleep bruxism monitoring Patricia Tersi, Cristiane Macedo Department of Evidence-Based Medicine, Paulista Medical School, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Correspondence: Patricia Tersi (drapatriciatersi@gmail.com) Abstract Background. There are issues not clarified in the sleep bruxism (SB) field, some of them are associated to the present restrictions related to validity, sensitivity, specificity and poor correspondence between instrumental and non-instrumental diagnostic approaches. The current challenge is to establish more accurate, applicable, affordable and accessible approaches. Aim: The aim of this study is to present and recommend the use of an innovative and technological smartphone-based approach for SB assessment. It is an evidence-based toll for tooth grinding evaluation and long-term sleep bruxism monitoring, enabling systematic data collection from SB self-report (I), clinical inspection (II) and tooth wear pattern (III). Methods. The application uses principles of Artificial Intelligence (AI), bruxism consensus grade system statement and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to collect data from non-instrumental approaches with literature supported questions about self-report and clinical inspections. The image processing algorithms developed measure data from tooth wear pattern and its possible association with symptoms, comorbidities and risk factors. Results. The findings of this study resulted in a smartphone-based approach for multifactorial SB assessment. With cloud storage, the data from this app can be used for clinical and research purposes. Conclusions. This APP is an applicable and accessible approach for SB assessment, with algorithms that can contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between clinical assessment, self-report and tooth wear measurements. P22 From intraoral scan to CAD-CAM no-prep partial veneers: a case report Veronica Campana1, Giada Goffredo2, Luciano Laveglia3, Stefano Ponti4 1Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 2DDs, Private Practitioner, Varese, Italy; 3Dentistry Student, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; 4DDs, Private Practitioner, Varese, Italy Correspondence: Veronica Campana (v.campana@studenti.uninsubria.it) Abstract Background. To present the esthetic and orthodontic outcome of multiple lithium disilicate ceramic partial veneers, produced through a full digital process that includes an IOS impression and the computer-aided design/manufacturing phases. In this case report the advantages of this digital technique are presented. Methods. A digital scan was taken with 3Shape TRIOS 3 Intraoral Scanner (1). Data were sent to the digital laboratory service where the veneers were designed using CAD/CAM design software (3shape dental system) and milled (2) from low translucency IPS e.max lithium disilicate (Vita A3) blocks (Ivoclar-Vivadent, Amherst, NY, USA) with a four axes milling machine (Vhf N4). A minimum thickness of 0.3 mm for the veneer and of 0.1 for the margins were set. A virtual marginal design was performed (3), checking with a 2D cross section the accuracy of the positioning of the veneer closing margin. The direction of insertion of the veneer was also designed and the occlusion was controlled through a virtual articulator. Veneers were then verified intraorally using a translucent try-in paste (Multilink Automix Try In, Ivoclar-Vivadent). All internal surfaces of the veneers were etched with 5% hydrofluoric acid for 25 seconds and silanated (Monobond Plus, Ivoclar-Vivadent). After conditioning the teeth surfaces with a primer (Multilink primer base/catalyst Ivoclar-Vivadent) the laminate veneers were cemented using a translucent light-cure resin cement (Multilink Automix Ivoclar-Vivadent). An occlusal check was performed, revealing the absence of interfering contact points both in protrusive and laterality. The study was conducted in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee at Insubria University. Results. The adaption and cementation to the teeth surfaces was clinically easy due to a well-designed planning phase that included not only the selection of the margin but also the detection of the axis of insertion: when this axis was involved in an undercut area, the software reports the error such to modify the design of the veneer. The aesthetic outcome of the lithium disilicate veneers was natural-looking and conservative, while providing high optical properties. Conclusions. No-prep adhesive restorations are an excellent rehabilitative option for situations in which the dental elements are healthy and can be modified exclusively by an additive plane of treatment, for example if there is a need to compensate the limitations of an orthodontic treatment. The digital workflow allowed the fabrication of satisfying clinical results in terms of marginal fit, shape and aesthetics. Science P23 Application of intraoral scanner to identify monozygotic twins Botond Simon1, János Vág2, Ádám D. Tárnoki3, Dávid L. Tárnoki3 1SCRUNCH Ltd., Budapest, Hungary; 2Department of Conservative Dentistry, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; 3Department of Radiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary Correspondence: Botond Simon (dr.simon.botond@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Current methods for identify the monozygotic (MZ) twinning are either invasive such as blood sample taking or expensive as DNA sequencing. Palatal rugae has been suggested previously as a marker of human identity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 3D digital pattern of the palatum and rugae acquired by intraoral scanner in order to distinguish identical monozygotic twins from one another and to differentiate MZ from dizygotic twins (DZ). Methods. Palatal area of 36 participants (MZ: 25; DZ: 11) was scanned three times with an intraoral scanner. The age of twins was between 18 and 60 years. Ethical approval was granted on July 26, 2018 by the Hungarian authority called Committee of the Health Registration and Training Center (approval number: 36699-2/2018/EKU). From the scanned data STL file was created and exported into GOM Inspect® inspection software. Each scan within a twin pair was superimposed to each other. The average deviation between scans of the same subject (reproducibility) and between scans of two subjects within a twin pair (intertwin comparison) were calculated with 95% confidence interval. Results. The mean reproducibility of the palatal scan was 33 μm (31-36 μm). The intertwin deviation of MZ was 361 μm (324-402 μm) which was significantly (p<0.001) higher than the reproducibility values. The deviation of dizygotic twin pairs was significantly higher (+642 μm, 491-838 μm, p<0.001) than the deviation of monozygotic pairs. Conclusions. MZ twins can be differentiated from each other accurately by palatal morphology obtained by intraoral scanner. This method may differentiate MZ and DZ twins as well but it requires further study. The alignment method is capable to identify monozygotic twin pairs. This could be a great advantage in forensic science and in twin studies. Clinics P24 The facilitated esthetic orthodontic treatment with clear aligners and minimally invasive corticotomy: the importance of digital planning Simona Tecco (simtecc@gmail.com) San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy Abstract Backround. During the last decades, accelerating orthodontic tooth movement, has become a topical issue and there have been many attempts to shorten treatment duration. Among the different techniques described in the literature, the corticotomy seem to be an effective and safe mean. Corticotomy is an intentional injury to the cortical bone able to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement and dramatically reduce treatment times because it leads to a biological stage called regional acceleratory phenomenon (RAP) characterized an intensified osteoclastic activity, resulting in osteopenia and increased bone modeling. Nevertheless recently, the piezocision technique was introduced, performed under local anesthesia through a tunnel approach overcoming most of the disadvantages of traditional corticotomy. Simultaneously, orthodontic treatment with removable clear aligners has become an increasingly common treatment choice because of adult patients that desire aesthetic and comfortable alternatives to conventional fixed appliances. Being aesthetics and treatment duration the principal adult patients expectations, the aim is to illustrate the planning of a combined approach with piezocision corticotomy and clear aligners orthodontic treatment. Methods. Two case reports are described, an open-bite and a closure of extraction spaces. After performing polyvinylsiloxane or digital impressions of the dental arches and sending it to the manufacturer a proper aligners orthodontic planning using the digital software (ClinCheck, Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA) the orthodontist identified the time window in which the most difficult orthodontic movements had to be performed. The surgical procedure was planned and executed as starting point of this period in which each aligner will be used for 4 days rather than 15 days for a total time of 4 months. A careful planning of the ideal attachments for correctly expressing the aligner execution of these movements was necessary. Results. Clinical results obtained were satisfactory results, as seen in figure 1 and figure 2 for the openbite and the space closure, respectively. Conclusions. In order to underwent to accelerated esthetic orthodontic treatment (AEOT) applying a corticotomy surgical technique to orthodontic clear aligners treatment (Invisalign, Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA), each subject should be carefully evaluated. A cone-beam computed tomography should be added to the standard orthodontic examination (anamnesis, extraoral and intraoral examination and photographs, dental casts, ortopantomography, cephalometry). The primary objective of this combination should be to facilitate difficult and less predictable orthodontic movement in addition to reduce the treatment duration, simultaneously, the long term risk of relapse should be reduced. P25 Implant open-flap and flapless placement using dynamic navigation: a pilot controlled clinical trial Gerardo Pellegrino (gerardo.pellegrino2@unibo.it) University of Bologna, Italy Abstract Background. Dynamic navigation is a computer-guided technique offering different advantages with respect to conventional free-hand implant insertion. Some of these are an accurate and prosthetic-based implant placement, the surgical time reduction and safe use of a less invasive surgical procedure, like the flapless technique. This technique allows a higher patients comfort but is more challenging and is usually associated with less accurate placement of the fixture with respect to an open-flap method. The aim of this controlled clinical trial is to investigate the accuracy of implant placement comparing open-flap and flapless technique using a dynamic navigation system. Methods.12 patients were consecutively recruited and allocated to the flapless or open-flap group depending on soft tissue parameters. Implant position was planned on the preoperative CBCT according to the prosthetic project using dedicated software. A total of 20 implants were placed: 11 with a flapless technique and 9 with the conventional open-flap method. The surgery was performed with the navigation system according to the virtual planning. The deviation between the real implant position obtained from the post-operative cone-beam computed tomography and the planned one was measured. Data were statistically analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results. The errors of implant placement using a flapless approach were 0.88 ± 0.50 mm (range 0.46-1.84 mm) at the insertion point and 1.09 ± 0.62 mm (range 0.48-2.28 mm) at the apical point. The depth error was 0.37 ± 0.29 mm (range 0.03-0.86 mm) and the angular deviation was 4.78 ± 2.58° (range 1-9.7°). Using a conventional open-flap technique, the errors were 1.06± 0. 48 mm (range 0.45-2.21 mm), 1.40 ± 0.58 mm (range 0.59-2.21 mm), 0.45 ± 0.37 mm (range 0.18-1.41 mm), and 7.13 ± 4.76° (range 1.4-15.9°), respectively. The values of the two groups were not significantly different (p = 0.43, p = 0.27, p = 0.59,p=0.20). No difference was found between the conventional open-flap and flapless approaches in terms of the accuracy of implant placement. Conclusions. Therefore, the use of a navigation system can overcome the drawback of a “blind” technique and ensure a high level of accuracy. P26 Conventional and tilted implants placement using dynamic navigation: a case series Gerardo Pellegrino (gerardo.pellegrino2@unibo.it) University of Bologna, Italy Abstract Background. Tilted implants are used instead of bone regenerative techniques, allowing a more conservative approach. Dynamic navigation is a computer-guided technique allowing accurate implant placement and safe use of minimally invasive surgical procedures, like flapless and tilted implant insertion. The aim of this study is to report a series of cases in which implant placement was performed using a dynamic navigation system combining tilted approach and flapless technique. The secondary objective was to assess implants placement accuracy. Methods. Three patients needing implant-prosthetic rehabilitation in the maxilla and having atrophy of the posterior area are treated (Ethics Committee approval number 104/2018/DISP/AUSLBO). For each patient, two implants (BTK, Biotec Srl, Italy) are planned, one of these tilted engaging the available alveolar bone and avoiding the maxillary sinus. The surgeries were performed with a dynamic navigation system (ImplaNav, BresMedical, Sydney, Australia) and all the implants were placed using a flapless approach. The implants were exposed after three months. The accuracy of implant placement was assessed measuring the deviations between the positioned and the planned implants comparing pre- and post-operative CBCT. Results. No complications occurred and both tilted and conventional implants reached the osseointegration. The mean deviations of implants placed with a conventional technique were 0.93 ± 0.61 mm at the insertion point, 1.27 ± 0.78 mm at the apical point and 0.42 ± 0.29 mm in depth. The angular deviation was 4.53 ± 2.44°. The mean deviations of tilted implants were 1.03 ± 0.64 mm at the insertion point, 1.39 ± 0.81 mm at the apical point and 0.43 ± 0.24 mm in depth. The angular deviation was 4.62 ± 2.94°. Conclusions. The use of dynamic navigation can be considered a reliable and safe technique in implantology. It allows the placement of implants using a conservative and safe approach even though more challenging procedures are performed. The accuracy values seem to be similar using a tilted or a conventional technique of implant placement. P27 Augmented reality for dynamic navigation displaying: a report of two cases Gerardo Pellegrino (gerardo.pellegrino2@unibo.it) University of Bologna, Italy Abstract Background. Dynamic navigation is a computer-guided surgery technique used in dental implantology. The employment of navigation systems offers different advantages, as accurate placement of the fixtures. Many authors reported good results in terms of implant placement accuracy using this method. A drawback of this technique is the need to turn away from the surgical field to look at the monitor of the navigation system. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology employed in different surgical fields, as neurosurgery, vascular surgery, and maxillofacial surgery. Nevertheless, only few dentistry studies are available to date. The aim of this study was to present two clinical cases of navigated implant surgery associated with the use of augmented reality and to report the accuracy of implant placement using both the devices. Methods. Two patients needing implant-supported rehabilitation in the upper premolar area were treated. Implant position was planned on the preoperative CBCT according to the prosthetic project using dedicated software. For each patient, an implant (WinSix, Ancona, Italy; Straumann, Switzerland) was placed by the same surgeon using a dynamic navigation system (ImplaNav, BresMedical, Sydney, Australia) and AR glasses (Fifthingenium, Milan, Italy). Results. The navigation system allowed the operator to see the implant planning and to follow drills and implant position on the CBCT of the patient. With the association of the augmented reality device, the navigation screen was directly displayed near the surgical field. Both the implants were placed with a flapless technique. The accuracy of implant placement was evaluated measuring into CBCTs the deviation between real and planned positions of the implants. The deviation values for the first implant were 0.53 mm at the entry point and 0.50 mm at the apical point; for the second implant were 0.46 mm at the entry point and 0.48 mm at the apical point. The angular deviations were respectively 3.05° and 2.19°. Conclusions. The use of AR glasses allowed the surgeon to have at the same time both the view of the surgical field and the position of the virtual drills without the need to turn away from the working position. The use of augmented reality applied to dynamic navigation allowed a reduced operating time and led to accurate values of implant placement. The association of these two technologies seems to be promising in dental implantology. More studies are needed to confirm these results. P28 Esthetic performance of different CAD/CAM all-ceramic implant-supported crowns via digital workflows in the esthetic zone: a case report Krisztina Mikulas1, Tamás Chikány2, Peter Hermann1 1Department of Prosthodontics Semmelweis University, Maxdental - Hungary – Budapest; 2Intellident - Hungary – Budapest Correspondence: Krisztina Mikulas (dr.mikulas@gmail.com, mikulas.krisztina@dent.semmelweis-univ.hu) Abstract Background. Successful esthetic outcome in implant rehabilitation can be resulted through accurate implant placement, management of supraimplant soft tissues and appropriate biomaterials. Provisional restorations (PR) have a decisive role in soft‐tissue contouring and preservation during maturation period after implant placement. Correct 3D capturing of the supraimplant emergence profile of PR allow predictable definitive restorations. This case report follows a recently known indirect scanning technique recommended in case of rapidly collapsed supraimplant mucosa and based on production of three different anterior all-ceramic implant-supported crowns via complete or semi digital workflow. Methods. At baseline a 49 year old female patient with fracture of tooth 22 was treated. Immediate implant placement (BL, Straumann AG) was performed in a correct palatal and apico-coronal position, buccal gap was grafted with xenograft (Creos, Nobel Biocare AG). Immediate provisionalisation was carried out chairside. After healing period and creating harmonious supraimplant emergence profile we performed intraoral digital impression (CARES Intraoral Scanner) generating standard triangulation language files (STL) based on three digital impressions. The merged file of STL1, 2, 3 was used to design CAD/CAM abutments made of Y-TZP (Straumann CARES), single crowns and then a 3D stereolithographic model was printed for the semi-digital way. Two different CAD/CAM abutments were designed and milled for three different all-ceramic restorations. The outcome variables were the esthetic outcomes of the three all-ceramic crowns. Firstly a cement-retained monolithic zirconia crown on individualized CAD/CAM abutment was fabricated via complete digital workflow without any physical model. Next cement-retained pressed ceramic crown (IPS e.max CAD HT) was performed. Finally a one-piece screw-retained single crown based on CAD/CAM abutment veneered with hand buildup technique was delivered, which was finally inserted after the esthetic evaluation. Results. The esthetic outcomes (PES and WES values) were pleasing overall for the three all-ceramic restorations. Conclusions. Ideal shaping of provisional at immediate implant placement helps stabilize the bone graft material within the blood clot during healing and develop the desired emergence profile. The individualized zirconia abutment may provide an ideal surface for soft tissue adhesion with less plaque accumulation. Both complete digital and semi digital prosthetic pathways resulted in appropriate clinical performance in the esthetic zone and simplified the clinical procedures.

Agenesis of teeth is one of the most common of human developmental anomalies. Oligodontia is the congenital agenesis of 6 or more permanent teeth.Multidisciplinary treatment approach calls for pre-prosthetic orthodontic space opening for proper positioning of the missing teeth and correction of inter-maxillary relations.High-quality CAD/CAM materials processed by digital workflow offer predictable and reliable treatment options for surgical and prosthetic phases of therapy. Methods. A 23-year old girl presented with oligodontia and no stable occlusion in premolar, molar region. Two years of orthodontic treatment created space for implant placement but stable occlusion could not be achieved. Diagnostic wax-up was made on casts mounted on articulator (Kavo Protar 5B, Kavo Dental Gmbh, Germany) programmed to individual patient parameters.Optical impression (TRIOS 3, 3Shape, Denmark) was taken as prepreparation scan to record occlusal morphology and contour of crowns. Mock-up served as a guide to follow a minimal invasive preparation approach. Prepared teeth scan was aligned under prepreparation scan and fit to occlusal morphology. Following adhesive cementation of milled hybridceramic occlusal veneers (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik, Germany) and stabilizing occlusion digital workflow was used for fixed implant rehabilitation. Results. A prosthetic-driven backward implant planning and guided implant placement (AstraTech EV Implant System, diameter 3 mm, DentsplySirona Implants, Sweden)(SMART Guide, dicomLAB, Hungary) was performed. The protocol required conventional impression and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), the superimposition of dental-gingival information on bone anatomy, surgical planning, 3D-printed teeth-supported surgical templates, and implant placement. After 3 months optical impression was carried out to detect 3D implant position to digitally design temporary crowns(Vita CadTemp, Vita Zahnfabrik, Germany) and soft tissue conditioning was done slightly by flow resin composite. After creating harmonious supraimplant emergence profile intraoral scan was taken and customized titanium-nitride abutments and milled zirconia cut-back crowns (Atlantis, Dentsply Sirona Implants, Sweden) were delivered. Model manufacturing was performed using a 3D printer and screw retained veneered ceramic crowns attached to implants. Conclusions. This article describes a conventional protocol for creating a mock up to preview esthetics and create proper occlusion using individually programmed articulator and digital workflow of milled occlusal veneers and implant supported crowns for predictable esthetic and reliable functional result.

During the development of CAD/CAM technology in dentistry, numerous new ceramic material were introduced for monolithic restorations. Improved optical features of the materials make it possible to produce monolithic restorations also in esthetic region. Reduced wall thickness compared to veneered restorations allows minimally invasive preparation. Chairside design and production unnecessiates 3D printed model. The aim of the study was to describe the chairside CAD/CAM method of making a monolithic crown in the esthetic region with minimally invasive preparation and to compare esthetic features and wall thickness of different material selection: monolithic zirconia, hybridceramic and glass-ceramic. Methods. A 17-year old girl presented with the need of an esthetic solution for her microdont maxillary central incisor after orthodontic treatment. A minimally invasive treatment concept was used with 0,6 mm reduction. After the rounded shoulder preparation an intraoral scan was taken by Trios POD Wireless scanner. (TRIOS, 3Shape, Denmark) Monolithic crown was designed in 3Shape Design Studio chairside software with the mirroring technique of the contralateral first incisor. Because of the limited space, materials were selected which can be produced with 0,8 mm wall thickness: 1. 1. hybrid ceramic (VITA Enamic HT Multilayer) 2. 2. zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic (VITA Suprinity PC HT) 3. 3. high-translucency zirconia (VITA YZ HT Color) 4. 4. medium-transucency zirconia (Ivoclar IPS e.max ZirCAD MT Multilayer) 5. 5. low-translucency zirconia (Ivoclar IPS e.max ZirCAD LT) During the production, the instructions of the manufacturers and clinically proven facts according to the minimum wall thickness were followed. Prosthodontists were asked to compare the crowns using Pink Esthetic Score and White Esthetic Score (PES/WES). Result. On the basis of the prosthodontists’ comparision and patient choice, the zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass ceramic crown had been cemented with adhesive technique. Conclusions. According to this study it seems that the optical features of the monolithic zirconia and hybrid ceramic restorations in the anterior region are not satisfying yet. Only zirconia and hybrid ceramics can be used in minimally invasive case of 0,8 mm according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Glass-ceramic is not indicated under 1,2 mm circumferential and 1,5 incisal wall thickness. However clinical experiences proved, that with adhesive cementation of a glass-ceramic crown, the reduction is allowed, so the most esthetic zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic could be cemented.

An observational study Francesca Cattoni, Atanaz Darvizeh, Vincenzo Sanci, Simona Tecco University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, IR.C.C.S. Ospedale San Raffaele - Italy - Milano Correspondence: Simona Tecco (simtecc@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Recently, the roles of occlusion and masticatory muscles have become fundamental in dental rehabilitations. The mockup is used to pre-visualize the final rehabilitations and it can be utilised to test both esthetic and functional patterns before realising the final treatment. The aim of this observational study was to investigate the impact on masticatory muscles by means of measuring electromyographic activity and making a comparison between computer-aided designed/manufactured mockup (digital mockup) and traditional mockup. Methods. The sample included 22 adult patients, aged 20 to 55 years who were about to receive a prosthetic rehabilitation and did not have any signs of periodontal or systemic disease. A digital or traditional mockup was made for each of the patients. Electromyographic activity of masticatory muscles were evaluated before initiating the treatment (T0), after the mockup insertion (T1), and after treatment (T2) by using the occlusal contact analyzer software called Teethan (Teethan s.p.a., Garbate Milanese, Milan, Italy). Results. Analysis of parameters at different times for both groups revealed significant variations for most of parameters. The analysis of traditional group revealed a significant variation in POC AT and IMP at “T0 vs. T1” and “T0 vs. T2”, BAR at “T0 vs. T2” and TOT at all 3 time comparisons. In digital group, POC MM and TORS at “T1 vs. T2” and “T0 vs. T2”, BAR at “T0 vs. T1” and “T0 vs. T2” and TOT at all 3 time comparisons showed a significant difference. The comparison between the two groups (traditional and digital) at different time gaps revealed that at ∆1 (T1-T0) only POC AT and IMP showed significant differences and no other significant variation was observed between the two groups at ∆2 (T2-T1) and ∆3 (T2-T0). It concludes that traditional and digital methods generally have nonsignificant differences. Conclusions. Useful reduction in working time and higher degree of precision in fabrication process of mockup can be obtained by applying the digital technique. Therefore new technological advancement can greatly assist the operator, with a substantially valuable impact. But for ensuring the final restoration of a muscular symmetric function both traditional and digital methods can still be considered to be effective and applicable procedures. Science P32 Eagle syndrome: a rare case of calcified ligament with an articulated structure inside Simona Tecco (simtecc@gmail.com) San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy Abstract Background. Eagle syndrome, or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament, is a rare condition characterized by a mineralization of Mineralization of the stylohyoid ligament occurs infrequently and is usually only an incidental finding noted on routine radiographic examination. Eagle syndrome is diagnosed only when the facial or neck pain originates from a stylohyoid ligament that is calcified. This clinical presentation was identified in 1937 by W.W. Eagle. From a radiographic perspective, Eagle syndrome may be a common incidental finding on routine panoramic radiographs, although only a very small percentage of patients with calcified stylohyoid ligaments present with clinically significant symptoms. Currently, the use of computed tomography (CT) or cone beam CT (CBCT) scanning, with or without three-dimensional reconstruction, is essential to establish an Eagle syndrome diagnosis and to appropriately plan individual patient management. Methods. This paper reports a case of Eagle syndrome individuated with a CBCT 3D reconstruction, and reviews the literature regarding management options for Eagle syndrome. A case-report of an adult Caucasian patient is reported. The patient has referred to a private practice office in Milan, due to a Temporomandibular joint disorder with neck pain. A complete examination with also a CBCT scanning revealed the presence of an articulated calcified stylohyoid ligament, very particular due to the particular articulation, similar to a knee useful to maintain a mobility of the ligament. Results. Eagle syndrome may be appropriately diagnosed via a detailed history, physical examination, and radiological evaluation. CBCT and 3D digital reconstructions represent the main diagnostic tool. Conclusions. This disease process can be confused with many other conditions that must be excluded in the differential diagnosis, mostly through 3D digital reconstructions, to allow appropriate prompt patient management. Clinics P33 Digital Orthodontics: Technology in Modern Practice Alessandro Nota, Darvizeh Atanaz, Valter Firbo, Simona Tecco University Vita- Salute San Raffaele, Milan Italy Correspondence: Alessandro Nota (dr.alessandro.nota@gmail.com) Abstract Background. The aim of this study is to describe the integration of technology with clinical orthodontics. New digital technologies appear essential to the success of any orthodontic practice seeking to increase efficiency and communication. The aim of the present study is to describe a practical digital workflow in clinical orthodontics. Methods. A useful workflow to integrate digital impression, model storage, orthodontic treatment planning, and customizing the orthodontic appliances with the support of a dental laboratory is described. Advantages are exposed, and limits are discussed, with a particular focus on the clinical point of view. Results. Digital technology could enhance the ability of the orthodontist to diagnose and treatment plan, using high resolution graphics and model analysis measurements. It also could allow the orthodontist to easily interact with the laboratory, improving the final satisfaction of the patients. Conclusions. A whole digital workflow appears particularly useful in orthodontics also to reduce estimates costs for manufacturing of oral appliances. P34 Effectiveness of Shade Measurement Using Intraoral Scanner Compared with Digital Spectrophotometer and Visual Shade Assessment Ivett Roth (yvettroth@gmail.com) Semmelweiss University, Budapest, Hungary Abstract Background. In digital shade measurement digital spectrophotometer is used as a gold standard. New intraoral scanner system was developed with a tool for teeth shade measurement, but there is less information about its efficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate shade measurement function of a digital scanning system in relation to visual shade determination and digital spectrophotometric device. Methods. 10 dental students from Semmelweis University took digital impressions and measured tooth shade for 10 different patients using 3Shape Trios intraoral scanner (TR). Students also selected shade using 2 visual methods: Vita A1-D4 (VC) and Vita Linearguide 3D-Master (LG) shade guides and an instrumental method: Vita Easyshade (ES). The study was ethically approved by the Semmelweis University Institutional Review Board (SE-TUKEB 61/2016). The inclusion criteria of patients were full dentition and no prosthetic restorative treatment. Students had no previous experience in intraoral scanning and tooth color matching, they attended an education course: lecture and training on intraoral scanning and shade matching methods with shade tabs and digital devices. The students matched the color of 3 teeth for each patient: 11 – cervical, central, incisal, 14 – central, 16 – central. Time spent on shade matching were recorded. For each tooth there was a VC shade- tab, an LG shade- tab and LG-shade tab according to ES measurement. Four selected shade tabs were presented to the patient, the student and an experienced dentist to select the best match. The results were recorded and evaluation of percentage was calculated. Results. The percentages of the selected best matching shade tabs out of the 4 methods: LG: 35,08%, ES: 26,58%, TR: 21,64%, VC: 16,7%. Time spent on shade matching by the 4 different shade matching methods: ES: 14,12 sec, TR:40,06 sec, VC: 52,42 sec, LG: 70,47 sec. Conclusions. Intraoral scanner (TR) was acceptable for shade measurement. In case of digital impression taking using another device for shade matching wasn’t necessary, color results were showed automatically. The fastest shade matching procedure was digital spectrophotometer (ES) followed by intraoral scanner. Most “best fit shade tabs” were selected with visual method (LG). Shade selection with visual method took the most time. P35 A sport injury of the left mandibular angle in a young adult allows to discover a morphological alteration of the other condyle. A case report Atanaz Darvizeh, Alessandro Nota, Simona Tecco University Vita- Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy Correspondence: Atanaz Darvizeh (atanazdarvizeh@gmail.com) Abstract Background. The purpose of this work is to present a clinical case in which digital image analysis has allowed a more accurate diagnosis in the context of Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) Methods. The clinical case of a patient who presented himself to our observation due to a sports trauma (a calcium) directed to the left mandibular angle, is described. Immediately after trauma, the patient was hospitalized in a maxillofacial unit of another structure, where he was subjected to a two-jaws block in protruded mandibular position for a period of some weeks, after which he has been resigned. After some months, he has turned to our structure for signs and symptoms of TMD, and malocclusion. The patient was prescribed an RMI of the Temporo-mandibular joints, a CBCT and routine investigations. Results. The analysis of digital records allowed the diagnosis of a morphological anomaly of the right condyle, which had not been detected previously, since at the maxillofacial department only an analysis of the left side (involved in the trauma) has been performed Conclusions. The present clinical case suggests that, in contrast to the current clinical guidelines, in case of trauma involving the jaw, mostly the Temporo-mandibular joints, a gnathological evaluation by a specialist dentist should always be considered. P36 Guided, socket shield, immediate loaded implantation, case report Lukasz Zadrozny, Leopold Wagner Medical University of Warsaw - Poland Correspondence: Lukasz Zadrozny (lukasz.zadrozny@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Proper implant positioning in the post-extraction socket is crucial for the function, durability and aesthetics of the future prosthetics. In the esthetic zone even more challenging and very difficult is to maintain the shape and structure of the tissues surrounding the tooth after its removal. Literature presents many techniques aimed at preserving tissues after tooth extraction in the best possible condition. One of them, described in 2010 by M. Hurzeller, whom proposed the retention of the buccal root segment after extraction- Socket-Shield technique. Other authors analyse it histologically and have presented many clinical cases. Furthermore, socket shield technique was classified as one of partial extraction techniques which is highly promising and may significantly influence management of the failing dentition, changing a concept from extract and augment to salvaging the patient’s own tissues where possible. Methods. This clinical report presents digitally guided approach to perform partial extraction therapy where the tooth has to be replaced by an implant immediately. A 38-year-old female patient presented fracture of clinical crown in tooth 21. Clinical examination revealed total mobility of composite crown from palatal site. Because of direction and depth of crown fracture the tooth was classified to be extracted. Digital model of patient dentition was prepared as the stl file and superimposed over dicom files from CBCT examination. Implant position and surgical guide were digitally planed in DDS-Pro software (DDS-Pro). Temporary crown was designed in Exocad (Exocad Gmbh) software and milled in PMMA. After preparing of buccal root segment the osteotomy for 4,0x11,5 implant (Hiossen TSIII NH, Osstem Implants) was performed though 3D printed sleeveless guide with OneGuide Kit (Osstem Implants). Implant was placed palatal to the shield with initial stability 35 Ncm. PMMA crown was bonded to temporary abutment and attached to an implant with torque of 20 Ncm. Results. Postopperative CBCT revealed proper implant positioning and maintaining a buccal root shield. Conclusion. The modern dental care philosophy aims to preserve dental tissue as much as possible, even when tooth extraction is required. Very important are also time of treatment and addressing aesthetic and functional expectations of the patient. Presented case required a thorough planning phase but offered a possibility of not loosing a tooth from aesthetic point of patient’s view. Considering perfect implant positioning and maintaining the best condition of hard and soft tissues, presented in this study technique, combining PET with guided implantation, could be a valuable tool to restore teeth especially in the aesthetic region.

The objective of research was to approbate integrated approach for evaluation the results of dental implant treatment using customized image analysis algorithm of CBCT scans. Methods. Primary stage of the research was dedicated to the formation of a study sample, consisted of a set of 156 CBCT data pairs (dicom-files, voxel size 100 μm, isotropic) of 78 patients who had undergone dental implantation at the University Dental Clinic. Periimplant bone changes evaluation was following originally developed algorithm which included, segmentation of the area of interest from the CBCT data set with the isolation of the implant installation region, transformation of the formatted image of region of interestI from the *.dcm format to the *.stl format, superimpose of obtained stl-files from the data sets, calculation of the absolute bone volume loss around dental implant due to the amount of non-matched image parts. Evaluation of bone parameters conducted in the adapted software ImageJ with additional plug-in BoneJ (the Wellcome Trust). Implant stability was measured with Ostell Mentor (Ostell). Statistical analysis of numerical data performed using software Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Office, 2016). Results. Method of STL-superimposition helped to calculate absolute volumetric parameter of radiused bone loss at periimplant region. Such average values for the implants installed in the distal part of maxilla were 3,547 cubed mm., around maxillary frontal implants its volume reached 3,118 cubed mm., mean bone loss around mandibular distal implants was 2,614 cubed mm., and mandibular frontal implants lost 2,456 cubed mm. of circular bone volume. Statistically tested correlation value between mean vertical bone loss and radiused volumetric bone reduction reached r=0,784 (p≤0,05). Also specific regressions between parameters of bone loss and prosthetic designs were found. In addition correlation level were estimated between ISQ values, volumetric bone loss measured by the superimposition principle and marginal bone loss measured by the sagittal slices of CBCT. Conclusions. The proposed approach ensures possibilities for objectification not only geometrical, but also qualitative changes of bone at peri-implant region and takes into account the impact of functional stability of titanium infra-structures to prognose the success of treatment. The possibility of considering customized values of volumetric peri-implant bone loss instead of simple geometrical bone height reduction value, allows to individualize treatment algorithm by adapting different prosthetic designs due to the patient rehabilitation group with different trends of bone loss. Clinics P38 CAD/CAM Monolithic Restoration in Molar Region without Occlusal Adjusment Zoltán Imre Kovács1, Judit Borbely2, Peter Schmidt2, Peter Hermann2 1Semmelweis University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of General Dental Preclinical Practice - Hungary – Budapest; 2Semmelweis University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Prosthodontics - Hungary - Budapest Correspondence: Zoltán Imre Kovács (dr.csonti@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Development of digital technology in dentistry gives the opporunity to produce CAD/CAM temporary and definitvie monolithic restorations. A usual problem with monolithic restorations is the occlusal correction after syntering procedures. During dental treatment, usually a temporary restoration is needed, which fits the preparation margin and the occlusion is adjusted in the patient mouth. If the morfology of this restoration is perfect, the need of making an absolutly alike definitve restoration appears. Laboratory design software makes it possible to use shapes recorded in prepreparation scan during the comptuter aided design. The aim of this study was to compare the adjusted occlusal contact of the temporary restoration to the monolithic definitive restoration’s, which shape is copied from the temporary in the design software. Methods. A 36 year old woman presented with the need of a treatment for her lost left mandibular first molar. The treatment plan was a 3 unit monolithic zirconia bridge. The preparation was made with 1-1,5 mm reduction and rounded shoulder finishing line. An intraoral scan was taken by Trios POD Wireless scanner. (TRIOS, 3Shape, Denmark). A 3 unit temporary PMMA bridge (Yamahachi) was designed in 3Shape Dental Designer software. After milling, the occlusion was adjusted in the mouth with the help of a T-scan device (Tekscan, U.S.). A prepreparation intaoral scan was taken from the temporary bridge, which was copied in the design software for the definitive monolithic zirconia restoration. (GLI Bruxzir shaded, Glidewell Dental, U.S). Results. The measured occlusal contacts with T-scan of the definitive restoration did not show significant difference from the temporary restorations. Conclusions. Using the recorded shape of the temporary bridge as a prepreparation scan, the production of the monolithic zirconia bridge was possible. The patient felt the zirconia bridge as comfortable as the PMMA. With this method, the occlusal correction and repolishing of the definitive restoration was not needed.

Correspondence: Justinas Pletkus (justinas.pletkus@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Survival and success rates of immediate implant loading may vary widely according to literature. Advances in digital technologies create an opportunity for fast fabrication and delivery of final restorations. There is a very limited data on clinical outcomes of immediate loading of implants with final full-contour ceramic restorations produced using completely digital workflow. The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical and prosthetic aspects of immediate implant loading with glass ceramic screw-retained single crowns that could be associated with biologic and prosthetic outcomes. Methods. Nineteen subjects, who required single tooth implant supported crown in the posterior region of the mandible received one or more implant (patients with bad or parafunctional habits were excluded). In total 22 implants were placed. Primary stability measured and recorded in Ncm and ISQ values. Cerec® (Densply Sirona) implant scan post and scanbody was attached to the implant. Omnicam® (Densply Sirona) intraoral scanner (IOS) (CEREC AC software 4.3) was used to take the digital impressions and bite registrations. Within 24hours functional glass ceramic (N!CE, Straumann) crowns were delivered (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). For every crown occlusal and interproximal contacts were adjusted and recorded. Quality of contact points were measured with shimstock occlusal foil (Hanel, Coltene). Restorations were followed-up for 1, 3, 6 months. Results. 1 implant failed and was removed after 4 weeks. The rest implants and crowns were in function with no technical or biological complications after 6 months of use (survival rate of our study was 95,5%). Statistically significant effect on MBL was not found considering factors such as implant size, time after extraction, bone type, soft tissue thickness, and primary stability measured in Ncm and ISQ values. Mean MBL mesially was 0.3mm (SD 0.42) and distally – 0.4mm (SD 0.66). These findings are similar to those in other studies reporting MBL on delayed or immediate loading. One distal and one mesial proximal contacts were missing during 6 months check-up, similarly as during insertion of the crowns - 1 and 2, accordingly. Conclusions. Fully digital workflow without 3D printed model could be successfully employed for immediate functional loading with a single-unit implant-supported crowns fabricated from glass ceramics. When patients are carefully selected, it can provide clinically acceptable biologic and prosthetic outcomes in a follow-up period of 6 months. The protocol should be further evaluated with longer observational periods.

Female patient 66 years old needed dental therapy of the upper right partial edentulism of maxilla. Old PMF fixed partial denture was loosened and the extraction of the tooth 12 was indicated. Tooth 15 was indicated for the root treatment and post. Region 14 and 13 were indicated for implant therapy. Methods. Dental status was taken. To reduce the patient x-ray exposure following ALARA recommendation only small FOV on CBCT was done. The impacted right upper canine was discovered. Patient knew about it, but it was completely asymptomatic for years and no other surrounding pathology couldn’t be seen on CBCT. Extraction of the impacted tooth was avoided because of expected massive bone loss and possible complications. The tooth 12 was extracted. There was no buccal plate after extraction, so this site was excluded for immediate implant placement. Two C-Tech implants were placed through the impacted tooth in region 13 (EL 3,5x11) and 14 (EL 3,5x9). Primary stability was achieved on 60N/cm. The wound was sutured with 4,0 Nylon. Control CBCT was taken, expected positions of implants were achieved. Patient was prescribed with antibiotic therapy Sinacillin 0.5g 3x1 for seven days and Ibuprofen 0.4 if needed. Results. No postoperative pain, swelling or bleeding was reported by the patient. After seven days sutures were removed, the wound healing was uneventful. Tooth 15 was treated and CoCrMo post was made. After four months implants were uncovered without any difficulties and healing caps were placed. Conclusions. There are only a few case reports done with placing implants into impacted teeth. From our experience protocol deviation is justified in situations when expected bone loss is compromising implant therapy afterward. There should be more studies confirming the safety of such procedures.

Ameloblastoma is a benign, locally infiltrative epithelial odontogenic tumour with cortical expansion and a high local recurrence rate. Clinically; the long standing lesions are characterized by looseness of teeth, root resorption and usually combined with unerupted tooth. Tumour cells have a great tendency to invade the surrounding healthy tissue which is considered to be the essential step in tumour progression. In the mandible majority of ameloblastomas are found in the molar ramus region. There are 7 types of ameloblastomas, follicular ameloblastoma having the highest rate of recurrence, therefore these cases are treated by surgical excision and reconstruction by iliac crest or free fibula graft. The challenge is in dental rehabilitation of such patients, aim is to rehabilitate the dentition not with removable but with dental implants restoring form and function. Methods. A 28 years old male came with complaint of pain, swelling and discharge from right retromolar region since 3 weeks’ revealed presence of a huge cystic lesion in the right ramus of mandible which had pushed the third molar superiorly. What was first thought to be a routine dentigerous cyst turned out to be a follicular ameloblastoma, confirmed by biopsy. Under general anaesthesia, the patient was operated for complete enucleation of the tumour. The Mandible was partially resected, simultaneously a free fibula graft was harvested and fixed in place with a reconstruction plate. The patient was placed on intravenous antibiotics and painkillers, after 8 days, he was discharged. Liquid diet was advised for 3 weeks post-surgery. After 10 months, the soft tissue healing was complete, CT scan showed a well-integrated graft. The cortico cancellous component was deemed to be satisfactory and dental implants placed by a flapless procedure as we did not want to disturb the mucosal attachment to the graft. 8 weeks later, they were loaded with screw retained prosthesis to prevent cement leaching through the mucosa till the fibula. Occlusion was checked with a T scan to ensure equal distribution. Results. Satisfactory dental rehabilitation was achieved by placing dental implants in the optimal stage when the cortico cancellous proportion of fibula graft was favourable for achieving primary stability. In the follow up of two years, we saw good remodelling of fibula under favourable load Conclusions. Patients with resected mandible can be given fixed prosthetic options, provided the planning and placing of dental implants is done in a calculated phased manner and the patient is counselled on the need of strict oral hygiene measures in the absence of attached gingiva. Giving such patients a removable denture or obturator works against them as food collection, non-loading, leads to resorption of graft and facial asymmetry with loss of function.

Although local anesthesia (LA) is an imperative of modern dentistry, many dental students feel insufficiently prepared for administration of their first injection in a clinical setting. Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view. Visualization and interaction are fundamental components of AR technology. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of an AR application in students administering LA for the first time. Methods. Students were categorized into two groups. In addition to the theoretical and practical training, the students of the experimental group used the AR simulator. The trigger for acute stress was LA administration. The concentration of salivary cortisol was measured before and after LA. Patients were children who had indications for anesthesia. Mann-Whitney test, t-test and Wilcoxon test were used to test statistical hypotheses. Results. The level of cortisol after anesthesia was statistically significant in all subjects, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. The time required for the LA administration was significantly longer in the control group (p = 0.014). Conclusions. Given that blood sampling is a stressful process that could add up to the anxiety level, in the study we measured the concentration of salivary cortisol. We opted for afternoon measurements when the levels of salivary cortisol are considered to be stable according to the circadian rhythm. Increased cortisol concentration in all students after LA supports the opinion of many clinicians that LA administration is one of the more stressful aspects of clinical practice. Having the syringe in the patient’s line of sight and performing lengthy treatments may result in unsatisfactory analgesia, specifically in children. Using the AR, the anatomical structures in the oral cavity are easy and convenient to use and give a good introduction to clinical anesthesia due to user interaction, as demonstrated in our study - students who received AR training had significantly less time for the anesthetic procedure. This form of learning provides an innovative and interactive way of presenting material, and therefore should be used in addition to conventional learning or as a self-improvement tool that can result in a positive response and student motivation. AR application can influence better understanding of anatomy structure and the correct and faster technique for administering local anesthesia, but cannot reduce acute stress.

The material of this poster includes a literature review and two clinical cases of perispheric facial nerve palsy from the group of cases studied and treated by the author over a period of 20 years. Patients previously evaluated and diagnosed by neurosurgery with facial paralysis or Bell's palsy. A common clinical pattern was observed in the treated patients: skeletal class II, facial asymmetry, temporo-mandibular dysfunction and cranio-cervical dysfunction. A standard test was performed at the first consultation, which included a detailed description of the degree and location of the tests. of paresis, taste, extra-oral clinical examination and intra-oral clinical examination, electromyographic examination, MRI and audio-spectrometric analysis of temporomandibular joints. The immediate suspension of any type of medication indicated previously for the treatment of the pathology is ordered. OrthokineticTM splints of Neuro Muscular and Skull-cervical Articular Repositioning Splints (Patent No. 978627) are adapted and controlled with T-Scan Analysis and follow-up once every two days, second control at week and third at two weeks and then once a month. Complementary phisical therapy was used. Results. The clinical examination revealed 100% unilateral complete paralysis. The follow-up showed in 100% of the patients the function was partially restored on the second day and total at 6 days. In 100% of the patients the function of the normal mimicry was obtained.The sequels of dysfunction were 0% for the total of the patients Conclusions. Cranio-masticatory dysfunction could have an influence on skeletal mechanics and neuro-muscular mechanics in the anatomical course of the facial nerve, which could lead to its dysfunction, with the consequent paralysis of the muscles of the affected side.The use of prednisone poses a great ethical problem because there is no evidence of its efficacy and the euphoric side effect induces a false sense of benefit in patients.Dental occlusion is directly and intimately related with the temporo-mandibular and cranio-cervical balance. Occlusal imbalances could influence neuro-muscular imbalance, temporo-mandibular imbalance and cranio-cervical imbalance, which would affect the normal function of any cranial nerve involved, including the facial nerve or VII cranial nerve. P44 Guided implant placement in patient with Multiple Idiopathic Cervical Resorption Lukasz Zadrozny, Katarzyna Brus-Sawczuk Medical University of Warsaw - Poland Correspondence: Lukasz Zadrozny (lukasz.zadrozny@gmail.com) Abstract Background. Multiple Idiopathic Cervical Resorption is very a rare disease and proceed asimptiomatic until teeth mobility occurs or accidental X-ray reveales different degree of cervical resorption in more than one tooth. Infected teeth stays vital with proper pulp reactions. MICR may run and develop in different time on another teeth even if previously founded illness teeth were treated or extracted. Potential reasons for this disease developent are trauma or injury or systemic diseases such as hyperparathyroidism. Methods. A 41-year-old female patient with good general health complained on increased mobility of front teeth in the mandible. Clinically teeth 32-42 has 3rd grate of mobility. Patient had a face trauma about 30 years ago. OPG X-Ray revealed severe cervical resorption in teeth 33-43 and 15-11, 21 has RCT done many years ago. CBCT was taken for more accurate diagnostics and additional blood test were done. Mandible treatment plan based on virtual planning with CBCTs DICOM data and an optical scans STLs files of both dental arches (DentiqGuide) and preparing temporary bridge (Exocad) obtains extracting of teeth 33-43 and guided immediate implants placement in positions 33, 31, 43 and immediate loading. In local anesthesia teeth 33-43 were sectioned and extracted. Sleeveless 3D printed guide with OneGuide Kit (Osstem Implant) were used to place implants in positions corresponding with virtual planning to be restore immediate by already milled from PMMA six units temporary bridge. ISQ values for each implant was over 75 what provides condition for immediate loading. Bridge was positioned in occlusion with positioning splint and bonding to abutments. After unscrewing, bridge was polished and screwed back, access holes were closed with composite. Results. Teeth supported 3D printed guide provides 3 implants placement with accuracy allowing for fixing and screw retaining of six points unit bridge, in proper occlusion. Conclusion. Virtual, backward planning of complex cases may offer possibilities for an esthetic restoration of implant supported fixed prosthesis. In the presented case of MICR, treatment plan includes potential development of resorption on remaining teeth. Basing on that fact long time temporary reconstruction was attached to the implants through multiunits. Implants positioned in sites 33, 31 and 43 and multiunit abutments creates open condition to exchange bridge to more expand if potential further extractions would be required and offers even full arch reconstruction with only two additional implants in premolar or molar sites if the initial disease would still develop.

Frontal mandible is common described as a safe zone for implant procedures. Besides of inferior alveolar nerves and vessels injuries much more dangerous may be hurting of sublingual artery or its branches what can happen if implant drill perforate lingual plate of mandible. Hurting these arteries may provoke severe bleeding to the sublingual space and creation of sublingual hematoma and subsequently obstruct the airways, what can be potentially mortal. Methods. A 62-year-old female patient presented with hoopless teeth 33-41 in anterior mandible and toothless maxila. Teeth extractions were planed and because of big discrepancy in bone height of front and back segments of mandible, bone reduction in front segment was planned. Two implants with Locator attachments in positions of canines were planned to support future removable prosthesis. Two- pieces bone supported surgical guide was designed and 3D printed. First- lower part fixed to the bone with two anchor screws determines range of planned bone reduction. Second- upper part of guide with attachments to the first and another bone anchor pin provides implants positioning with sleeveless OneGuide Kit (Osstem Implants). After flap opening, teeth were extracted and first part of guide were set on the bone and stabilize with two anchor screws. Bone was reduced according to the guide. Second guide part was then attached to the already fixed part and additionally fixed with third anchor. Osteotomy for implant in position 33 was performed. During preparation of osteotomy in position 43 high bone density was felt. Probing revealed lingual plate bone perforation at the end of osteotomy. No severe bleeding occurred and no distortion of lingual soft tissue were found. Osteotomy was filled with hemostatic sponge (Ferrosan) and medially another osteotomy was prepared freehand. Implants were placed and wound was closed. Results. Check up examinations and communication with patient didn’t revealed any signs of increasing bleeding and development of intraoperative complication. Conclusion. Guided surgeries provide new possibilities and improve accuracy of implant procedures. Very important is to not forget about still existing range of inaccuracy especially when tissue or bone supported guides are used. Clinician has to consider that drills for guided surgeries are about 10mm longer than standard and the longer the drill the farer its tip may deflect even with minor guide setting inaccuracy. That may leads to destroy anatomical structures, and it’s extremely important to calculate safety zones even in guided surgeries.

abstract={Oral presentations O1 How population data informs the science of foot disorders and health Marian Hannan Marcus Institute for Aging Research, Hebrew SeniorLife and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA This presentation will provide an epidemiological overview of the current population levels of foot pathologies, including current challenges and viewpoints. This session will also addressed the need for a data-driven approach as we consider common etiologies and causal pathways, for example, the links between obesity and pedal pathologies as well as special considerations regarding clinical trial designs for the foot and ankle research. The past decade has brought many new insights to the epidemiology of foot and ankle disorders as well as insights into early pathology, and even possible prevention of impaired foot structure and function. Clinical cases and laboratory studies have provided information on treatment and insights into mechanisms. Yet, we still know relatively little of the population impact and informed prevention that may help people NOT become patients. The objective of this presentation is to provide a population-based understanding of foot type, pathologies and function in the population from major studies in the United States. We will consider how populations inform science and medicine, how to obtain complex measurements from large groups outside the laboratory, and highlight major findings of population-based foot studies. A better understanding of these issues can help to inform the public as well as disseminate clinical and scientific information. How do all of these data sources inform our understanding of foot biomechanics and translation of research? Epidemiology may serve as a bridge between our current knowledge base and how to grow this foundation to the next level of insights and interventions in the 21st century. Such a focus will encourage the integration of our knowledge of biomechanics and movement with “Big Data” collections, taking our field to the next level. O2 The value of population data on foot problems: perspectives from Australia and the United Kingdom Hylton Menz2,1 1La Trobe Sport and Exercise Medicine Research Centre, La Trobe University , Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 2School of Allied Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia Epidemiology can be defined as the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and the factors that may influence patterns of disease distribution in the community. By understanding the prevalence and risk factors for a particular disease, its burden can be quantified, and targets for treatment and prevention can be identified. Epidemiology is therefore a cornerstone of public health and provides valuable information for shaping health policy. Although it has long been recognised that foot problems are highly prevalent, disabling and costly, foot problems have historically been ignored in population-based epidemiology studies. This lack of epidemiological data has prevented the podiatry profession from being able to demonstrate its value in relation to public health and has made it difficult for researchers to attract research funding. Fortunately, this has changed in recent years, with the initiation of several well-designed population-based studies incorporating detailed information on foot problems. This presentation will provide an overview of five population-based studies that the presenter has had the privilege of being involved in over the past decade: (i) the North West Adelaide Health Study, (ii) the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women’s Health, (iii) the Geelong Osteoporosis Study, (iv) the Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort Study and (v) the Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot. Strengths and limitations of each of these studies will be discussed, along with a summary of their key findings. Finally, the presentation will discuss the recent establishment of a foot and ankle consortium to enhance research capacity and facilitate international collaboration using these resources. O3 Global update on physical activity – are we making progress in Australia and internationally? Adrian Bauman University of Sydney, Sydney University, NSW, Australia Physical inactivity is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, both in high income earned in low middle income countries. Despite the advocacy efforts of NGOs, professional societies, and the Lancet series on physical activity in 2012 and 2016, much remains to be done to increase population levels of activity. This talk will review the policy framework and efforts to promote physical activity in Australia and internationally over the past three decades. Despite having many physical activity researchers, and having a national NCD plan, Australia has no physical activity plan or strategy to promote physical activity or reduced sitting time. Since 1989, rates of physical activity amongst Australian adults have remained unchanged or declined slightly, especially with respect to moderate to vigorous forms of structured physical activity and exercise. Rates of inactivity are also high amongst adolescents and children. The one area which may show some improvement is in population levels of walking, which is an accessible and feasible activity for almost all adults of all ages. Globally, there are also many challenges to resourcing physical activity strategies at the population level. These challenges posed an urgent public health crisis. O4 Athlete data and relevance for public health and physical activity across the lifespan Michael K Drew1,2,3 1Athlete Availability Program, Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra, ACT, Australia; 2Australian Centre for Research into Injury in Sport and its Prevention, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 3Research Institute for Sport and Exercise , University of Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia Olympic athletes provide an opportunity to understand the nth degree of human potential. One of these potentials is the ability to withstand high workloads – both physical and mental. This lecture will outline the current activities undertaken by the Athlete Availability Program at the Australian Institute of Sport and detail the requirements to keep athletes healthy. A key focus of the talk will be how learnings can be translated to ‘everyday athletes’ and emerging areas that all clinicians should be aware of when managing injuries in active populations whether they are recreational or Olympians. O5 Training athletes to optimise performance Jon Buckley Alliance for Research in Exercise, Nutrition and Activity (ARENA), University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia Athletes undergo training to induce adaptations that can improve performance. Too little training can result in suboptimal performance but, conversely, too much training with inadequate recovery can also lead to adverse performance effects. In order to optimise athletic performance training programs must achieve the correct balance between training load and recovery. Technological advances have allowed for training loads to be quantified quite readily, but quantification of the load being performed does not provide any insight into how an athlete is responding to that load. A large number of biomarkers have been evaluated to determine how athletes are responding to different training loads, but currently there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any given biomarker. Our team has been evaluating various parameters that can be assessed during submaximal exercise that correlate with changes in athletic performance following changes in training load. These parameters include heart rate acceleration during the transition from rest to exercise, and changes in movement and gait patterns. This presentation will provide insights into these novel methods for assessing how an athlete is responding to training, and how they can be used to inform changes in athletic training programs to optimise performance. O6 Efficacy of heel lifts in the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy: a randomised trial Chantel L Rabusin1, Hylton B Menz1, Jodie A McClelland1, Angela M Evans1, Karl B Landorf1, Peter Malliaris2, Sean I Docking1, Shannon E Munteanu1 1La Trobe Sport and Exercise Medicine, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; 2Department of Physiotherapy, Monash University, Frankston, Victoria, Australia Correspondence: Chantel L Rabusin Background Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common overuse musculoskeletal condition causing pain and disability. There are two commonly used conservative interventions. Calf muscle eccentric exercise has been found to be effective in decreasing pain and improving function in people with AT. Heel lifts reduce ankle joint dorsiflexion and Achilles tendon strain, however the efficacy of this intervention for AT has not been determined. The aim of this trial, therefore, was to compare the efficacy of heel lifts against calf muscle eccentric exercise for reducing pain and improving function in AT. Methods One hundred participants aged between 22 to 66 years (45.9 ± 9.4) with AT were randomised to receive either Clearly Adjustable® 12 mm heel lifts (n = 50) or a calf muscle eccentric exercise program (n = 50). Outcome measures were obtained at baseline, 2, 6 and 12 weeks, the primary end-point. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A). Secondary outcome measures included thickness and integrity of the Achilles tendon, global impression of change (pain and function), severity of pain (100 mm visual analogue scale) and calf muscle function (calf rise test). Data was analysed using the intention to treat principle. VISA-A and global impression of change in symptoms at 12 weeks are presented below. Results Both groups improved in pain and function. After 12 weeks, there was no significant difference in VISA-A scores between the two groups (adjusted mean difference at week 12 = 4.5 points, 95% CI -3.0 to 12.1, p=0.232). However, statistically significant differences between groups were found for patient global impression of change in symptoms in favour of heel lifts at 12 weeks (pain: RR 1.41, CI 1.02 to 1.95; function RR 1.55, CI 1.04 to 2.31). Discussion and clinical relevance There is no difference in efficacy between heel lifts and calf muscle eccentric exercise for AT. Heel lifts can be considered a simpler and alternative intervention to calf muscle eccentric exercise for AT. O7 Profiling footwear use, training habits, running related injuries, and injury management behaviours in recreational runners in the Australian community Benjamin J Peterson1, Martin J Spink1, Fiona E Hawke1, Vivienne H Chuter1, Robin Callister2 1School of health sciences, The University of Newcastle, Ourimbah, NSW, Australia; 2School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia Correspondence: Benjamin J Peterson Background Running-related injuries (RRI) have become more prevalent as recreational running has gained popularity. The aetiology of RRI is considered to be multifactorial, and related to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This study describes the demographics, training habits, footwear selection, and injury patterns in recreational runners in the Australian community. Methods Recreational runners were recruited through community running events in New South Wales and completed self-report surveys, regarding footwear use, training habits, previous injuries, and demographic data. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and regression analyses were performed. Results Ninety-five runners (56 females) were recruited. Mean age was 47.2 + 13.0 years, weight 75.4 + 19.0 kg and height 169.3 + 9.2cm. Runners completed 2.87 + 1.39 weekly running sessions, covering 19.48 + 17.0 km per week, most commonly on concrete (58.9%; n=56) and bitumen (51.5%; n=49). Footwear was prescribed by a podiatrist or footwear retailer for 20% (n=19) of runners, with 57.9% (n=55) using a neutral shoe and 25.3% (n=24) using motion-controlling footwear. Asics was the most commonly worn footwear brand (24.2%; n=23) and Asics Kayano the most commonly worn shoe overall (10.5%; n=10). The average age of current running shoes was 11.33 + 10.1 months. Increased weekly mileage was associated with a lower shoe age (r=0.324, p=0.002). The rate of RRI within three months prior to recruitment was 50% (n=49). The most common injury sites were the ankles (20%; n=13), feet (16.9%; n=11), and knees (15.4%; n=10). Foot orthoses were worn by 20% (n=19) of runners and use was associated with previous injury (r=0.242, p=0.019). One third (n=15) of runners who sustained a RRI reported seeing a health professional, most commonly podiatrists (n=4) and physiotherapists (n=4). Those who saw a health professional were more likely to wear foot orthoses (r=0.441, p=0.002), and to have less time-loss from running, however this did not reach statistical significance (r=-0.272, p=0.061). Discussion and Clinical Relevance Injuries are common among Australian recreational runners. Injured runners frequently seek the advice of health professionals, and this behaviour may result in less time-loss due to injury, however further research with larger sample sizes is required to confirm this. O8 A systematic review into the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for detecting Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction Stephanie Lubcke, Ryan S Causby, Ian Fulton, Sandy Maranna, Steve Milanese School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia Correspondence: Ryan S Causby Background Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction (PTTD) is a progressive foot condition caused by overuse or degeneration of the Posterior Tibial Tendon. The condition is seen in orthopaedic, podiatry and physiotherapy clinics. Diagnosis is attained primarily through clinical tests and occasionally confirmed with MRI or ultrasound. However, the evidence supporting the clinical tests is not clear. Thus, to determine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for detecting PTTD in people with medial foot pain and associated symptoms we undertook a systematic review. Methods Searches of AMED, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed and Scopus were conducted. Two independent reviewers were involved in study selection and quality appraisal using Covidence and the QUADAS-2 tool, respectively. Results The initial database search yielded 813 articles. After title and abstract screening and duplicate removal, 47 studies remained. From these, 42 studies were excluded based on set criteria such as study population, study design, having a suitable index test and language; leaving five studies which had investigated the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for PTTD. These studies comprised nine clinical tests, including: Unipedal standing balance test, Posterior Tibial Edema Sign, First Metatarsal Rise Sign, Single Leg Heel Raise (SLHR), Double Heel Raise, ‘Too many toes sign’ and Passive and Active muscle testing. The most common being the SLHR. Of the included studies, MRI was the reference standard in three studies, surgical exploration in one study and a control group was used in one study instead of a reference standard. Ultrasound was also utilised in two studies as an additional comparison reference standard. However, all studies reviewed were at risk of bias and had concerns regarding their applicability. Discussion and Clinical Relevance This review finds that there is limited evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for PTTD. A discussion of the findings of the review and the identified clinical tests will be provided, with the aim of providing clinicians with the evidence underpinning tests commonly used in podiatry practice. Future research should be conducted into this area with a focus on high quality, well-powered studies investigating different clinical tests compared to a gold standard. O9 A cross-sectional study comparing clinical and psychosocial features in tibialis posterior tendinopathy with controls: preliminary findings Megan H Ross, Michelle D Smith, Bill Vicenzino The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia Correspondence: Megan H Ross Background Tibialis posterior tendinopathy is associated with pain during activities that load the tibialis posterior tendon and limited participation in daily and physical activities. Little is known about factors such as quality of life and psychosocial features in tibialis posterior tendinopathy. The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate clinical and psychosocial characteristics of individuals with tibialis posterior tendinopathy. Methods We compared individuals with tibialis posterior tendinopathy (currently n = 19, age: 42±14; BMI: 27±8) and asymptomatic controls (n = 26, age: 43±17, BMI: 23±5). Diagnosis was made clinically based on medial foot/ankle pain plus one or more of: tenderness on palpation or swelling of the tibialis posterior tendon or pain/difficulty with resisted plantarflexion inversion or single leg heel raise. Clinical measures of foot posture, function, range of motion, strength at the foot and hip, and self-reported psychosocial measures were assessed. Preliminary between group differences were explored using independent t-tests. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to evaluate effect sizes. Interpretation of SMDs was as follows: 1.2 large. Results Preliminary analyses suggest large effects (SMD > 1.2) for more pain, poorer self-reported function and quality of life, in addition to more pronated foot posture, poorer single leg heel raise endurance and greater time to complete stair descent/ascent in tibialis posterior tendinopathy compared to controls (p1.2 large. Results Preliminary analyses suggest large effects (SMD > 1.2) for more pain, poorer self-reported function and quality of life, in addition to more pronated foot posture, poorer single leg heel raise endurance and greater time to complete stair descent/ascent in tibialis posterior tendinopathy compared to controls (p45 years with symptomatic radiographic first MTP joint OA were recruited from the community using advertisements and our existing networks. Participants in the intervention arm had 3-5 visits with a podiatrist and received prefabricated foot orthoses (>6hrs wear/day), home exercise and manual therapy (twice/day), and advice concerning footwear, weight loss, physical activity, and analgesia. Participants in the usual care arm had 1-2 visits with a GP and received medication advice/prescription, and the same advice as the intervention group. Primary outcomes were measures of feasibility assessed at 3-months (recruitment/retention rates, exercise sessions/week on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), and orthoses wear hours/day). Secondary outcomes included walking pain (11-point NRS), function (foot health status questionnaire; FHSQ), global rating of change (7-point Likert Scale), adherence (11-point NRS), and adverse events. Results Thirty people from 236 screened (12.7%) were included. All except one attended the required clinical visits, and 26 completed final outcomes (14 in podiatry group, 12 in GP group). In the podiatry group, adherence was good with exercise (mean 9.3 sessions/week, 7.1/10 on NRS) and orthoses wear (6.2 hours/day, 7.0/10 on NRS). Adherence to medication use in the GP group was lower (5.3/10 on NRS). There were three reported minor adverse events in the podiatry group that all resolved. Both groups reported improved pain (mean change in podiatry group: -2.2/10, GP group: -2.8/10 on NRS) and function (podiatry: 18.3/100, GP: 13.6/100 on FHSQ) above minimum clinically important differences. Seven people (50%) in the podiatry group and 4 (33%) in the GP group rated themselves as “moderately better” or “much better”. Conclusion A clinical trial comparing a multi-faceted podiatry intervention to usual GP care for people with first MTP joint OA is feasible and safe, and both treatments improve symptoms. Results will be used to help power a larger clinical trial. O21 Structural characteristics associated with radiographical severity of 1st metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis Andrew K Buldt1,2, Shannon E Munteanu1,2, Hylton B Menz1,2 1Discipline of Podiatry, School of Allied Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia; 2La Trobe Sport and Exercise Medicine Research Centre, School of Allied Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia Correspondence: Andrew K Buldt Background Osteoarthritis (OA) of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) is a common and disabling condition. The aims of this study were to determine if differences exist in the foot structure of people with and without radiographically defined 1st MTPJ OA, and whether structural differences are associated with radiographic severity of 1st MTPJ OA. Methods Weight-bearing dorso-plantar and lateral radiographs were obtained for the symptomatic foot of 137 participants (60 men, 77 women, aged 22 to 85, mean 58.1 +/- 11.4 years) with clinically diagnosed 1st MTPJ OA. Radiographic 1st MTPJ OA cases were identified and participants were graded into four severity categories using a validated atlas. The following radiographic measurements were performed: hallux abductus angle, hallux abductus interphalangeus angle, intermetatarsal angle, metatarsal protrusion distance, metatarsus adductus angle, first metatarsal declination angle, lateral intermetatarsal angle, calcaneal inclination angle, 1st metatarsal length and width, hallux proximal phalanx length and width and hallux distal phalanx length. Structural differences were compared using univariate general linear models, adjusting for age, sex and body mass index. Results One hundred and four participants were categorised as having radiographic 1st MTPJ OA. The OA case group displayed a greater hallux abductus interphalageus angle compared to the no OA case group. Participants were further categorised into no OA (n=6), mild OA (n=27), moderate OA (n=49) or severe OA (n=55) categories. Participants of the mild, moderate and severe OA categories displayed a longer 1st metatarsal compared to the no OA category. The moderate and severe OA categories displayed a greater hallux interphalangeus angle compared to the mild category OA. Discussion and clinical relevance Overall, there were few structural differences between OA cases and non-OA cases and between OA severity categories, although there was some evidence to suggest greater 1st metatarsal length in more severe cases of 1st MTPJ OA. The greater abduction of the hallux distal phalanx in OA cases and greater severity OA categories suggest a structural adaptation secondary to biomechanical factors. Further research is required to determine whether measures of dynamic foot function are associated with the presence and/or severity of 1st MTPJ OA.

O25 The child in the modern environment Jennifer Couper Womens and Childrens Hospital, Adelaide, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, Australia Over the last 30 years non-communicable disorders have been on the rise in children: overweight/obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, allergy and neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Potential common drivers from pregnancy and early life in the environment will be presented, using type 1 diabetes as the prototype to illustrate the effect of the modern environment on the at-risk child. O26 Exploring health professionals understanding of evidence and use of different treatment strategies to manage idiopathic toe walking Cylie Williams1, Kelly Gray2, Nina Davies3, Marybeth Barkocy4, Michael Fahey5, Jane Simmonds6, Pasquale Accardo7, Deborah Eastwood8, Verity Pacey2 1Monash University, Frankston, VIC, Australia; 2Macquarie University, Macquarie Park; 3Staffordshire University, Stoke on Trent; 4University of New Mexico, Albuquerque; 5Monash Children's Hospital, Clayton; 6Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London; 7Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond; 8Great Ormond St Hospital and University College, London Correspondence: Cylie Williams Background Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is an exclusionary diagnosis1 and varies in severity, from those children with full range of ankle motion2, to those with associated ankle equinus2. Many clinicians are faced with challenges in understanding available evidence-based treatment options in the absence of an evidence based treatment pathway. The primary aim of this research was to understand the agreement between health professionals’ knowledge of evidence for common treatment strategies for ITW and if the health professional's support these strategies being used in clinical practice. Methods: This was an international cross-sectional online survey between July 2017 and March 2018. This survey was open to registered health professionals who treat children with ITW. This survey was advertised through professional associations, social media and special interest groups. The survey had two components: 1) General demographic variables and variables relating to knowledge of evidence about ITW treatments and 2) Their support for common treatment strategies. Additional data on treatments, referrals, and preference were collected. The Kappa statistic was used to describe the intra-rater agreement between evidence knowledge and support. Regression analyses were used to understand strategy use preference of the 10 most commonly preferred treatments. Results: There were 908 international survey responses primarily from medical doctors (n=24), orthotists (n=80), physiotherapists (n=589) and podiatrists (n=149). Kappa agreement for paired correct responses determined a fair agreement for evidence support knowledge for four strategies including Watch and Wait (Kappa=0.24), Stretching (Kappa=0.30), Sensory Integration Strategies (Kappa=0.40) and Motor Control Strategies (Kappa =0.24) and moderate agreement for thirteen others. No strategies had greater than moderate agreement between knowledge of evidence and the support for the strategy being used. Profession, country of practice, average number of children treated per week, and not correctly identifying the evidence factored into many of the most commonly used strategies for ITW (p45 years with symptomatic radiographic first MTP joint OA were recruited from the community using advertisements and our existing networks. Participants in the intervention arm had 3-5 visits with a podiatrist and received prefabricated foot orthoses (>6hrs wear/day), home exercise and manual therapy (twice/day), and advice concerning footwear, weight loss, physical activity, and analgesia. Participants in the usual care arm had 1-2 visits with a GP and received medication advice/prescription, and the same advice as the intervention group. Primary outcomes were measures of feasibility assessed at 3-months (recruitment/retention rates, exercise sessions/week on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), and orthoses wear hours/day). Secondary outcomes included walking pain (11-point NRS), function (foot health status questionnaire; FHSQ), global rating of change (7-point Likert Scale), adherence (11-point NRS), and adverse events. Results Thirty people from 236 screened (12.7%) were included. All except one attended the required clinical visits, and 26 completed final outcomes (14 in podiatry group, 12 in GP group). In the podiatry group, adherence was good with exercise (mean 9.3 sessions/week, 7.1/10 on NRS) and orthoses wear (6.2 hours/day, 7.0/10 on NRS). Adherence to medication use in the GP group was lower (5.3/10 on NRS). There were three reported minor adverse events in the podiatry group that all resolved. Both groups reported improved pain (mean change in podiatry group: -2.2/10, GP group: -2.8/10 on NRS) and function (podiatry: 18.3/100, GP: 13.6/100 on FHSQ) above minimum clinically important differences. Seven people (50%) in the podiatry group and 4 (33%) in the GP group rated themselves as “moderately better” or “much better”. Conclusion A clinical trial comparing a multi-faceted podiatry intervention to usual GP care for people with first MTP joint OA is feasible and safe, and both treatments improve symptoms. Results will be used to help power a larger clinical trial. O21 Structural characteristics associated with radiographical severity of 1st metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis Andrew K Buldt1,2, Shannon E Munteanu1,2, Hylton B Menz1,2 1Discipline of Podiatry, School of Allied Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia; 2La Trobe Sport and Exercise Medicine Research Centre, School of Allied Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia Correspondence: Andrew K Buldt Background Osteoarthritis (OA) of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) is a common and disabling condition. The aims of this study were to determine if differences exist in the foot structure of people with and without radiographically defined 1st MTPJ OA, and whether structural differences are associated with radiographic severity of 1st MTPJ OA. Methods Weight-bearing dorso-plantar and lateral radiographs were obtained for the symptomatic foot of 137 participants (60 men, 77 women, aged 22 to 85, mean 58.1 +/- 11.4 years) with clinically diagnosed 1st MTPJ OA. Radiographic 1st MTPJ OA cases were identified and participants were graded into four severity categories using a validated atlas. The following radiographic measurements were performed: hallux abductus angle, hallux abductus interphalangeus angle, intermetatarsal angle, metatarsal protrusion distance, metatarsus adductus angle, first metatarsal declination angle, lateral intermetatarsal angle, calcaneal inclination angle, 1st metatarsal length and width, hallux proximal phalanx length and width and hallux distal phalanx length. Structural differences were compared using univariate general linear models, adjusting for age, sex and body mass index. Results One hundred and four participants were categorised as having radiographic 1st MTPJ OA. The OA case group displayed a greater hallux abductus interphalageus angle compared to the no OA case group. Participants were further categorised into no OA (n=6), mild OA (n=27), moderate OA (n=49) or severe OA (n=55) categories. Participants of the mild, moderate and severe OA categories displayed a longer 1st metatarsal compared to the no OA category. The moderate and severe OA categories displayed a greater hallux interphalangeus angle compared to the mild category OA. Discussion and clinical relevance Overall, there were few structural differences between OA cases and non-OA cases and between OA severity categories, although there was some evidence to suggest greater 1st metatarsal length in more severe cases of 1st MTPJ OA. The greater abduction of the hallux distal phalanx in OA cases and greater severity OA categories suggest a structural adaptation secondary to biomechanical factors. Further research is required to determine whether measures of dynamic foot function are associated with the presence and/or severity of 1st MTPJ OA.

The objective of this two-year follow-up analysis was to explore incident diabetes-related foot morbidity and mortality in people residing in Northern Tasmania. Methods Adults with diabetes were recruited from predominately community-based, publicly-funded podiatric services in regional Tasmania. The primary variable of interest was the incidence of foot ulceration, lower limb amputation and death. Other variables of interest were age, sex, rurality, socio-economic disadvantage, diabetes type and duration, knowledge of diabetes and smoking status. The main outcome was incidence of foot morbidity (foot ulceration, lower limb amputation or death) per 100 person-years. A survival analysis was conducted to determine median time to each morbidity outcome. Results There were 445 Tasmanian patients (264 males and 181 females) who completed baseline assessments. Mean age at baseline was 65 (SD 12.9, range 19-97). Sixty-two (13.9%) participants had type I diabetes and 383 (86.1%) had type II. Three hundred and fifty-three (79.3%) participants had at least one follow-up visit, with 285 (64.0%) participants still being followed-up at 12 months, 248 (55.7%) at 18 months and 203 (45.6%) at 24 months. Median number of follow-up visits = 10 (IQR 4, 22, range 1, 98). There were 57 deaths (12.8%). There were 157 (35.3%) new ulcers during the study period and 24 (5.4%) new amputations. Risk factors for worsening foot morbidity over time and the results of the survival analysis will also be presented. Conclusions Public podiatric services in regional Tasmania are managing patients at significant risk of serious diabetes-related foot morbidity. The two-year incidence of ulceration and amputation is high, and the proportion of participants who died after two years is an important finding in the Australian context. Patients presenting to these regional public podiatry services require multi-disciplinary health care in accordance with national and international guidelines. There is a potential disparity between current funding models for these services and the level of diabetes-related foot morbidity the services are managing. O31 Looking on the bright side of a diabetes diagnosis Anna Horn, Luke Donnan, Emma Baker, Caroline Robinson Charles Sturt University, Thurgoona, NEW SOUTH WALES, Australia Correspondence: Anna Horn Background One in four adults over the age of 25 years are living with diabetes or what is known as pre-diabetes, and in 2016 diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in Australia. It is therefore, no surprise that publically accessible diabetes resources commonly highlight the potential negatives associated with a diagnosis of diabetes, such as neurological and vascular complications, amputation, and higher rates of depression. What is less commonly highlighted is that half of people diagnosed with diabetes report coping well, and 72% are rarely restricted in their daily activities. Methods Random sampling was used to recruit 50 participants (31 female; 19 male; 71.78±9.64 years) to a foot health promotion event at the Charles Sturt University Community Engagement and Wellness Centre. Student practitioners completed basic neurovascular assessments to ascertain each participant’s arterial, venous and neurological status. Participants also completed the Foot Health Status Questionnaire. With the exception of age, absolute toe pressure and monofilament results, data was categorical in nature. Pearson’s Chi-square was used to identify significant relationships between variables. Results Thirteen percent of participants reported they were currently managing diabetes. This is below the 16.6% expected for Australians in the 65-74 years age range, however, the sample was a random representation of the local over-55 population. Of those reporting medical treatment for diabetes, significant findings suggest the feet of participants did not restrict work activities (p=0.01), climbing stairs (p=0.04), or the ability to shower and dress themselves (p=0.04). Significant interactions with a diagnosis of diabetes were also noted for an excellent self-rating of health (p<0.00) and energy level (p=0.04). Discussion The findings of this study indicate that the majority of older people living with diabetes are feeling healthy and are not restricted by their diagnosis. It is known that positive messaging in public health campaigns is more effective in changing behaviour than reinforcing negative information. Despite the need to educate clients about the risks associated with poorly controlled diabetes, clinicians also have a key role in highlighting the benefits of positive behavioural change and improving health literacy to enhance the health and wellbeing of clients. O32 Calf muscle stretching is ineffective in increasing ankle range of motion or reducing plantar pressures in people with diabetes and ankle equinus: a randomised controlled trial Martin J Spink1, Angela Searle1, Christopher Oldmeadow2, Simon Chiu2, Vivienne H Chuter1 1University of Newcastle, Ourimbah, NSW, Australia; 2Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia Correspondence: Martin J Spink Background Elevated plantar pressures have been implicated in the development and non-healing of foot ulcer in people with diabetes. Limited ankle dorsiflexion, or equinus, has been associated with elevated plantar pressures. This trial investigated if a stretching intervention could increase ankle dorsiflexion and reduce plantar pressures in people with diabetes. Methods Two-arm parallel randomised controlled trial at an Australian university podiatry clinic. Adults with diabetes and ankle equinus (≤ 5 degrees dorsiflexion) were randomly allocated to receive an eight-week calf stretching intervention (n=34) or continue with their normal activities for eight weeks (n=34). Primary outcomes were weight bearing and non-weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and forefoot peak plantar pressures. Secondary outcome measures were forefoot pressure time integrals and adherence to the stretching intervention. Differences between groups were analysed with analysis of covariance. Results 68 adults (mean (SD) age and diabetes duration 67.4 (10.9) years and 14.0 (10.8) years, 64.7% male) were recruited. Following the intervention, no significant differences were found between groups for ankle dorsiflexion either non-weight bearing (adjusted mean difference +1.3 degrees, 95% CI:-0.3 to 2.9, p=0.101) or weight bearing (adjusted mean difference +0.5 degrees, 95% CI:-2.6 to 3.6, p=0.743). No differences were found for forefoot in-shoe (adjusted mean difference 1.5kPa, 95% CI -10.0 to 12.9, p=0.803) or barefoot peak pressures (adjusted mean difference -19.1kPa, 95% CI:-96.4 to 58.1, p=0.628). Additionally no significant reductions in forefoot pressure time integrals were identified. Seven (20.6%) of the intervention group and 2 (5.9%) of the control group were lost to follow up. Discussion and Clinical Relevance Our data failed to show a statistically or clinically significant meaningful effect of calf muscle stretching on ankle range of motion, or plantar pressures, in people with diabetes and ankle equinus. Diabetes related changes to muscle-tendon or neural structures may make stretching less effective in this group. While current guidelines, including those from the American Diabetes Association, recommend stretching to maintain joint range of motion in people with diabetes, it is not effective as a stand-alone therapy to increase ankle joint range of motion in this population. O33 Diabetes education retention: A Systematic Review Julia Yuncken, Cylie Williams, Terry Haines Monash Univeristy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia Correspondence: Julia Yuncken Background Diabetes education remains crucial for the treatment and prevention of diabetes complications. There is limited knowledge of long-term information retention or what are resultant behaviour changes due to diabetes education. There is also limited guidance for the most effective education methods to affect behaviour change. This systematic review evaluated the findings of the literary body on the impact that education practices have on behaviour change, knowledge or participant satisfaction. Methods Databases Medline, CINHAL, Science Direct, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane were searched for articles investigating behaviour change, knowledge, or participant satisfaction in connection with diabetes education. The two reviewers screened articles independently against inclusion criteria and educational methods, and outcomes and timeframes were extracted from qualifying papers. Data were synthesized against Kirkpatrick’s Hierarchy of Learning. Discussion and clinical relevance In total, 849 studies were found using primary search criteria, of those all but 39 studies were disqualified using inclusion criteria. Of the 39 qualifying studies, 18 were randomised trials, nine were cross sectional studies and the remaining studies included quasi-experimental, observational and repeated measures design studies. Method of education included verbal, written and visual modes, delivered by both multi-disciplinary teams and single health care practitioners. Topics of education included general diabetes complications, foot complications, diet, physical activity and self-foot care. Outcomes reviewed included diabetes knowledge, foot care knowledge and HbA1C levels post education. Conclusion Diabetes education is ubiquitous in diabetes treatment however it remains unclear if patients retain the educational information provided or if the information retained causes behavioural change which in turn results in a decrease to complications. O34 Affective and cognitive factors associated with pain and function in people with plantar heel pain Matthew P Cotchett1, Karl B Landorf1, Shannon E Munteanu1, Daniel Bonanno1, Glen Whittaker1, Angus Lennecke1, Virginia Medica2 1Discipline of Podiatry, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia; 2Podiatry Department, The Northern Hospital, Epping, VIC, Australia Correspondence: Matthew P Cotchett Background It is widely accepted that psychological variables, including affective, cognitive and behavioural factors, are associated with self-reported pain and self-reported physical function in patients with musculoskeletal pain. However, the relationship between psychological variables and foot pain and foot function, in people with plantar heel pain (PHP), has received less attention. Therefore, the aim of this presentation was to present the results from a series of cross sectional studies that evaluated a range of psychological variables in people with PHP. Methods Three cross sectional studies were conducted separately at different time points. The first cross sectional study evaluated 84 people with PHP to determine the association between depression, anxiety and stress with foot pain and foot function. This was followed by a second study involving 45 people with PHP and 45 people without PHP to determine if symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress increased the likelihood of having PHP. A third cross sectional study evaluated the association between kinesiophobia and catastrophising with foot pain and foot function in 36 people with PHP. Hierarchical and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the data. Results For participants with PHP, stress and depression scores were significantly associated with foot function but not foot pain. When the data was stratified by sex, stress and depression were significant predictors of foot pain and function in females. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were found to increase the likelihood of having PHP. Finally, kinesiophobia and catastrophising were significantly associated with foot function, while catastrophising was associated with ‘first step’ pain in people with plantar heel pain. Discussion and clinical relevance In addition to addressing biological factors in the management of PHP, clinicians should consider the potential role of affective factors such as mood, and cognitive factors such as catastrophising and kinesiophobia which are equally important in the experience of pain in people with PHP. Podiatrists should contemplate the use of outcome measures to evaluate mood, anxiety, catastrophic thoughts and a fear of movement to help guide treatment that is viewed through a broader biopsychosocial model of health. O35 Insights from the Framingham Foot Study: Are key aspects of health being overlooked? Marian Hannan Marcus Institute for Aging Research, Hebrew SeniorLife and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Just as a good clinical examination asks directed queries about comorbidities and health to a patient to obtain an integrated understanding of the patient’s needs, so does a good research study add to our clinical insights. This session will use examples from the population-based Framingham Foot Study to highlight important key aspects of public health that may be overlooked yet essential perspectives as we consider the role that feet play in health and disease. Specific examples of current research evaluating the role of obesity will be presented. Important findings from the Foot Study will be discussed in relation to race/ethnicity, arthritis of the knee or hip, limitations in mobility, and disability. The need for early clinical intervention will be discussed as well as the evaluation of progression of foot conditions in persons prior to any clinical intervention. Finally, we will address what might be modifiable and what is not apt to change with clinical interventions. Research findings may provide understanding of underlying mechanisms for the diseases we see in our patients. Epidemiology, as a specific focus, tells us the public health impact… and the impact of foot disorders is huge: in the general population, the risk of disability due to foot problems is much larger than heart problems, dementia or lung disorders. And despite public demand for understanding of foot health, many clinicians and public health advocates ignore the role of the foot. Podiatry can merge with population sciences to encourage the integration of our knowledge so that key aspects of health are not overlooked. Our insights and public health knowledge are the keys to making a significant difference in foot health and advancing preventive efforts. O36 Preventing Overdiagnosis: how can we stop harming the healthy? Ray Moynihan Centre for Research in Evidence Based Practice , Bond University, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia This presentation will offer an overview of the complex and counter-intuitive health challenge of overdiagnosis, which has been described as a ‘modern epidemic’ causing harm and challenging the sustainability of health systems. It will explore both the problem and potential solutions to it. The presentation will draw on national and international evidence and analysis, and demonstrate how Australia is at the forefront of national attempts to understand and address overdiagnosis. In a nutshell, overdiagnosis happens when someone receives a diagnosis that does them more harm than good. It happens for example when a healthy person is diagnosed with a disease that will not actually ever cause them harm. The presentation will explain the nature of this vexing problem, and evidence which has attempted to estimate its extent across several conditions, including for example, thyroid, breast and prostate cancers. The presentation will also explore what might be driving this problem, such as changes in diagnostic technology – often used in screening programs – which can identify ever-smaller abnormalities, many of which will highly likely never to go on to cause harm. Drawing on recent work published in the British Medical Journal, BMJ, the presentation will also explore a wide range of potential solutions. A former award-winning journalist and author, Dr Moynihan is recognised internationally for his academic work on overdiagnosis, and the presentation will give a clear and compelling introduction to this problem and how we might collectively address it. O37 Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of musculoskeletal conditions in Australia and implications for podiatric practice Rachelle Buchbinder Monash Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Cabrini Institute, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia While early detection and treatment of disease brings benefits for many, there is increasing evidence of unnecessary testing and treatment, harming patients and diverting scarce resources from where they’re most needed. Overtesting and overtreatment is driven by many factors including clinician concern about missing diagnoses, increasingly sophisticated diagnostic tests which detect smaller and smaller abnormalities of uncertain prognosis, and screening programs that save lives but can also detect disease that won’t progress to cause harm. This leads to unnecessary treatment which can result in complications and harm to patients. There are many examples of overtesting, overdiagnosis and overtreatment of musculoskeletal conditions. For example, an MRI of the knee will show some abnormality in 84% of people over the age of 50 years who have knee pain, and in 20% it will show meniscal damage. However these changes are equally as common in people without knee pain. Failing to take account of the prevalence of these abnormalities in the asymptomatic population can result in needless worry for the patient, and unnecessary treatments like arthroscopy. This cascade of unnecessary tests and treatments harms the patient and places a financial burden both on the individual and the health service. This talk will provide examples of overdiagnosis and overtreatment relevant to podiatric practice in Australia and present some of the work of Wiser Healthcare, an Australian research collaboration that is investigating the cause and size of the problem and testing new solutions. O38 Palindromic rheumatism: Can arthritis that comes and goes hold the key to understanding RA? Anne-Maree Keenan1,2, Kulveer Mankia1,2, Paul Emery1,2 1Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom; 2NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre , Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom Correspondence: Anne-Maree Keenan Palindromic rheumatism (PR) a diagnostic label applied to episodes of self-limiting clinical arthritis, occasionally with skin disease. Symptoms are sudden onset of joint swelling which develops rapidly, lasts for a few hours or days then disappears. Attacks are usually mono-articular but with the site of joint pain often changing with each episode. While symptoms may affect any joint in the body with wrists, knees, shoulders, feet and ankles (in order of frequency) are most susceptible. Of note, almost half of patients with PR later develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA): understanding these patients may hold the key to understanding triggers for RA. Treatment for PR varies, but is generally centred on reducing inflammation and pain. The clinical appearance, differential diagnosis and imaging appearance is important for podiatrists to identify PR and refer on for early treatment This presentation will also present initial findings from our Birmingham-Leeds collaboration. With colleagues at Birmingham, we have identified the substantial patient burden of PR: patients experience a wide range of physical symptoms and report psychological and emotional distress, frequently exacerbated by a lack of information and the apparent therapeutic and prognostic uncertainty. Early results from imaging studies at Leeds has indicated for the first time that active PR demonstrated greater peri-articular soft tissue inflammation compared to active synovitis that is seen with RA, potentially explaining the difference in clinical symptoms.},

abstract={Îmbrăcămintea de protecţie pentru pompieri este compusă din trei straturi principale; un strat exterior, o barieră împotriva umezelii si o căptuşeală de izolaţie termică. Această structură de ţesături cu trei straturi asigură protecţie împotriva incendiilor şi mediilor cu temperatură foarte ridicată. Diverşi parametri, cum ar fi construcţia ţesăturii, greutatea, desimea în urzeală/bătătură, grosimea, rezistenţa la vapori de apă a straturilor de material textil, au efect asupra performanţei de protecţie, cum ar fi transferul de căldură prin îmbrăcămintea de protecţie pentru pompieri. Obiectivul acestui studiu este examinarea predictibilităţii indicelui de transfer de căldură al ţesăturilor cu trei straturi, ca funcţie a parametrilor ţesăturii, prin utilizarea reţelelor neurale artificiale. Prin urmare, s-au obţinut 64 combinaţii diferite de ţesături cu trei straturi pentru îmbrăcămintea de protecţie pentru pompieri, iar transferul de căldură prin convecţie (HTI) şi transferul de căldură radiant (RHTI), prin combinaţiile de ţesături, au fost măsurate în laborator. Şase reţele neurale cu perceptron multiplu (MLPNN), fiecare cu un singur strat ascuns şi aceleaşi 12 date de intrare, au fost construite separat pentru predicţia performanţei transferului de căldură prin convecţie şi a performanţei transferului de căldură radiant a ţesăturilor cu trei straturi. Reţelele 1-4 au fost instruite pentru predicţia HTI12, HTI24, RHTI12 şi, respectiv, RHTI24, în timp ce reţelele 5 şi 6 au avut două ieşiri, respectiv HTI12 şi HTI24, respectiv RHTi12 şi RHTi24. Fiecare sistem indică o bună corelare între valorile estimate şi valorile experimentale. Rezultatele demonstrează că MLPNN-urile propuse sunt capabile să estimeze transferul de căldură prin convecţie şi transferul de căldură radiant eficient. Cu toate acestea, reţeaua neurală cu două ieşiri are o performanţă de predicţie uşor mai bună.Alternate abstract:The firefighter protective clothing is comprised of three main layers; an outer shell, a moisture barrier and a thermal liner. This three-layered fabric structure provides protection against the fire and extremely hot environments. Various parameters such as fabric construction, weight, warp/weft count, warp/weft density, thickness, water vapour resistance of the fabric layers have effect on the protective performance as heat transfer through the firefighter clothing. In this study, it is aimed to examine the predictability of the heat transfer index of three-layered fabrics, as function of the fabric parameters using artificial neural networks. Therefore, 64 different three layered-fabric assembly combinations of the firefighter clothing were obtained and the convective heat transfer (HTI) and radiant heat transfer (RHTI) through the fabric combinations were measured in a laboratory. Six multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN) each with a single hidden layer and the same 12 input data were constructed to predict the convective heat transfer performance and the radiant heat transfer performance of three-layered fabrics separately. The networks 1 to 4 were trained to predict HTI12, HTI24, RHTI12, and RHTI24, respectively, while networks 5 and 6 had two outputs, HTI12 and HTI24, and RHTI12 and RHTI24, respectively. Each system indicates a good correlation between the predicted values and the experimental values. The results demonstrate that the proposed MLPNNs are able to predict the convective heat transfer and the radiant heat transfer effectively. However, the neural network with two outputs has slightly better prediction performance.},

abstract={The tumor suppressor p16Ink4a, encoded by the INK4a gene, is an inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinases 4 and 6, CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), resulting in cellular senescence through inhibition of E2F-mediated transcription of S phase genes required for cell proliferation. The p16Ink4a plays an important role in tumor suppression, whereby its deletion, mutation, or epigenetic silencing is a frequently observed genetic alteration in prostate cancer. To assess its roles and related molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we generated a mouse model with conditional deletion of p16Ink4a in prostatic luminal epithelium. The mice underwent oncogenic transformation and developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) from eight months of age, but failed to develop prostatic tumors. Given the prevalence of aberrant androgen signaling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we then generated R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice, in which conditional expression of the human AR transgene and deletion of p16Ink4a co-occur in prostatic luminal epithelial cells. While R26hARL/wt:PB-Cre4 mice showed no visible pathological changes, R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice displayed an early onset of high-grade PIN (HGPIN), prostatic carcinoma, and metastatic lesions. Strikingly, we observed tumors resembling human sarcomatoid carcinoma with intermixed focal regions of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) in the prostates of the compound mice. Further characterization of these tumors showed they were of luminal epithelial cell origin, and featured characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) with enhanced proliferative and invasive capabilities. Our results not only implicate a biological role for AR expression and p16Ink4a deletion in the pathogenesis of prostatic SRCC, but also provide a new and unique genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model for investigating the molecular mechanisms for SRCC development.},

abstract={Over the last decade, police departments across the United States have come under escalating pressure from the public, the media, civil rights organizations, and politicians to increase the accountability of their officers and departmental transparency, particularly regarding the use of force. In response to this pressure, many of the nation’s law enforcement agencies have either adopted or begun to explore body-worn camera technology. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, is not exempt from the body-worn camera phenomenon. Having explored the technology in 2014 and 2018, CBP is at a decisional crossroads regarding body-worn camera implementation.1] Many other departments have relied on the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of body-worn cameras to support their decision to adopt the technology. However, the most recent RCTs have produced mixed results as to whether body-worn cameras reduce the use of force or complaints. A 2015 RCT conducted in Las Vegas showed that body-worn cameras reduced the use of force and complaints against officers while a 2016 RCT conducted in Washington, D.C., revealed that the technology did not have a statistically significant effect on either area of concern.2] Many police departments have been quick to adopt the technology despite contradictory evidence concerning its effectiveness. However, neither the academic nor the law enforcement communities have closely examined its effectiveness in isolation or attempted to determine whether other means accomplish the same goals. It is unclear whether body-worn cameras have produced the benefits reported by some studies or if other peripheral measures taken by the departments involved in those studies are responsible. The cost of enterprise-wide body-worn camera implementation is staggering for an agency as large and geographically dispersed as CBP. Although the agency has not publicly released its internal cost estimates, a recent Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) report indicates that the average annual cost associated with body-worn cameras was $2,069 per camera.3] For CBP, this equates to approximately $103.45 million per year. This figure does not include any needed infrastructure upgrades such as increasing the bandwidth of CBP’s network and the physical construction costs associated with information technology upgrades. This cost will affect CBP’s ability to fund other border security initiatives. For example, the president has directed CBP to hire an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents; to that end, CBP’s fiscal year 2019 budget allocates $211 million to hire only 500 agents.4] The annual cost of body-worn cameras is equivalent to hiring 367 Border Patrol agents. To investigate the effectiveness of body-worn cameras beyond the results observed in the most recent RCTs, this thesis studies the cases of two large police departments and the impact of the peripheral measures and reforms they have taken in conjunction with body-worn camera implementation. It uses a comparative case study methodology to examine body-worn camera experiences as well as other reform initiatives of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) to help CBP leadership understand the potential efficacy of the technology and answer the question of whether CBP should adopt the use of body-worn cameras. Although empirical studies of body-worn cameras vary slightly, the majority measure the technology’s impact on officer use of force and citizen complaints against officers to judge the technology’s efficacy. By analyzing the other actions taken by the sample departments prior to the implementation of body-worn cameras and the impact of those actions on officer use of force and citizen complaints against officers, this thesis could determine whether the technology alone was effective at reducing the use of force and complaints or other reform measures were more effective. Data from the LVMPD and the MPDC suggest that the technology has not been more effective than other police reform measures at reducing the use of force and complaints within those departments. The CBP context resembles that of the LVMPD and the MPDC. The agency has implemented numerous reform measures similar to those undertaken by the LVMPD and the MPDC to address the use of force and complaints—with the exception of adopting body-worn camera technology. These measures included changes in use-of-force policies, increased focus on scenario-based training, implementation of use-of-force review boards, and an increased focus on providing the public timely information regarding use-of-force incidents, specifically deadly use of force. CBP’s results have been similar to those observed in the MPDC, despite the fact that CBP has not implemented a body-worn camera program. As observed in the MPDC, CBP’s use-of-force data suggest that these measures have had a positive impact on decreasing the number of CBP’s deadly force incidents.5] However, the use of less-lethal force has increased in both agencies.6] The LVMPD experienced different results. In 2017, after fully implementing its department-wide body-worn camera program, the department experienced a spike in deadly force incidents.7] However, the department has realized a significant reduction in less-lethal use of force.8] While CBP has not consistently published complaint statistics, overall complaints have risen in both the LVMPD and the MPDC despite body-worn camera implementation.9] According to findings from the case studies—and the similarities among CBP’s reformative measures and those of the departments studied—body-worn cameras are not likely to reduce CBP’s number of use-of-force incidents or complaints made against CBP law enforcement personnel. If CBP’s reasoning for adopting the technology is to address the use of force and complaints, the agency may not realize the desired results. However, if the agency’s reasoning for adopting body-worn cameras is to increase its transparency, CBP may realize that goal. As demonstrated by the LVMPD case study, departments have used the technology to provide more information to the public regarding use-of-force events. When departments release body-worn camera footage in a timely fashion and in conjunction with a formalized public information release program, the technology has shown promise in increasing transparency. Therefore, to realize a benefit in transparency, CBP will likely have to formalize a process for the timely release of body-worn camera footage of use-of-force events. Based on the impact of body-worn cameras on the areas of concern identified in this thesis, the findings do not support the adoption of the technology by CBP. However, it would be naïve to ignore the external pressures and expectations of the agency to do so.10] It would be equally imprudent not to acknowledge that body-worn cameras, perhaps erroneously, are now seen among the best practices of policing.11] Recognizing that the decision to implement body-worn cameras may not be based solely on the technology’s proven efficacy, this thesis makes the following recommendations if CBP decides to implement body-worn cameras. This research has shown that body-worn cameras may not have the impact expected by many of the stakeholders. Therefore, CBP should properly manage the stakeholders’ expectations. The agency should clearly express its reasoning for adopting the technology and be realistic as to what it expects from the technology. This research indicates that body-worn camera implementation does not necessarily equal a reduction in the use of force and complaints. Non-governmental organizations, political leaders, the public, and internal stakeholders should be made of aware of this fact. This thesis has also shown that CBP may be able to leverage body-worn camera technology to increase the agency’s transparency. To accomplish this, CBP should examine the LVMPD’s process of using body-worn camera footage in conjunction with a proactive public information release process. CBP needs to be willing and able to show the public and other concerned parties videos of use-of-force incidents in a timely manner to realize this benefit. 1] Customs and Border Protection, CBP Body-Worn Camera Feasibility Study and Camera Technology Report (Washington, DC: Department of Homeland Security, June 6, 2016), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/ default/files/publications/Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection%20-%20Body-Worn%20Camera% 20Feasibility%20Study%20and%20Camera%20Technology%20-%20FY%202015.pdf; and Customs and Border Protection, “CBP to Evaluate Incident Driven Video Recording System” (press release, Customs and Border Protection, May 1, 2018), https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-evaluate-incident-driven-video-recording-system. 2] Anthony Braga et al., The Benefits of Body-Worn Cameras: New Findings from a Randomized Controlled Trial at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (Arlington, VA: Center for Naval Analyses, September 28, 2017), https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/IRM-2017-U-016112-Final.pdf; and David Yokum, Anita Ravishankar, and Alexander Coppock, “Evaluating the Effects of Police Body-Worn Cameras: A Randomized Controlled Trial” (working paper, Lab @ DC, October 20, 2017), http://bwc. thelab.dc.gov/TheLabDC_MPD_BWC_Working_Paper_10.20.17.pdf. 3] Police Executive Research Forum, Cost and Benefits of Body-Worn Camera Deployments: Final Report (Washington DC: Police Executive Research Forum, April 2018), http://www.policeforum.org/ assets/BWCCostBenefit.pdf. 4] Executive Office of the President of the United States, “Stronger Border Security” (fact sheet, Executive Office of the President, 2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FY19-Budget-Fact-Sheet_Border-Security.pdf. 5] PolicyLink and Advancement Project, Values, Leadership, and Sustainability: Institutionalizing Community-Centered Policing (Washington, DC: PolicyLink, April 2015), http://www.policylink.org/ sites/default/files/Leadership_in_Policing_04282015_rev.pdf; Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia, 2000 Annual Report Force Investigation Team (Washington, DC: MPDC, 2001), https://mpdc. dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/fit_ar_00.pdf; Michael R.

abstract={Această lucrare experimentală este un efort de a identifica posibilitatea îmbunătăţirii performanţei de protecţie termică a îmbrăcămintei de protecţie pentru pompieri la diferite niveluri de densitate a fluxului de căldură. îmbunătăţirea performanţelor de protecţie termică înseamnă îmbunătăţirea timpului de expunere la fluxul de căldură, ceea ce va oferi un timp suplimentar pompierilor pentru a-şi îndeplini sarcinile, fără să sufere leziuni grave. Au fost investigate patru combinaţii multistrat diferite de îmbrăcăminte de protecţie pentru pompieri. Fiecare combinaţie constă dintr-o carcasă exterioară, barieră împotriva umidităţii si căptuşeală termică. De asemenea, a fost utilizată foaie de aerogel ca înlocuitor al barierei termice. Iniţial, s-au investigat proprietăţi cum ar fi rezistenţa termică, conductivitatea termică şi rezistenţa la vapori de apă ale ansamblurilor de ţesături multistrat. Ulterior, aceste combinaţii au fost expuse unor niveluri diferite de densitate a fluxului de căldură radiantă, de exemplu la 10, 20 şi 30 kW/m2 conform standardului ISO 6942. S-a observat că acele combinaţii în care pătura de aerogel a fost utilizată ca barieră termică dobândesc o rezistenţă termică mai mare, rezistenţă la vapori de apă şi valori mai reduse ale densităţii fluxului de căldură transmisă.Alternate abstract:This experimental work is an effort to seek the possibility of improvement in thermal protective performance of firefighter protective clothing at different levels of heat flux density. Improvement in thermal protective performance means enhancement in the time of exposure against the heat flux, which will provide extra time to firefighters to perform their duties without suffering from severe injuries. Four different multilayer combinations of firefighter protective clothing were investigated. Each combination consists of outer shell, moisture barrier and thermal liner. Aerogel sheet was also employed as a substitute to thermal barrier. Initially, properties like thermal resistance, thermal conductivity, and water vapor resistance of multilayer fabric assemblies were investigated. Later on these combinations were exposed to different levels of radiant heat flux density i.e. at 10, 20 and 30 kW/m2 as per ISO 6942 standard. It was noted that those combinations in which aerogel blanket was used as thermal barrier acquire greater thermal resistance, water vapor resistance and have less transmitted heat flux density values.},

abstract={Drug reaction w/ eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare but fatal druginduced hypersensitivity reaction w/ associated multi-organ failure (MOF). Liver injury is most common, resulting in hepatitis and/or progression to fulminant hepatic failure. Typical treatment is high dose steroids but rapid clinical improvement has been seen w/ cyclosporine. A 38-year-old female presented w/ 7 days of diffuse morbilliform rash, pruritus, lymphadenopathy, and facial swelling after starting allopurinol 2 months prior for acute gout. VS stable. Initial labs notable for ALT 119, AST 85, and INR 1.5. CBC, CMP otherwise unremarkable. Hepatitis panel negative. No hx of ETOH or APAP use. RUQ US showed hepatomegaly. She was initially diagnosed w/ an allergic drug reaction but after a few days developed fever and ALT/AST continued to rise. This was accompanied by rising eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes. Dermatology was consulted and initiated high dose steroids. Punch biopsy showed poor lymphocytic interface dermatitis w/ eosinophils, confirming DRESS. Allopurinol deemed likely culprit as EBV, HHV-6/7 were negative. Despite steroids, she progressively worsened w/ ALT and AST peaking at 972 and 172, respectively, INR stable. Cyclosporine 4mg/kg was then started. Rapid clinical improvement occurred and ALT/AST immediately reduced within one day of therapy. She was eventually discharged and followed up w/ dermatology outpatient. She remained on a prednisone/cyclosporine taper w/o additional flares. DRESS is a rare and life-threatening drug reaction often associated w/ a delayed latency period of 2 to 8 weeks w/ mortality of up to 10%. It is often associated w/ anticonvulsants and allopurinol. Hallmark features include fever, pruritus, maculopapular rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, and MOF. The liver is most commonly affected, generally presenting in a hepatocellular manner or less often a cholestatic or mixed picture. First-line treatment is cessation of inciting drug but systemic steroids are often the mainstay therapy if MOF occurs. Case reports have shown quick improvement in MOF, particularly hepatitis, w/ initiation of cyclosporine especially when steroids are ineffective or contraindicated. Our patient was a non-responder to high dose steroids but quickly improved after starting cyclosporine. Based on our case study, we recommend rapid initiation of cyclosporine to steroid nonresponders especially in the setting of DRESS-induced hepatitis.},

abstract={Background & Aims The effects of acute stress on allergic symptoms are little understood. The intention of this clinical study was to study the effects of acute stress and related mediators in allergic rhinitis (AR), taking the wheal and flare reaction in skin prick testing (SPT) as a readout. Methods 19 healthy and 21 AR patients were first subjected to SPTs with grass pollen-, birch pollen- and house dust mite allergen extracts, histamine and negative control. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a standardized Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), followed by SPT on the contralateral forearm. Stress responders were identified based on the salivary cortisol levels and State-subscale of State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). Blood samples were collected before and after TSST and adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, oxytocin, platelet activating factor and prostaglandin D2 were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Results SPT results of 14/21 allergics and 11/19 healthy who responded with stress after TSST were evaluated. No significant differences regarding SPT to allergens or histamine before and after the stress test could be calculated at the group level. But, the wheal and flare sizes after TSST increased or decreased substantially in several individuals, and unmasked sensitization in one “healthy” person, which could not be correlated with any mediator tested. The most significant finding, however, was that, independent of TSST, the baseline levels of oxytocin and noradrenaline were significantly higher in allergics. Conclusion High baseline levels of noradrenaline points toward higher stress levels in allergic patients, which might be counterregulated by elevated oxytocin. Moreover, our data indicate that acute stress may have a significant influence on SPT fidelity in susceptible individuals.},

abstract={Time constraints is the most critical factor that faces the first responders’ teams for search and rescue operations during the aftermath of natural disasters and hazardous areas. The utilization of robotic solutions to speed up search missions would help save the lives of humans who are in need of help as quickly as possible. With such a human-robot collaboration, by using autonomous robotic solutions, the first response team will be able to locate the causalities and possible victims in order to be able to drop emergency kits at their locations. This paper presents a design of vision-based neural network controller for the autonomous landing of a quadrotor on fixed and moving targets for Maritime Search and Rescue applications. The proposed controller does not require prior information about the target location and depends entirely on the vision system to estimate the target positions. Simulations of the proposed controller are presented using ROS Gazebo environment and are validated experimentally in the laboratory using a Parrot AR Drone system. The simulation and experimental results show the successful control of the quadrotor in autonomously landing on both fixed and moving landing platforms.},

abstract={A közelmúlt nemzetközi szintű krízisei - súlyos természeti és ipari katasztrófák, ebolajárvány, terrortámadások, menekültválság - rámutatnak arra, hogy a modern világ változó viszonyai egyre nehezebb körülményeket teremtenek a védekezésre hivatott szervezetek megfelelő módon történő reagálásához. A kormányzat részéről a közbiztonság magas szinten tartása emeli a közbizalmat. Krízishelyzetek kialakulásakor a lakosság a védekezés vezetését, az emberi életek és anyagi javak mentését elsősorban az arra hivatott kormányzati szervektől várja. A megváltozott viszonyok, a krízisek komplexitása, a „fekete hattyú"-események viszont arra mutatnak rá, hogy ezen események ellen a hagyományos, múltbeli tapasztalatok feldolgozásán alapuló klasszikus védelmi tervezés és reagálás nem hatékony, nem elegendő. Egy lehetséges nóvum a védelmi tervezés két különálló részre bontása. A már meglévő, jól működő hagyományos védelmi rendszer mellett egyre inkább szükséges egy attól elkülönülő, előrelátó, akár összetett krízishelyzeteket is megoldani képes másik rendszer, amelyet a kormányzatnak célszerű kiépíteni. Ez egy multidiszciplináris szakértőkből álló hálózat létrehozását jelentheti, ahol az egyes ágazatok, szakmák legjobbjai válnak képessé a döntéshozatal támogatására, valamint a hálózat előrejelezheti a várhatóan káros eseményeket, folyamatokat. Magyarország katasztrófavédelmi szempontból hatékony hagyományos veszélyhelyzeti tervezőrendszert működtet, a katasztrófák elleni védekezésbe pedig az állami és önkormányzati szerveket, intézményeket, a gazdaság szereplőit és magát a lakosságot is bevonja. A szerzők az ár- és belvíz elleni védekezés megvalósítása kapcsán vizsgálják a krízishelyzeteket, javaslatot fogalmazva meg a fejlesztéshez, a hatékonyság növeléséhez.Alternate abstract:The recent international crises - Ebola epidemic, terrorist attacks, migration and industrial disasters - showed that the changing relations of global modernization provides more and more demanding but sufficient reactions from the defending organizations. The government has to provide a high level of public safety and security standards, and this causes a strong public trust. In a crisis situation citizens expect the defence leadership and the rescue of human lives and goods from the nominated governmental organizations. The changing relations, the complexity of the crises and the black swan events showed, that the traditional (based upon the past events) planning and reactions are not efficient and sufficient. A new possibility is if the defence planning system will be divided into two different parts. One of them will be the good old traditional system, but there is a need for a forward-looking, complex crisis situation task solving system, which will be built by the government. This will be a special network of multi-disciplined experts, and this network will be able to provide early warning and help the decision-making. Hungary has an efficient disaster management system, but for planning, the traditional system is commonly used. In case of a disaster the country draws in citizens, self-governments, different institutions and economical actors. The authors introduce the traditional, as well as the new approach, and will examine crises in flood and inland water defence to make suggestions how to improve and make the system more efficient.},

abstract={Although the newly developed second-generation anti-androgen drug enzalutamide can repress prostate cancer progression significantly, it only extends the survival of prostate cancer patients by 4-6 months mainly due to the occurrence of enzalutamide resistance. Most of the previous studies on AR antagonist resistance have been focused on AR signaling. Therefore, the non-AR pathways on enzalutamide resistance remain largely unknown. By using C4-2, CWR22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines, as well as mice bearing CWR22Rv1 xenografts treated with either enzalutamide or metformin alone or in combination, we demonstrated that metformin is capable of reversing enzalutamide resistance and restores sensitivity of CWR22Rv1 xenografts to enzalutamide. We showed that metformin alleviated resistance to enzalutamide by inhibiting EMT. Furthermore, based on the effect of metformin on the activation of STAT3 and expression of TGF-β1, we propose that metformin exerts its effects by targeting the TGF-β1/STAT3 axis. These findings suggest that combination of metformin with enzalutamide could be a more efficacious therapeutic strategy for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.},

abstract={With the growing increase of disasters worldwide, in terms of frequencies, intensities and unpredictability, there is currently a growing need for novel ubiquitous communication systems enabling public safety networks (PSN). Disaster operations require real-time and low latency data communication, in live video and audio streaming, as well as in integration with social networks. In this context, existing network infrastructures might be either damaged or overloaded. Thus, it is expected that wireless Body-to-Body Networks (B2Bs) could play a key role in setting-up tactical PSN deployments enabling effective and reliable disaster response and management. In addition to the challenges with radio technologies and their inter-operability, coexistence and energy consumption issues, routing is also an important and critical challenge for the PSN. In this paper we propose a novel wireless B2B routing protocol, called "Optimized Routing Approach for Critical and Emergency Networks (ORACE-Net)" to enhance routing performance in disaster relief. ORACE-Net aims to exploit dynamic B2B communications between wearable networks to establish and maintain a mobile dynamic communication backbone. Analytical evaluations are conducted to analyze the communication overheads of ORACE-Net in comparison to existing routing standards, including Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector version 2 (AODVv2), Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) and Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR). Extensive simulations are then performed under realistic assumptions and synthetic mobility models, and show that ORACE-Net outperforms conventional routing approaches in terms of packet reception rate, energy consumption and fairly performed in terms of delay compared to the other approaches.},

abstract={Introduction Recent studies have brought to question the efficacy of the use of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia for victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Though guidelines recommend therapeutic hypothermia as a critical link in the chain of survival, the safety of this intervention, with the possibility of minimal treatment benefit, becomes important. Hypothesis/Problem This study examined prehospital therapeutic hypothermia for OHCA, its association with survival, and its complication profile in a large, metropolitan, fire-based Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system, where bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and post-arrest care are in the process of being optimized. Methods This evaluation was a retrospective chart review of all OHCA patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) treated with therapeutic hypothermia, from January 1, 2013 through November 30, 2013. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with initiation of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia with survival to hospital admission, the proportion of patients with initiation of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia with survival to hospital discharge, and the complication profile of therapeutic hypothermia in this population. The complication profile included several clinical, radiographic, and laboratory parameters. Exclusion criteria included: no prehospital therapeutic hypothermia initiation; no ROSC; and age of 17 year old or younger. Results Fifty-one post-cardiac arrest patients were identified that met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 61 years (SD=14.7 years), and 33 (72%) were male. The initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in 17 (37%) patients, and bystander CPR was performed in 28 (61%) patients with ROSC. Thirty-nine (85%) patients survived to hospital admission. Twenty-one patients (48%; 95% CI, 33-64) were administered vasopressors, 10 patients (24%; 95% CI, 10-37) were administered diuretics, and 19 patients (44%; 95% CI, 29-60) were administered antibiotics. Initial chest radiograph (CXR) findings were normal in 12 (29%) patients. Overall, 13 (28%; 95% CI, 15-42) study patients survived to hospital discharge. Conclusion Recent reports have questioned the efficacy and safety of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia. In this evaluation, in the setting of unstandardized post-arrest care, 85% of the patients survived to hospital admission and 28% survived to hospital discharge, with a complication profile which was similar to that noted in other studies. This suggests that further evidence may be needed before EMS systems stop administering therapeutic hypothermia to appropriately selected patients. In less-optimized systems, therapeutic hypothermia may still be an essential link in the chain of survival. Cortez E , Panchal AR , Davis J , Zeeb P , Keseg DP .

abstract={Introduction An adequate level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary when treating patients with highly infectious diseases or those contaminated with hazardous substances. Methods Following National Institute for Health Research's Research Centre (London, United Kingdom) approval, the authors of this study conducted a survey of specialist registrars' knowledge of the respiratory and skin protection requirements needed during a resuscitation scenario with Advanced Life Support. Participant responses were compared to UK national recommendations and to a previous survey in 2009. Results A total of 98 specialist registrars (in Anesthesiology, n=51; in Emergency Medicine (EM), n=21; and in Intensive Care Medicine (ICM) n=26) completed hand-delivered surveys. The best knowledge of PPE requirements (76%) was found for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with less knowledge about PPE requirements for anthrax, plague, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and smallpox (60%). The results show limited knowledge of PPE requirements (20%-30%) for various chemical warfare agents. Personal protective equipment knowledge regarding treatment of sarin-contaminated casualties was over-rated by 80%, and for patients with EVD, it was over-rated by up to 67% of participants. Conclusion The results of the tested cohort indicate that current knowledge regarding PPE for chemical warfare agents remains very limited.

title={Work environments and HIV prevention: a qualitative review and meta-synthesis of sex worker narratives},
journal={BMC Public Health},
volume={15},
note={Copyright - Copyright BioMed Central 2015; Last updated - 2023-07-21},
abstract={Background Sex workers (SWs) experience a disproportionately high burden of HIV, with evidence indicating that complex and dynamic factors within work environments play a critical role in mitigating or producing HIV risks in sex work. In light of sweeping policy efforts to further criminalize sex work globally, coupled with emerging calls for structural responses situated in labour and human-rights frameworks, this meta-synthesis of the qualitative and ethnographic literature sought to examine SWs' narratives to elucidate the ways in which physical, social and policy features of diverse work environments influence SWs' agency to engage in HIV prevention. Methods We conducted a meta-synthesis of qualitative and ethnographic studies published from 2008 to 2014 to elucidate SWs' narratives and lived experiences of the complex and nuanced ways in which physical, social, and policy features of indoor and outdoor work environments shape HIV prevention in the sex industry. Results Twenty-four qualitative and/or ethnographic studies were included in this meta-synthesis. SWs' narratives revealed the nuanced ways that physical, social, and policy features of work environments shaped HIV risk and interacted with macrostructural constraints (e.g., criminalization, stigma) and community determinants (e.g., sex worker empowerment initiatives) to shape SWs' agency in negotiating condom use. SWs' narratives revealed the ways in which the existence of occupational health and safety standards in indoor establishments, as well as protective practices of third parties (e.g., condom promotion) and other SWs/peers were critical ways of enhancing safety and sexual risk negotiation within indoor work environments. Additionally, working in settings where negative interactions with law enforcement were minimized (e.g., working in decriminalized contexts or environments in which peers/managers successfully deterred unjust policing practices) was critical for supporting SWs' agency to negotiate HIV prevention. Conclusions Policy reforms to remove punitive approaches to sex work, ensure supportive workplace standards and policies, and foster SWs' ability to work collectively are recommended to foster the realization of SWs' health and human rights across diverse settings. Future qualitative and mixed-methods research is recommended to ensure that HIV policies and programmes are grounded in SWs' voices and realities, particularly in more under-represented regions such as Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Published: 29 September 2015 PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP ABSTRACTS Assessments for the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court Robert Adler Private Practice, South Yarra, Australia Introduction: Robert (Bob) Adler is a child and adolescent psychiatrist. A large part of his practice involves providing reports of psychiatric assessments of parents and family reports for the Family Court of Australia (FCA) and the Federal Circuit Court (FCC). Workshop: The workshop will concentrate on the practical aspects of Family Court assessments, drawing on the author's experience and knowledge of the Family Law Act. Cited Family Law cases will be used to highlight some of the issues involved in such assessments. Background pre-reading will be provided to participants so that de-identified cases can be used in the workshop to highlight some of the challenges involved in this interesting but difficult work. Areas to be covered will include psychiatric assessment of parents, preparation of family reports, dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse and domestic violence, and giving evidence. Participants will be expected to have some experience in medico-legal assessment or at least a strong interest in developing such skills in relation to the Family Court. Key points/learning outcomes: By the end of the workshop participants will * have a basic understanding of the Family Law Act (1975) as it applies to child and parenting matters; * be able to conduct a psychiatric assessment of parents and prepare a report for the FCA and FCC; * be able to conduct a family assessment and prepare a family report; and * understand the basic principles of giving evidence. Australian aboriginal experience of place and its significance for health: an indigenist perspective Alasdair Vance1, Janet Mcgaw2 and Moira Rayner1 1Faculty of Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; 2Faculty of Architecture, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia Introduction: This workshop presents the findings from an ongoing significant engagement with the Victorian Aboriginal Traditional Owners about place, culture, and health. Workshop: Indigenist themes relevant for health will be described through discussing three young people that were all treatment non-responsive despite comprehensive assessment, formulation, and treatment approaches. All families were then engaged in a dialogue about their Aboriginal experience of place from an Indigenist perspective. Dominant themes of particular land and water features, totem characteristics, and ancestral connections emerged. These discussions facilitated a broader engagement in and deeper trust that enabled the journey to health. One interpretation is that the patients and their families developed a greater faith in the formulation and treatment planning processes previously trialled that then led to successful treatment outcomes. However, this workshop will contend that the pathway to health was more complex. Further, the environments within which Western medicine is practised pose significant, but not insurmountable, challenges. Key points/learning outcomes: Access to meaningful environments where country, totem, and story can be experienced and practised can be essential in the context of treatment and recovery from mental illness. Two inhibiting factors exist: the first is specific to Western health models; the second is a general consequence of the configuration of space in settler colonial nations. Cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment of suicidality in depressed adolescents Anthony Spirito Division of Clinical Psychology, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA Managing suicidal and depressed adolescent's needs to be in the skills set of all CAMHS clinicians. The workshop will cover the following topics: * conceptual model of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); * CBT for adolescent depression - effects on suicidality; * managing suicidality in therapy; * working with parents during suicidal crises; * CBT techniques for suicidality; and * special circumstances - alcohol abuse and suicidality. The workshop will be suited to clinicians with anywhere from novice to advanced skills. Somatic symptoms in children and adolescents: how the body signals stress, distress, or disruptions in physiological regulation Kasia Kozlowska1,2,3,4 1The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, Australia; 2Department of Psychiatry, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 3Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 4Brain Dynamics Centre, Westmead Millennium Institute of Medical Research, Westmead, Australia Introduction: Somatic symptoms are a common signal and expression of distress. These symptoms include dizziness, nausea, stress-induced vomiting, threat-induced fainting, pain, and functional neurological symptoms (paralysis, sensory loss, blindness, tremor, and non-epileptic seizures). Although somatic symptoms occur in children and adolescents across the globe, they are typically not addressed in training programmes in medicine or other health professions. Moreover, they can result in significant functional impairment, substantial burden on the family and health care system, and even in stigmatization, simply because they are not understood for what they are. Understanding somatic symptoms so that treatment interventions can be implemented is important across the disciplines of primary care, paediatrics, and child and adolescent psychiatry. Workshop: This workshop aims to provide clinicians with an updated theoretical framework for understanding the body systems that mediate stress-induced somatic symptoms. An overview of the key body systems involved in homeostasis and human responses to stress will be provided. Commonly occurring somatic symptoms and typical presentations will be discussed via brief vignettes. Treatment options will be discussed. It is hoped that the workshop will also elicit a discussion of cultural dimensions of somatic presentations in clinical practice. Key points/learning outcomes: * Knowledge of the broad range of somatic symptoms experienced in the context of stress. * Knowledge of underlying neurobiology underpinning different somatic symptoms. * Knowledge of the stress systems and their role in somatic symptoms. * What to look for during the assessment. * Helpful interventions. Mahi A Atua - introduction to a Maori therapeutic approach Diana Rangihuna1,2, Mark Kopua1,3 and Kataraina Miringaorangi1 1Gisborne CAMHS, Gisborne, New Zealand; 2Ngati Porou, New Zealand; 3Te Aitanga a Hauiti, Ngati Ira, Ngati Porou, New Zealand Introduction: Mahi a Atua is a Maori therapeutic approach which draws from Maori creation stories known as purakau to explore culturally relevant ways of assessing and treating mental health problems in Maori children, adolescents, and families. Many of these creation stories have commonalities with other Pacific traditions. Workshop: In this workshop, DR and MK will share selected creation stories and illustrate how they are used in their assessment and therapeutic work in an indigenous CAMHS setting, with Maori young people who present with a complex mix of psychiatric and psychosocial problems. They will show how this approach can very effectively engage Maori young people who may be well versed in traditional knowledge, or alternatively, may feel disconnected from their own culture. Dr. Rangihuna is a psychiatrist, who specialised in Indigenous Psychiatry, and is one of the developers of the Mahi a Atua approach. Mark Kopua is a tohunga, master tattooist, and carver, steeped in the use of purakau, and is employed as cultural therapist with the Gisborne CAMHS team. Key points/learning outcomes: By the end of this workshop, participants will be acquainted with a number of Maori creation stories and principles for applying these stories to the assessment and therapy with young people and their families. Such principles can also be applied to creation stories from other indigenous traditions. Conducting research to test interventions to improve mental health of children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries Ricardo Araya1,2 1Global Mental Health Centre, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom; 2Institute of Psychiatry, London, United Kingdom Introduction: This workshop aims to provide an introduction on design and methods to conduct research to develop and test the effectiveness of interventions to improve the mental health of children and adolescents, especially but not only in school settings. Workshop: An overview of methods that can be used with advantages and disadvantages. Some examples of a few studies that have been carried out will be presented to highlight potential challenges. Key points/learning outcomes: * Knowledge of the main research methods to test the effectiveness of interventions. * Knowledge of main advantages and disadvantages of different methods. * Critical review of some studies already completed in low- and middle-income countries. ORAL PRESENTATION ABSTRACTS (In order of presentation) DAY 1: Wednesday 30 September 2015 School interventions and mental health problems: learning from low- and middle-income countries Ricardo Araya Centre for Global Metal Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom Background: Mental health disorders can have devastating effects unless prevented or treated early and effectively. Schools offer an excellent opportunity to intervene with children and adolescents presenting mental health problems. Objectives: To review some of the evidence to show the effectiveness of school mental health interventions coming from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Methods: Systematic reviews and RCTs. Findings: Systematic reviews have shown small but positive effects of universal interventions on emotional disorders. However, most of this evidence comes from Western countries, few universal school-based interventions to treat or prevent emotional disorders have been conducted in LMIC. There is also limited positive evidence from trials for conduct disorders. Conclusions: The few studies in LMIC provide interesting insights on how best to approach this line of research in countries at all levels of development. There is a need to re-think approaches to better address the needs of children and adolescents in LMIC. Treatment of adolescent depression: the past, the present, and the future promise of experimental medicine Anthony Spirito Division of Clinical Psychology, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA The purpose of this presentation is to describe treatment research conducted over the last 15 years to advance knowledge regarding treatment of adolescent depression, particularly treatment resistant depression. First, the results of a major clinical trial for treatment resistant depression in adolescents will be discussed including moderators and predictors of treatment response. These findings will then be followed by a discussion of two recent treatment development trials designed to improve outcomes for depressed adolescents, one by treating a depressed parent concurrently with their depressed adolescent and a second trial in which an exercise regimen was added to a standard cognitive-behavioral treatment protocol. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of recent changes in treatment research priorities at the National Institute Mental Health in the United States including an emphasis on experimental medicine paradigms. The strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches will be discussed. International perspectives on promoting the mental health of children of parents with mental illness: translating our knowledge into COPMI practice Brad Morgan1, Nick Kowalenko2, Philip Robinson1, Monica Kakirau-Hagali3, Bronwyn Dunnachie4 and Bjorg Eva Skogoy5 1Emerging Minds, Adelaide Australia; 2University of Sydney, Australia; 3Division of Psychiatry, Port Moresby General Hospital, Papua New Guinea; 4Werry Centre, Auckland, New Zealand; 5Research Unit, Nordland Hospital Trust, Norway Background: 10-20% of all children live in families where parents are affected by mental illness. There is evidence that the mental health and well-being of children of parents with mental illness can be effectively promoted and problems prevented. Translating this into routine practice is the challenge addressed in these presentations. Objectives: 1) Participants will reflect on these nations' responses to addressing Australian Children of Parents with Mental Illness (COPMI) issues and reflect on similar opportunities in their own nations. 2) Participants will be aware of strategies for COPMI initiatives. Methods: There are opportunities for preventive practice in our clinical work, particularly with children in families affected by parental mental illness. This symposium will offer international perspectives by highlighting individual differences in each country, their different challenges as well as their opportunities to actively support this population. In describing key strategies developed by the COPMI initiative, the Australian presentation will highlight a national approach, review achievements, its limitations, and potential. The New Zealand COPMIA initiative has responded to local needs by including an additional focus on addictions. In Papua New Guinea, the approach taken maximizes community and extended family resources. Norway has promotion of COPMI needs enshrined in law. Findings: The presentations will provide a host of options for promoting systems change for COPMI. Conclusions: The translation of knowledge and best practice into routine care is a major challenge. Responses to this are being developed internationally. The Australian Children of Parents with Mental Illness Initiative Brad Morgan1, Nick Kowalenko2 and Philip Robinson1 1Emerging Minds, Adelaide, Australia; 2Discipline of Psychiatry, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia Background: The Australian Children of Parents with Mental Illness (COPMI) initiative began over 10 years ago. Objectives: Demonstrate how the initiative has 1. improved access to evidence-based information and resources for children and families, including user-driven strategies; 2. improved the capacity of the mental health workforce and increasing access to brief, evidence-based interventions for parents with a mental illness and their children; 3. developed organisational and systems support. Method: This presentation will examine the broad directions of the national COPMI initiative (based on the Ottowa Charter) and identify key partners in sustaining the initiative to date including how it links with state and local projects. Findings: Partnerships with family members, professionals, and organisations have assisted in the development of a range of health promotion materials for families, e-learning resources for professionals, and implementation guidance for organisations and systems. These co-designed resources have improved the accessibility of health promotion resources for family members, strengthened professional practice, and supported systems change in Australian services. Conclusions: Whilst substantial gains have been made significant gaps remain, including lack of 1) widespread implementation of evidence-informed approaches, 2) adequate access to COPMI services in recovery, acute care, mental health primary care, non-government services, 3) adequate models of care and consumer peer support, 4) stable funding, 5) integration of COPMI issues into routine care, and 6) adequate research and evaluation. Recommended strategies to close these gaps will be provided. Management of children of parents with mental illness in a low-income setting Monica Kakirau-Hagali Division of Psychiatry, Port Moresby General Hospital, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea Background: Working with families is an important area in the management of mental illness that contributes to recovery. Objective: To provide an overview of clinical experience in management of children of parents with mental illness within a cultural context, considering the cultural perspective. Methods: This paper will report on data collected from case notes and from interviewing nursing officers' experiences of how mentally ill patients were managed in their communities. Information is also from my experiences in how the mentally ill clients are treated in their own community. The inclusion criteria included known history of both parent and child with mental illness and where a parent with young children had mental illness. Information obtained included age of onset in the parent, age of onset in the child, care of children (if any) when parent becomes ill, where do the clients get support in the community and who becomes the main caregiver, what are the reasons for relapse and the follow-up management. Findings: Case notes were reviewed, and mental health workers were interviewed. The results show that the extended families involvement in the care and management of parents with mental illness and their children is of paramount importance to provide the safety net in a setting that lacks social welfare benefits and where most people are urban dwellers. Conclusion: In a developing country, the extended family system may provide the safety net to mitigate mental illness in the parents and to prevent mental illness from occurring in the children and promote mental well-being. With urbanisation this may be changing. Children of Parents with Mental Illness and Addictions: integrating care in New Zealand Bronwyn Dunnachie Werry Centre, Auckland, New Zealand Background: There is a national approach in New Zealand for these children. An Implementation Guideline seeks to support adult mental health and addiction clinicians to engage and partner with parents to support their children. Objectives: 1. To raise awareness of the diverse populations in New Zealand and their differing cultural needs with respect to implementing COPMIA-focused initiatives. 2. To describe the implementation strategies undertaken to date in recognition of the diverse population. Methods: Describe the strategies which have been undertaken and early findings in the implementation process to date. Findings: Community partnerships in recognition of cultural diversity have been a key part of New Zealand's development. Conclusion: Not taking informed, targeted, specific measures will result in poor outcomes with regard to implementation. Norwegian COPMI are protected by law: promoting systems change to translate policy into practice Bjorg Eva Skogoy Research Unit, Nordland Hospital Trust, Bodø, Norway Background: In 2010, Norway made changes in law to secure information provision and prevention strategies for children affected by all kinds of parental illness (mental illness, substance abuse problems, or severe somatic illness). All health personnel are obliged to develop preventive child- and family-focused practice. Hospitals must appoint special child responsible personnel to systematically support these changes. Objectives: 1. Provide an overview of the changes in law and national implementation strategies. 2. Describe awareness and readiness for change in Norway, and challenges in promoting systems change to translate policy into practice. Methods: For health personnel, child responsible personnel setting and managers, 1) responses to law, 2) family-focused practices, and 3) use of implementation drivers were measured (N=364). Findings: Initial results will be reported as will some preliminary findings from a national multicentre study, with responses from patients, partners, children, and teachers will also be presented. Systems change is differently organized in each hospital setting, and there are significant differences in the use of implementation drivers and delivery of family-focused practice. Conclusions: Changes in law have resulted in improved public and professional awareness of children affected by parental illness. Law and clinical guidelines are helpful, but not enough to secure information and appropriate help reaching children and families. Performance assessment is needed, and leadership should facilitate implementation and secure sustainable systems change. This presentation will provide emerging evidence to guide managing and monitoring such changes. Exploring the availability and utility of technological interventions for parents with depression Gordana Culjak1, Arnold Kamis2, Nick Kowalenko3 and Benjamin Hoadley4 1Discipline of Psychiatry, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 2Sawyer Business School, Suffolk University, Hartford, CT, USA; 3Discipline of Psychiatry, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 4Northern Sydney Local Health District, Sydney, Australia Background: Treating parental depression is important for the health outcomes of both the parent and child. Barriers to accessing treatment may be more significant in parents. Technological interventions, such as online treatments, may help minimise such barriers. Treatment guidelines reference the use of technological interventions, and there is a need to establish an evidence base. Objectives: Ascertain the evidence base supporting technological interventions for parents with depression. Methods: In order to investigate the levels of evidence available to date on the effectiveness of online programmes for parents suffering from mild-to-moderate depression, a literature review, and hand searching of references in peer-reviewed publications was conducted by the authors. Findings and conclusions: Several studies have looked at the effect of technological interventions on depressive symptoms in parents as secondary outcome measures. Only three pilot studies, however, were found that have specifically examined the area of online interventions. The collated data are suggestive of possible benefit of technological interventions but larger scale trials are needed. Growing up in Vanuatu Colin Kable Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Private Practice, Newcastle, Australia Background: There are distinctive factors that affect child development in South Pacific Nations. These begin before conception and continue throughout the lifespan. Objectives: There are many challenges to cognitive and psychological development of children and young people. Using Vanuatu as an example, the role of diet, poverty, education, health literacy, and cultural practices will be discussed. The focus will be on those for which there is the potential for change and will highlight some of the difficulties implementing effective interventions. Methods: The author has been traveling between Australia and Vanuatu as a volunteer since 2010. Total time on the ground has been over a year, with in schools and health education along with direct intervention programs. It has involved living in villages in poorer areas, mainly on the island of Efate. This presentation will highlight the challenges of health interventions for Ni-Vanuatu children from direct experience and suggest some culturally appropriate approaches. Jack of all trades, master of none-specialism is so first world! Epenesa Olo-Whaanga1 and Rangi Fariu2 1Waitemata District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; 2Cook Islands Ministry of Health, Rarotonga, Cook Islands Background: Specialist visits have been a feature of the health landscape in the Cook Islands. An adult psychiatrist has been on this schedule and until recently, child and adolescent mental health has been a gap. Mental health service delivery in the Cook Islands has been targeted toward adults. In providing visiting psychologist support for children, it became evident that a purely specialist role would need to take into account that other disciplines did not exist to build a service that would be expected in first world countries. Hence having to think differently about assessments and interventions was necessary to be useful to the referred population. These will be discussed. Objectives: The audience will be presented with some of the dilemmas present when working cross-culturally with specialist 'outside' knowledge and some of the barriers and successes of committing to this work. This should increase their awareness of working cross-culturally and some of the dilemmas faced where there are no specialists that are taken for granted in first world countries. Methods: A presentation of three visits to the Cook Islands from an infant, child, and adolescent mental health psychologist with the Country's only resident psychiatrist will be presented. Findings and conclusions: Some of the reflections of doing this work and possible directions will be discussed. The Pacific Islands have high numbers of children and their psychological, emotional, educational wellbeing is important. This is also true of their host countries like New Zealand and Australia where the youthfulness of the Pacific Island population is markedly different from the mainstream population. Evidence-based medicine under difficult circumstances: quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy Brett McDermott1, Vanessa Cobham2 and Nancy Westerman3 1Mater Research, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia; 2Department of Psychology, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia; 3Kids in Mind Research, Queensland Health, South Brisbane, Australia Nineteen primary school children who were involved in a serious natural disaster received a manualised TF-CBT intervention. All participants were identified by a two-stage screening process and at stage 1, scored in the clinical range on measures of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. At stage 2, children met diagnostic criteria for PTSD or disaster-related anxiety on a structured research interview. This presentation will briefly detail the assessment process and the key elements of the 10 session intervention. Treatment outcomes include significant improvement of all participants to the point where 85% of participants post-treatment were diagnosis free, 100% were diagnosis free at 12 months follow-up. All therapy sessions were recorded, transcribed and the text subject to qualitative analysis. During the course of therapy, there were significant changes in the retelling of the trauma story including an initial increase in detail and elaboration followed by subsequent compression. Stories also became more coherent and a marked decrease in distress when discussing 'hot spots' was also noted. The presentation concludes with implications for service delivery and future research. Treating chronically traumatized children. Don't let sleeping dogs lie! Arianne Struik Institute for Chronically Traumatized Children (ICTC), Perth, Australia The Sleeping Dogs method (1) is developed to treat the most difficult, resistant, not-motivated chronically traumatized children and adolescents. Growing up with their families, they have witnessed violence and have been abused and neglected. Some are in care of Child Protection residing in foster families or residential care. These children can be very avoidant or deny, 'forget' or dissociate their traumatic memories. Trauma processing seems impossible and the temptation to 'let sleeping dogs lie' and not focus on processing the traumatic memories can be strong. But all children deserve a chance to heal and recover, and the purpose of this method is to focus treatment on safe trauma processing as soon as possible. The Sleeping Dogs method has a Six Test Form to analyse these stuck cases and plan treatment. Six items are considered: safety, daily life, attachment, emotion regulation, cognitive shift, and nutshell to discover why the child is resistant or why treatment does not have the expected effect. Sleeping Dogs also provides interventions to improve the stability and motivation of the child. This method integrates all interventions and structures its coherence: therapy for the child, parental guidance, parent-child interaction and attachment work, and decision making by Child Protection. Sleeping Dogs combined with EDMR has been successfully used internationally and with Indigenous families in the outback of Western Australia. The research data of a pilot study show that this is a promising and relatively short method. Reference 1. Struik A. Treating chronically traumatized children: don't let sleeping dogs lie!

DAY 2: Thursday 1 October 2015 Addressing the mental health needs for youth on Kaua'i through an integrated program: a clinical and cultural perspective following the aftermath of hurricane Iniki Chia Granda State of Hawai'i, Department of Health, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Division, Kaua'i Family Guidance Center, Lihue, HI, USA Background/findings and conclusions: Kaua'i was devastated by Hurricane Iniki in 1992. It was the most powerful hurricane to strike Hawai'i in recorded history. It left more than 10% of the island homeless and a much greater percentage with severe damage to their home. However, as a silver lining, the devastation brought awareness to the mental health needs for youth on the island. Initially framed as 'Hurricane Iniki stress relief', Hawaii's department of health, in conjunction with department of education-integrated resources to provide youth with mental health treatment. The program aimed to improve access to care, reduce stigma, maximize resources, and attract highly qualified clinicians to provide treatment on school campuses. However, challenges related to competing needs and objectives between departments impacted the sustainability of the program. Solutions for increasing access to treatment and quality of care have been underway and have included thoughtful treatment planning through a bio-psycho-social-cultural formulation with close collaboration between various providers and agencies. Objectives: 1. Review the history of the Mokihana program. 2. Understand the nuances in developing a system of care in a pacific rural area including the challenges (multigenerational and historical trauma) with implementing evidence-based treatments. 3. Discuss barriers and potential solutions. Hoki Ki Te Rito-Mellow Parenting - working across cultures in South Auckland A collaboration to support families with multiple adversity factors initiated by Counties Manukau District Health Board to adapt, pilot, and evaluate the Mellow Parenting Programme. Seonaigh Stevens Te Whare Marie Ki Puketiro, Maori Mental Health Specialty Services Child Adolescent and Family Service Capital and Coast District Health Board, Wellington, New Zealand Background: In 2007, Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) engaged Ohomairangi Trust to pilot the Mellow Parenting programme (1) with disadvantaged families in South Auckland. Positive results led to an extended study with two providers, Ohomairangi Trust and Anglican Trust for Women and Children (ATWC) delivering the programme to over 60 families. The symposium introduces the Mellow Parenting programme, its philosophy, content, delivery, and results. Objectives: The work is focussed on strengthening parent-child relationships and building resilience. Mellow Parenting/Hoki ki te Rito Parenting programme (a cultural adaptation of Mellow Parenting), addresses psychosocial, mental health, and parenting issues in vulnerable families. The ways in which the two agencies worked with the Werry Centre who evaluated the programme, and then went on to streamline the delivery of the programme will be discussed. Measures of parent wellbeing, parent coping, child development, and child behaviour had promising results. Conclusions: There was strong evidence of improvement in mother's mental wellbeing, and coping skills, as well as children's behaviour, suggesting that this programme is a good fit with the parents who attended.

In response to requests from Maori mothers participating in Hoki ki te Rito/Mellow Parenting, to provide support for their partners in parenting, the Mellow Dads programme was adapted to support Maori fathers. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of Hoki ki te Rito-Oranga Whanau/Mellow Parenting programme, for Maori and Pacific mothers and fathers in New Zealand. Method: Five groups comprising 32 fathers and 48 mothers, with children aged between 0 and 5 years, where there were relationship difficulties, adult addiction issues, or child behaviour problems, received the programme. Measures included parents' self-reported competence, stress and wellbeing, and coded videos of parent-child interactions on home videos. Children's behaviour and development was assessed. Focus groups were held towards the end of each programme. Findings: Parents reported a significant increase in their own wellbeing, their ability to cope with their parenting role/children's behaviours, their feelings of self-esteem and adequacy, along with a reduction in unwanted problematic behaviours from their children, and an increase in children's social skills. Effects were maintained at 3 and 12 months follow-up. Qualitative data showed positive responses to the programme resources, content, and process. Conclusions: Empirical support for the effectiveness and acceptability of this culturally adapted version of Mellow Parenting-Hoki ki te Rito-Oranga Whanau is clear, demonstrating appropriate service provision for Maori and Pacific families.

Ann Am Acad Pol Soc Sci 2009; 642: 29-48. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10464-009-9293-1 Hoki Ki Te Rito/Mellow Parenting for teen mothers Phillippa Lilburn Ohomairangi Trust, Early Intervention Service, Auckland, New Zealand Background: New Zealand has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the world with 50 teenage girls in every 1,000 becoming pregnant. Upwards of 3,800 babies are born to teenage parents in New Zealand every year. The consensus in the literature appears to be that children of teenage parents have poorer outcomes than do children of older parents (1). Teenage motherhood has been associated with limited education, struggles to cope with the challenges of adolescence and come to terms with the parenting role (2). Research that looks at resiliency factors associated with better outcomes for teenage mothers and their children cites education and access to targeted parenting programmes as being important (3). Methods: Fourteen sessions of Hoki ki te Rito/Mellow Parenting were provided to a group of teenage Maori and Pasifika mothers in a Teen Parenting Unit in a secondary school in South Auckland. Pre and post measures were General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30), Parenting Daily Hassles Scale (PDH), Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Social Emotional (ASQ-SE), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Findings: The measures showed an increase in the mothers' wellbeing, a decrease in parenting problems, and a decrease in mothers' rating of their children's difficulties. Qualitative data were also collected about parent enjoyment of topics, changes in perception and understanding of children, intergenerational parenting, the vulnerability and strengths of teenage mothers. Reflections of the facilitators including delivery of the programme in a school setting are also discussed. 1. Coley RL, Chase-Lansdale PL.

Mellow Bumps - an attachment-based antenatal programme trial Alex Van Tuyl and Tawera Ormbsy Ohomairangi Trust, Auckland, New Zealand Introduction: There is evidence that maternal mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy can have a significant impact on child developmental, psychological, and behavioural outcomes (1, 2). Following the success of Mellow Parenting adaptations for mothers and fathers, Ohomairangi Trust decided to trial Mellow Bumps with young mothers to be, who were being referred. Method: Young mothers to be were recruited into Mellow Bumps between 20 and 30 weeks of their pregnancies and the programme content and process were trialled with them. Some brought their partners, others, their mothers, or sisters as support. The Adult Wellbeing Scale is a validated 18-question measure which detects potential problem scores on four dimensions: anxiety, depression, and inward- and outward-directed irritability. The scale has been used extensively to evaluate the impact of an antenatal group-based intervention; participants completed the measure pre- and post-intervention. Results: Data showed decreases on all four dimensions of the Adult Wellbeing Scale, with a significant difference in self-reported anxiety and outward-directed irritability. Qualitative feedback from participants and group facilitators has been largely positive with participants reporting increased relaxation skills, increased connection to their baby, and decreased social isolation. Some mothers were able to also address critical issues such as domestic violence through the use of strategies introduced during the sessions. Conclusions: Results indicate that when a group is delivered in line with the programme manual and training, it can have a positive impact on group participant's wellbeing and is an acceptable intervention. 1.

'O Tausaga O Le Tau Totogo' I Aotearoa: an adaptation of the Incredible Years Parent Management Training for Pasefika parents in New Zealand Mercy Drummond1,2,3 1Incredible Years Parenting Programme, Porirua, New Zealand; 2Health Pasefika Child Adolescent Mental Health Service, Porirua, New Zealand; 3Capital Coast District Health Board/3DHBs, Porirua, New Zealand Incredible Years Parent Management Training is an evidence-based prevention, education, and treatment programme, which has been shown to be very effective in the last 30 years for child adolescent mental health conditions such as conduct disorder, attention-deficit hyperactive disorder, and a range of other disruptive behaviour problems. This programme has been supported by the New Zealand Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, and the Werry Centre and adopted by many mainstream child adolescent mental health services in Aotearoa/New Zealand. This presentation will describe the development of an adaptation of this programme for Pasefika parents, resulting from a collaboration between a Pasefika Child Adolescent Mental Health and the local Samoan church and other non-government organisations. Evaluation results will be presented from these groups of Pasefika parents who completed the programme. Following the lead of an infant and advocating for a father - how the Watch, Wait and Wonder® intervention was supported and used with a Chinese family Seonaigh Stevens Te Whare Marie Ki Puketiro Maori Mental Health Specialty Services Child and Adolescent Family Service Capital and Coast District Health Board, Wellington, New Zealand Background: An assessment was undertaken for admission for a Chinese mother and child to a residential parenting programme. During this assessment, the infant demonstrated the importance of his father to him. This resulted in some creative thinking and collaboration with the child protection agency and the residential facility to create a suitable outcome to protect this family. The presentation will include video footage of the assessment and subsequent therapeutic process using the Watch, Wait and Wonder® (WWW) intervention (1). Objectives: Our objectives during this assessment process and consideration for treatment were to: to act on our observations during the assessment, to consider the needs of the whole family, to keep the needs of the infant uppermost, and to remain mindful of the cultural needs of this family. Methods: We extended our normal assessment process. We then negotiated with the referrer, the child protection agency, to consider the particular needs of this family. The WWW® therapy was chosen to suit this family with added supports to address the family's particular cultural needs. Findings and conclusions: This family remained together. The WWW® intervention produced helpful change with the mother expressing gratitude for an improved relationship with her son and husband. Careful consideration of the particular needs of a family has optimized the impact of the therapy offered to this family. Reference 1. Muir E, Lojkasek M, Cohen N.

These include a lack of readily accessible and comprehensive training programmes in Pacific settings, and the lack of easily accessible and affordable options for further training in neighbouring countries such as New Zealand and Australia. For those who do manage to overcome these considerable hurdles and enter RANZCP college-approved training programmes, there are significant barriers to returning to their Pacific nations of origin. Objectives and methods: This symposium will include a broad range of perspectives on training experiences from doctors from Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and the Cook Islands and feature a panel discussion that will canvas a range of options regarding future Pacific pathways for training in psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry, with reference to training programmes that exist in the Pacific for other medical and surgical specialties. Pasifika Study Group - review of the two-day workshop in Vanuatu Allister Bush1, Nick Kowalenko2, Francis Agnew3, Staverton (Tony) Kautoke4, Epenesa Olo-Whaaga3, Stephen Stathis5, Chia Granda6 and Regional Pacific Delegates 1Capital Coast District Health Board, Porirua, New Zealand; 2Discipline of Psychiatry, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 3Waitemata District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; 4Counties Manukau District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; 5Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; 6Kauai Family Guidance Centre, Lihue, HI, USA Background: The Pasifika Study Group (PSG) is a regional forum bringing together mental health professionals working with children and adolescents and their families from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Fiji, Hawai'i, and other Pacific nations, with child and adolescent psychiatrists and psychologists from New Zealand and Australia. The PSG which first met in conjunction with the FCAP conference in Melbourne in 2013 was this year jointly hosted by FCAP and the PMA on 28th and 29th September, just prior to the joint FCAP, PMA, and VMDA conference here in Vanuatu. This year's guest speaker was Dr. Chia Granda. Objectives: The symposium will provide an overview and summary of the two-day PSG to the conference. It will identify directions and goals for further engagement. Methods: Pacific participants will briefly present an update of child and adolescent mental health in their country of origin and what has emerged from the PSG process. Australian and New Zealand perspectives on learnings from the PSG will be presented. Keeping an eye on human rights to promote the mental health of children and young people and their families Ernest Hunter1,2, Robert Adler3 and Nick Kowalenko4 1Regional Psychiatrist, Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service, Australia; 2Adjunct Professor, James Cook University, Cairns, QLD, Australia; 3Psychiatrist in private practice, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 4Sydney University, NSW & Chair, FCAP, RANZCP, Australia Background: Human rights in our region, especially those of children, young people, and their parents are the foundation stone for well-being, community health, and mental health recovery. Promoting and observing the maintenance of human rights (including noting their disruptions) is a core task for health care professionals. Objectives: 1. Participants will reflect on key human rights issues in the region to better understand their impact on well-being and mental health. 2. Participants will learn about strategies and findings related to human rights practices in the region. 3. Participants will reflect on their ethical obligations in diverse settings, and legal and policy frameworks. Method: This symposium will describe some of the key human rights issues in the region, focussing on the rights of people with mental health disabilities and children in immigration detention. Paper 1 focuses on human rights as fundamental to the training of mental health leaders in the Western Pacific. Paper 2 describes experiences in offshore detention centres in Nauru, concerns about border protection policies and changes to the Border Force Act. Paper 3 addresses the findings of the 2014 Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into children in immigration detention. Findings: Monitoring the observation of human rights has revealed some blind spots. Recommendations for remediation are not being implemented. Conclusion: Observing human rights presents an ongoing challenge for our profession, our communities, and our ethical practice. More or different? Building capacity in the mental health sector in island nations of the Western Pacific Ernest Hunter1,2 1Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service, Cairns, Australia; 2College of Public Health, Medical & Vet Sciences, James Cook University, Cairns, Australia Background: The island nations of the Western Pacific are exposed to a range of forces that are consequential for mental health and wellbeing, climate change, and the economic/demographic transformations of globalisation being but the most obvious. With the pace of change being rapid and involving sometimes harsh political realities, it should be of no surprise that the development of mental health services has remained a relatively low priority across the region. Objectives: To describe the 1. importance of human rights practice in training for mental health leadership and 2. preliminary evaluation of a mental health leadership course in the Western Pacific. Method: There have been various approaches to improving local capacity, and this author was involved in one such exercise in Micronesia some three decades ago. In this presentation, an initiative will be described to support leadership in mental health, building on the now decade-old course run through Sangath in Goa, inspired and directed by Vikram Patel. Central pillars of that course will be presented, namely 1. the emphasis on leadership roles in supporting the rights of people with mental health disabilities; 2. unpacking the burden of mental disorders as they impact local communities and economies; and 3. identifying evidenced-based interventions that are replicable and scalable. The background to this initiative and a review of regional mental health literature will be presented. Findings: Preliminary evaluation of the course will be presented, and implications for child and adolescent populations will be elaborated. Conclusions: Building mental health capacity in low- and middle-income countries demands more than replicating the paradigms of service delivery in advanced economies and relies on appropriate human rights standards to promote health. 'What you are doing to me is not just?' Simone Weil (1942), La Personne et Le Sacre Robert (Bob) Adler Private Practice, Melbourne, Australia Background: RA went to Christmas Island and Nauru as a psychiatrist, employed by IHMS in the late 2014. He was so distressed by what he saw that he felt compelled to write to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition expressing his concerns about Australia's policies in regard to asylum seekers who arrive by boat. The outcome was that he was told by IHMS that he was no longer welcome at any detention centre. Objectives are that: 1. participants gain a better understanding of the tensions faced by asylum seekers undertaking such journeys; 2. participants will learn of the implications of the Australian Border Forces Act (ABFA) on themselves; and 3. participants will reflect on their ethical obligations as psychiatrists in relation to these issues. Method: The presentation will place the issue facing Australia in an international context, as illustrated by asylum seekers who undertake a similarly hazardous journey across the Mediterranean. Findings: RA will describe something of his experiences, particularly on Nauru, against the backdrop of his own experiences when his parents fled communist Hungary in 1949, with the help of people smugglers. He will also consider the implications of the ABFA (2015) which was recently passed by the Australian Parliament with bipartisan support. It appears that this Act is designed to intimidate health professionals and others into silence. Conclusion: While acknowledging the importance of 'Stopping the Boats' to prevent people drowning at sea, he believes that a more humane approach is needed for those who arrive on our shores by boat. Based on his experiences, RA passionately believes that what we as nation are doing to asylum seekers is simply 'not just'. Human rights and children in immigration detention Nick Kowalenko1,2 1Discipline of Psychiatry, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 2RANZCP, Melbourne, Australia Background: In 2004, The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) conducted an Inquiry (Last Resort) into children in immigration detention. In 2014, AHRC again conducted such an Inquiry (The Forgotten Children). Psychiatrists and a host of other medical and allied health professionals, but particularly child and adolescent psychiatrists, participated actively in both these inquiries. Each found that immigration detention, and the policies that sustained it, caused harm to children and their families and had a deleterious impact on their mental health and wellbeing. Objectives: This presentation aims to familiarise participants with the findings of the AHRC Inquiries. Implications of the findings will be explored and their impact on the community, the profession, and professional practice considered. Method: Data from both Inquiries will be summarised, and their findings will be presented. Findings: Both AHRC Inquiries found that children in immigration detention suffered socially and emotionally from detention and were harmed by it. There was evidence that both physical and mental problems and disorders occurred at high rates and a significant proportion of this could be reasonably attributed to both detention and the manner in which it occurred (e.g. its duration). There is evidence that human rights violations caused harm to children. Conclusions: Current Australian immigration policy and practice continues to cause harm to children. Should this be of concern to child psychiatrists: how should ANZ psychiatrists and helping professionals manifest their position on this issue? What are likely to be the most effective strategies to do so? Maternal and child: sharing experiences from low- and middle-income settings Ricardo Araya Centre for Global Metal Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom Background: Maternal health is closely linked to the wellbeing of children. During the perinatal period, mothers are likely to experience mental health problems. If these disorders go untreated, they might have detrimental effects on the wellbeing of mothers and children. Objectives: To review some recent experiences from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) to improve the mental health of mothers and children. Methods: Reviews and RCTs. Findings: There are several studies showing positive results to improve the wellbeing of mothers during the perinatal period. The evidence showing that these interventions might have a favourable impact on children is less clear. Conclusions: Improving the mental health of women during the perinatal period in LMIC might be possible, and it is justified on its own right. However, there seem to be unrealistic expectations as to what can be gained by children. Training child psychiatrists for areas of need Magella Lajoie1,2, Huu Kim Le1,3, Jarret Johnston4, Susan Blinkhorn5, Caroline De Vries2 and Ian Mccracken2 1New South Wales Institute of Psychiatry, Sydney, Australia; 2Hunter New England Local Health District, Newcastle, Australia; 3Northern Sydney Area Health Network, Sydney, Australia; 4Child and Adolescent Services, Orange, Australia; 5Wollemi Kids Adolescent Unit, Orange, Australia Background: The author, in her dual role as Director of Advanced Child Psychiatry Training and fly-in rural CAMHS child psychiatrist, offers an insight and opportunities to reflect on child psychiatry training for areas of need, specifically for rural child psychiatry. Objectives: To identify the elements that contributes to the good enough training of the next generation of child psychiatrists. Looking through the lens of rural child psychiatry training and supervisory experience, some of the elements identified include 1. clinical work and supervision in rural areas; 2. service provision versus training needs; 3. CBFP - how it will enhance child psychiatry training and what it cannot do; 4. collaborations, relationships, and teams - understanding and developing them; 5. the needs of rural communities; 6. ongoing education and collegiate relationships; and 7. critical mass - how many child psychiatrists does our community need? Methods: Dr. de Vries and Dr. McCracken have trained in a federally funded Specialist Training Position in Rural Child Psychiatry/Medical Education. Dr. McCracken established a COS group for fathers in Biripi, the Taree Aboriginal Mental Health Service. Their experience is contrasted with that of Dr. Johnston, and his supervisor, who lives, works, and gained most of his advanced child psychiatry training experience in a large rural city. Dr. Le will reflect on his experience in Micronesia as a young registrar. Findings and conclusions: Rural child psychiatry, as an exemplar of an area of need, exposes the breadth as well as the restrictions of child psychiatry training. There is a need for a broader and ongoing conversation within the faculty on what constitutes a good enough child psychiatrist across a range of clinical settings and community demands. Overview of stage 3, advanced child and adolescent certificate training - workshop Prue Mcevoy and Sally Tregenza Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, Australia Background: 2016 (Dec 2015 for NZ) will see the change of the RANZCP Fellowship Program to the 2012 program for all trainees. This will mean the majority of Advanced Trainees in child and adolescent psychiatry will require supervision under the new regulations. Objectives: Aim of this workshop is to provide an overview to supervisors of the 2012 Fellowship Program and provide them with the skills to enable them to implement the formative and summative assessments required in this program. Methods: The workshop will review the assessment modalities including Entrustable Professional Activities that have been developed for the certificate program and enable discussion and role play the range of Workplace Based Assessments if required. The workshop will also focus on providing formative and summative feedback to trainees. This will be enhanced by a discussion of developmental descriptors for each of the competencies. This will enable supervisors who have not had experience with Stage 2 training to update their knowledge around the new program. Travel: enhancing CAP advanced training overseas Huu Kim Le Northern Sydney Area Health Service, NSW Institute of Psychiatry, Sydney, Australia Background: Surveys on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) advanced training in Australia have identified that for trainees, local workplace factors are most important (1). Trainees are motivated by their enjoyment of their clinical work and engagement of the broader system of the child. Trainees have reported that they are not motivated by research and find aspects of the workplace system unappealing. These factors play an integral role in the recruitment, retention, and research involvement of CAP trainees. Objectives: This presentation will highlight how international experiences through volunteering and clinical fellowships can enhance CAP training. This presentation hopes to inspire local teaching networks to encourage trainees to seek international experiences as part of their training. By the end of the presentation, it aims to stimulate more connectedness and networking within the FCAP international conference (2). Methods: Specific reference to the cross-cultural experiences with the AusAid volunteer program in Micronesia in 2013 and the Clinical Training Fellowship in Singapore in 2015. Including Australian and local journal articles on CAP training in Australia and overseas. Conclusions: Overseas training in communities outside our own can provide a valuable foundation for trainees early in their careers. By leaving the local area system for foreign communities outside their own, trainees may realise that the world is a part of the broader system of the child. These experiences may motivate trainees on their return to improve their local system through increased resourcefulness. Through autonomy, mastery, and purpose international experiences may also inspire research involvement. 1. Robson S.

Review of primary school aged child mental health self-report outcome measures Nick Kowalenko1, Gordana Culjak1, Peter Brann2 Margaret Hoyland3, Margaret Jones3 and Rosemary Dickson3,4 1Discipline of Psychiatry, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; 2Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; 3The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Information Development Expert Advisory Panel (CAMHIDEAP), Parramatta, NSW, Australia; 4AMHOCN NSW Institute of Psychiatry, Sydney, Australia Background: The aim of this review is to investigate the utility, availability, and feasibility of mental health self-report outcome measures specifically for primary school aged children suitable for potential inclusion within the current Mental Health National Outcomes and Classification Collection. Objectives: The aims were to identify a range of measures suitable for children in the 5-11 age group and potentially suited for routine use as outcome measures. Methods: A literature review was conducted using a hierarchical criterion-based approach to assess whether given instruments might be suitable candidates. These criteria included age, child self-report, feasibility, social/emotional domains, availability for use in routine practice, sound psychometric properties, scientifically scrutinised, has continuity with other measures and is generalisable. Although there are many outcome measures that seem relevant to school-aged children; 94 were analysed in this review, many of them were broader in terms of age, often including adolescents. The pool of suitable measures narrowed considerably when seeking measures that could be completed by child self-report. Findings and conclusions: Analysing measures under the age criterion narrowed the pool to 53 potential measures, which was further narrowed considerably when focusing on those that could be completed by child self-report. This left 25 potential measures for analysis. Future work needs to focus on developing suitable measures or enhancing existing measures that focus on social, emotional, and behavioural domains, which are able to be completed by child self-report both easily and feasibly (5-10 min). They should also be made freely available to promote use and accessibility. Clever connections: using multiple aspects of carer-child attunement as entry points to healing following exposure to violence Katy Batha Heart Head Hand Newtown, Newtown, Australia Background: Exponential growth in our understandings of the effects of trauma on child development is filtering through to work in clinical settings. It is clear that finding ways to help both children and their carers develop improved neural regulation is a key factor. A whole-family pilot program run in 2014 (1) provided the opportunity to experiment with ways to positively influence aspects of carer-child attunement. Objectives: It was hoped that the success of the Clever Connections program would inform my clinical work with children and their carers, who had been exposed to the effects of domestic violence. Methods: Planning for sessions with carers included sharing information about the effects of trauma - both in relation to their own and the children's experiences - and collaboration for focus for five sessions. A range of games and fun activities were developed that could be shared with carers and their children in following sessions. These clustered around regulation, attunement, and languaging effects of experience. Findings and conclusions: Pre/post-testing using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire demonstrated improvements in functioning. Anecdotal reports from carers also suggested greater confidence in responding to caring challenges and a greater awareness of how their own neural states influenced their children's states.

Challenges in providing child and adolescent mental health services in Sri Lanka Kumudu Rathnayaka1, Rohitha Ranasinghe2, Sudarshi Senevirathne3, Gadambanathan Thanabalasingham4 and Chamari Mudalige5 1Hunter Area Mental Health, New Lambton, NSW, Australia; 2South West Healthcare, Warrnambool, Australia; 3Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka; 4Batticoloa General Hospital, Batticaloa, Sri Lanka; 5Mathara General Hospital, Matara, Sri Lanka Background: Sri Lanka has just three fully qualified child and adolescent psychiatrists for more than its 20-million population (1, 2). There are Child Guidance Clinics in almost every district, mainly managed by adult psychiatrists and trainees. War, natural disasters, displacement, and cultural pressures all cause significant impact on child mental health (3-5). Most children in need do not get adequate mental health care (6, 7). Objectives: To map child mental health services and explore the experience of psychiatrists with regard to the services they work for, their training, and life/work balance. Methods: We carried out a qualitative study using a semi-structured interview on service issues, training needs, and work/life balance with several psychiatrists from different parts of the country. We also incorporated a recent survey carried out by the Sri Lanka College of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists to map services and ascertain needs. Findings and conclusions: Psychiatrists involved in the qualitative study articulated the nature, issues related to their services, demands and challenges, steps they have taken to improve services, and how their work affects their personal lives. Most commented on the need for further training, especially on practical aspects and getting further support. They have few trained allied health staff. All reported having to go beyond their role, through training other staff, prevention, and community education and be innovative in getting support from different organisations. They found that the limited capacity of the services and logistical issues burden their professional and personal lives. However, most reported finding their work rewarding. 1.

Evaluation of a group-based drug and alcohol intervention in young offenders with mental disorder John Kasinathan1,2,3,4,5, Annie Parsons1 and Sarah Goodsell1 1Adolescent Unit, The Forensic Hospital, Justice Health, NSW Health, Sydney, Australia; 2School of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; 3Forensic Mental Health Service, ACT Health, Canberra, Australia; 4Centre for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia; 5The Level 8 Practice, Sydney, Australia Background: Many adolescents have co-occurring mental illness and substance use problems while under the care of the criminal justice system. While previous research has evaluated treatment programs for adult and adolescent offenders in general, there is a paucity of evidence for programs for young offenders with comorbid mental illness and substance use problems. Objectives: To evaluate a six-session, group-based drug and alcohol intervention offered to adolescent offenders hospitalised with mental disorder. Methods: A six-session, group-based drug and alcohol intervention was offered to adolescent offenders with mental disorder, hospitalised in the Adolescent Unit of the Forensic Hospital, Sydney. Pre- and post-intervention non-intrusive questionnaires and measures were collected: 1. Treatment Entry Questionnaire TEQ (1)]. 2. Drug-Related Locus of Control DRLOC (2)]. 3. Drug-Taking Confidence Questionnaire, short version DTCQ-8 (3)]. 4. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale BPRS (4)]. 5. Beck Youth Inventory 2nd edition BYI-II (5)]. Findings: Pre- and post-intervention measures were compared utilising paired t-tests with SPSS. Detailed results will be presented. Conclusions: Improved internal drivers for reducing substance use and improvement in mental health parameters, builds resilience in such vulnerable adolescents. Reduced substance use in young offenders with mental illness, benefits the youths themselves, their families, and the wider community. 1. Wild TC, Newton-Taylor B, Alletto R.

The complexities of consultation-liaison in perinatal and infant psychiatry - holding the line when it keeps being re-drawn. Cultural shame and exclusion in an African community turns to inclusion and acceptance for a young pregnant woman Rosalind Powrie and Liz Coventry Women's and Children's Health Network, Adelaide, Australia Background: This case presentation describes the story of an 18-year-old African woman who presents to a maternity hospital in secret, requesting a late termination and fearing violence from her family should she disclose this to them. The case highlights the role of consultation-liaison and decision-making processes between the perinatal and infant mental health team, maternity/obstetric team, social work, and child protective services. It also shows the importance of understanding how personhood and quality of life is defined in a cultural context, and how decisions about risks and benefits in pregnancy and medical/psychiatric care need to be considered through this lens. Objectives: To describe the role played by the perinatal and infant team in assisting obstetric and social work staff to find a solution to impasses and dilemmas in managing this young woman and her pregnancy. Key concerns include the patient's demands for early delivery, the risks and benefits in regard to both the infant and her own development, and her future life within her cultural community. Methods: A description of the events and management of this young woman's antenatal care will be given with particular focus on how decisions were made about her care and the care of her baby. Findings and conclusions: Outcomes are often unpredictable and surprising. In this case, it is worth reflecting on the work of the philosopher Emmanual Levinus who asks the question 'what is most at stake?' in the life of the patient. For this young woman, the answer seems to have been about belonging and inclusion. Yoga and child psychiatry Magella Lajoie1,2 1New South Wales Institute of Psychiatry, Sydney, Australia; 2Hunter New England Local Health District, Newcastle, Australia Background: Yoga has been a mental health discipline for millennia, originating in the Indus Valley. It has gained increasing popularity in Western societies since the early 20th century. Incorporation in mental health research and as a treatment modality has grown since the late 1970s. Objectives: Research has been primarily focused on adults with common mental health illnesses including insomnia, chronic pain, depression, and anxiety. Research has only recently turned their attention to the use of yoga in children and families. The objective of this presentation is to discuss contemporary research in the use of yoga in children and families with particular focus on yoga: 1. as adjunct treatment in the broader treatment plan of trauma-induced disorders in inpatient and outpatient populations; 2. as primary prevention, for example, its roll-out in primary and secondary schools in Massachusetts, USA. Methods: Classic yoga is briefly explained, including its relationship to meditation. Its evolution and adaptation to the west are discussed. Postulated modes of action have been proposed and will be outlined here. Clinical applications and preliminary research evidence will be outlined including the Yoga schools movement. Findings and conclusions: There has been growing evidence for yoga as adjunct therapy in adults. The evidence in children is limited, but there is a growing body of research in its application as adjunct therapy as well as playing a role in primary prevention as a tool for emotional regulation in school children. Another world: Internet games Huu Kim Le Northern Sydney Area Health Service, NSW Institute of Psychiatry, Sydney, Australia Background: In 2013, Internet gaming disorder (IGD) was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition for further research (1). Much of the literature on excessive Internet gaming originates from Asia, and further study is encouraged to determine if IGD should be added as a disorder (2). Starcevic (3) and King and Delfabbro (4) have debated on how to conceptualise and approach this problem clinically. Limited understanding of Internet games by clinicians may be secondary to being Internet game naïve. Internet games may seem so foreign; it is like entering another world. Objectives: This engaging presentation will offer clinicians a crash course on Internet games from a game design point of view (5). Clinicians will be able to combine their existing formulation skills, with game design concepts and dynamics to confidently understand why a child may be playing an Internet game excessively. Methods: Specific reference to recent Fellowship Investigation at ReLive, an Internet gaming addiction clinic for adolescents, at the National Addictions Management Service, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore. Including international collaboration with Internet Gaming Addiction Clinics in South Korea and India. Also search of motivations for play in Internet games, in relevant international journals (6) and collaboration with game designers. Conclusions: Excessive Internet gaming and addiction in children is reported around the world. Services in Asia have been set up to manage this concern. Children are no longer just playing Internet games; they are living in 'Internet worlds' created by game designers who have intimate knowledge of player psychology. By using internet gaming design concepts common to all game designers, this will help clinicians to formulate why a child may be presenting with excessive Internet gaming. 1.

A computer-assisted psycho-education program for hospitalized young adults with mental disorders: a naturalistic pilot study Gary Galambos1,2 1University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; 2Young Adult Mental Health Unit, St Vincent's Private Hospital, Sydney, Australia Background: The author developed a psycho-education program for use as a tool within his private practice at a 20-bed psychiatric hospital in Sydney dedicated to the management of young adults aged 16-25 years with mood, anxiety, psychotic, and personality disorders. The aim of the program was to complement and enhance face-to-face clinical treatment, to improve the patient's understanding of their psychopathology and treatment options, engagement, medication compliance, employment of psychological skills and strategies, and collaborative multidisciplinary care. Objectives: The aim of this presentation is to discuss 1) the development process, content, and technological features and 2) clinical utility of the tool. Methods: The development process took place over a 3-year period 'in the field' with feedback continuously sought from patients, families, psychiatry trainees, and allied health staff. This dynamic process of 'natural selection' enabled the author to regularly assess clinical utility and refine content in order to meet the tool's aims. Findings and conclusions: The novel attributes of the program developed were 1. sequential modules based on the priority treatment needs of inpatients using principles derived from evidence-based interventions; 2. practical models of health and psychopathology derived from neuroscience research, using simple metaphorical illustrations and jargon-free ordinary language; 3. an electronic delivery method with a graphical user interface to resonate with a computer-literate Generation Y's and to lay down the foundations for a personalized, 24/7 multi-platform resource for desktops, smartphones, and tablets enhancing accessibility to, and regularity of, treatment; and 4. an in-house education resource to facilitate the provision of consistency, cohesion, and containment by the multidisciplinary team. In general, feedback from all stakeholders was very positive, and minimal resistance was encountered. Using an electronic medium to deliver psycho-education allows the potential for the evolution to an online version that may also be an attractive and beneficial tool for clinicians to direct patients to use to complement individual care. Primary pain disorders in children and adolescents Paul Vroegop1,2 1Counties Manukau Health, Auckland, New Zealand; 2Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand Background: Most medical specialties have a functional disorder that appears to fall within their scope of practice. Such 'functional' pain syndromes include recurrent abdominal pain/irritable bowel syndrome, chronic daily headaches, generalized musculoskeletal pain, interstitial cystitis, and pelvic pain. These presentations can have a significant impact both on functioning and health care utilization. They are seen frequently in both primary care, paediatric outpatient and inpatient settings and CAMH services, and inconsistent understanding, and formulation of difficulties can make appropriate multidisciplinary well-coordinated management extremely challenging. Objectives: Review the critical distinction between acute and chronic pain, and discuss the concept of central sensitization and its relationship to chronic pain. Review the epidemiology of chronic pain syndromes, co-morbidity between different pain syndromes, and commonly associated comorbid symptom clusters such as hypermobility, POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), chronic fatigue, cognitive difficulties, anxiety, and depression. Methods: Review of the current literature around chronic pain presentations in children and young people, and treatment recommendations, and use of clinical case studies. Findings and conclusions: This presentation will review the evidence base for management for these young people and their family. We will discuss the critical importance of formulation and the use of language, in the process of engagement with young people and their families, and the impact of this engagement on treatment adherence. Lastly, we will expand the argument for promoting the specific term "Primary Pain Disorder" for these presentations. Gender dysphoria in the hunter Yolandie Goodyear Hunter New England Local Health District, Newcastle, Australia Background: Gender dysphoria (GD) refers to the feeling of unease between one's gender identity and genetic sex (1). It is a clinical problem with low incidence (2), but high morbidity and mortality (3). The presentations to mental health services of young people experiencing GD requiring diagnosis and care are increasing (3). There are gaps in services and, anecdotally, few Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists are confident in the assessment and treatment of young people with GD. Therefore, one of the first steps to address this health provision disparity is to present this topic to the Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists. Objectives: To outline the presentation of a 'typical' young person experiencing GD. To inform regarding the young person and family's concerns. To identify required services and service gaps. Methods: A case series will be presented outlining the assessment and formulation of five young people (ages 7, 15, 16, 16, 17) referred for review of GD/gender variant behaviour. Findings and conclusions: The presentation will highlight the need for skilled assessments and emphasize the struggle of many consumers in accessing services. 1. Hyde ZD.

Working with the ambulance chasers - the role of the child psychiatrist in civil litigation involving children Teresa Flower1,2 1Private Practice, Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia; 2Ashley Youth Detention Centre, Tasmania, Australia The assessment of children involved in civil litigation is an area often avoided by child psychiatrists. There is possibly a perception by the child psychiatrist that the complainants are being manipulated by 'ambulance chasing lawyers', and that such work is therefore distasteful. However, there is great variety in the cases who present for litigation and these might range from children whose parents have died through unforeseen medical events to children who allege bullying at school. In Australia, most assessment follows the guidelines established by the American Psychiatric Association. In Victoria, by law, assessment has to follow the GEPIC guidelines which were written solely from the adult perspective and are not well suited to assessing the needs of children in relation to a compensable injury. However, exactly what constitutes impairment in a child appears to be difficult for the courts to understand; for example, the question of a 'stable' injury in childhood would appear to conflict with a psychiatrist's understanding of the child's developmental trajectory where psychological problems wax and wane according to the particular demands of any phase in childhood and adolescence. This session will aim to look at the current concept of psychological injury as it relates to children and the role of the child psychiatrist in the assessment of injury, using case examples. DAY 3: Friday 2 October 2015 Brief, adolescent and parent-focused motivational enhancement interventions to reduce adolescent substance use Anthony Spirito Division of Clinical Psychology, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA The purpose of this presentation is to describe treatment research conducted over the last 15 years using brief, motivational enhancement therapy (MET) with substance abusing adolescents and their parents. The basic steps involved in both interventions will be described. The individual adolescent MET acknowledges choices and ambivalence, does not argue against resistance, reviews the pros and cons of substance use, and supports personal change goals rather than counsellor-based goals. The parent-focused MET, called the Family Check-up (FCU), targets specific family risk and protective factors linked to substance use and behaviour problems including parental supervision and monitoring, parent-teen relationship quality, and parental substance use. The presentation will review the results of MET interventions conducted with alcohol-abusing adolescents presenting to an Emergency Department, the use of both an individual adolescent MET and the FCU for truant, substance using adolescents, and preventive effects of the FCU with the siblings of substance abusing adolescents. Translational research in children and adolescents with externalising behavioural problems: aspects of treatment, neurobiology and predicting outcomes Background: Externalising behavioural problems are frequently seen in young patients with psychiatric disorders. Objectives: Aspects of outcome prediction, related treatment approaches by clinicians, and neurobiological aspects related to psychiatric disorders are crucial to clinicians and researchers with regard to a translational approach to target externalising symptoms in young people. Methods: The symposium will include presentations on identifying predictors of outcomes for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and testing-targeted interventions (Emma Sciberras), atypical antipsychotic prescribing patterns (a group of medications often used in young patients with externalising disorders) amongst Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services clinicians (Hayden Wilson), and neural correlates of reactive aggression in children with ADHD and comorbid disruptive behaviour disorders (Florian Daniel Zepf). Findings: Relevant findings of the outlined three areas covered (outcome prediction, preferences of clinicians, neurobiology of reactive aggressive behaviours in minors) will be presented and discussed in a translational context. Conclusions: Externalising behavioural problems such as reactive aggression in young people pose significant challenges for researchers and clinicians, and should be subject to future translational research projects. Identifying predictors of outcomes for children with ADHD and testing-targeted interventions Emma Sciberras1,2,3,4, Daryl Efron2,3,4 and Harriet Hiscock2,3,4 1School of Psychology, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia; 2Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia; 3The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia; 4Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia Background: Despite the availability of effective symptomatic treatments, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) continue to have poorer outcomes compared with their peers. One approach to improving outcomes is to develop interventions targeting factors associated with poorer functioning in children with ADHD, such as anxiety and sleep problems. Objectives: To examine whether treating anxiety and sleep problems in children with ADHD leads to improved functional outcomes. Methods: Two randomized controlled trials were conducted in children with ADHD, one examining the treatment of behavioural sleep problems (n=244, efficacy trial, two-session intervention) and the other focusing on the management of anxiety (n=12, pilot study, 10-session adapted cognitive behavioural therapy treatment). Both trials examined outcomes for the intervention group compared with usual clinical care. Children with diagnostically confirmed ADHD aged 5-13 years were recruited from paediatric practices across Victoria. Gold-standard outcomes were used to assess benefits including blinded diagnostic interviews with parents, parent and teacher reported outcome measures, and direct child assessment measures. Findings: In both trials, the intervention resulted in changes in the treatment target domain (e.g. anxiety and behavioural sleep problems) as well as broader functional outcomes including quality of life, ADHD symptom severity, and daily functioning. Moderate-large effect size differences were observed between the intervention group and the usual care group across most outcome domains. Conclusions: Systematically identifying and treating comorbidities in children with ADHD is one way of improving functional outcomes. This presentation will outline efforts to translate these findings into clinical practice. Atypical antipsychotic prescribing patterns amongst child and adolescent mental health services clinicians Hayden Wilson1, Florian Daniel Zepf2,3, IIndranil Chakrabarti4, Paul Sigalas5 and Pradeep Rao2,3,6 1Bentley Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAHMS), Child and Adolescent Health Service, Department of Health, Perth, Australia; 2Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, School of Psychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences & School of Paediatrics & Child Health, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia; 3Specialised Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), Child and Adolescent Health Service, Department of Health, Perth, Australia; 4Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom; 5Northern Deanery, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom; 6Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), Child and Adolescent Health Service, Department of Health, Perth, Australia Background: In the last decade, the prescription of atypical antipsychotics in minors, by all specialists, has increased. The use has been both licensed and 'off label', with the aim targeting different symptoms and clinical conditions. However, most research around safety and efficacy of these pharmacological agents has been conducted in adults and with repeated calls for such research in minors in vain. Objectives: This survey aims to describe current prescribing practices in a 'real-world' scenario and to compare the results with existing research to evaluate lessons learnt. Methods: The survey consisted of a semi-structured questionnaire that aimed to evaluate the current practices of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) prescribers. A total of 31 questionnaires sent out yielded 24 completed returns (77.41%). A literature search yielded articles that described prescribing trends over the last decade. The results from the survey were compared with the existing literature. Findings: The commonest indication for using atypical antipsychotics in minors was psychosis (75%). Other indications included reduced behavioural control (50%), tic disorders (37.5%), ADHD, and anxiety disorders. Atypical antipsychotics were the commonest first-line medications for managing behavioural control with risperidone (54%) being the most preferred agent. Second-line medications included quetiapine (7%) and olanzapine (15%). Doses were lower for managing behavioural control, and atypical antipsychotics were trialed for up to 8 weeks, and with duration of treatment extending up to 9 months. When such medications were used for non-psychotic presentations, most common target symptoms were aggression (85%), agitation (54%), and anxiety (54%). Most prescribers reported peer/expert opinion and their own clinical experience as evidence base for their use and clinical practice. Conclusions: In the investigated sample, atypical antipsychotics continue to be used as first-line medications for psychotic and non-psychotic psychiatric presentations in minors, despite an absence of clear evidence comparable to the adult literature, and also despite repeated calls for in-depth research in this particular population. Although the present survey was conducted amongst psychiatrists, this has implications for all prescribers in children and adolescents, regardless of their specialty. Neural correlates of reactive aggression in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid disruptive behaviour disorders Florian D. Zepf1,2,3,4,5, Beate Herpertz-Dahlmann1,3, Bojana Kuzmanovic6,7, Tilman J. Gaber1,3, Katrin Helmbold1,3, Markus G. Ullisch8,9, David Baurmann1,2,3, Simon B. Eickhoff10,11, Gereon R.

Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate underlying neural activity of reactive aggression in children with ADHD and comorbid DBD using functional neuroimaging techniques (fMRI). Methods: Eighteen boys with ADHD (aged 9-14 years, 10 subjects with comorbid DBD) and 18 healthy controls were administered a modified fMRI-based version of the 'Point Subtraction Aggression Game' to elicit reactive aggressive behaviour. Trials consisted of an 'aggression phase' (punishment for a fictitious opponent) and an 'outcome phase' (presentation of the trial outcome). Findings: During the aggression phase, higher aggressive responses of control children were accompanied by higher activation of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the temporoparietal junction. Patients displayed inverted results. During the outcome phase, comparison between groups and conditions showed differential activation in the dorsal striatum and bilateral insular when subjects gained points. Losing points was accompanied by differential activation of regions belonging to the insula and the middle temporal sulcus. Conclusions: Data support the hypothesis that deficient inhibitory control mechanisms are related to increased impulsive aggressive behaviour in ADHD and comorbid DBD. Unmasking childhood insanity: is there such a thing as a psychopathic child? A brief literature review and a case history Joey Le1,2,3 1The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney Children's Hospital Network, Sydney, Australia; 2Custodial Mental Health, Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network, Matraville, NSW, Australia; 3School of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Background: Psychopathy is a construct that has been subject to extensive debate in the psychiatric and psychological literature. Psychopathy is a complex bio-psycho-socio-cultural construct, and it is thought that some of its origins occur in childhood. Although disruptive behaviours commonly occur in children, only a small portion of children engage in behaviours sufficiently serious to be described as callous and unemotional. The presence of callous unemotional traits in a child with disruptive behaviour is thought to be a precursor to adult psychopathy. Objectives: The case presented is of a 5-year-old boy who lived in a permanent foster placement. His case demonstrates various aspects of the currently known literature on callous unemotionality, aggression, and psychopathy. Methods: Case history and focused literature review. Findings and conclusions: This presentation aims to highlight the importance of attachment theory in understanding disruptive behaviour, the role of prejudicial childhood on disruptive behaviour, problems with construct validity of conduct problems, antisociality, and psychopathy (esp. in childhood), and summarises the current understanding of genetic, neurobiological, and psychological theories explaining disruptive behaviour. Predictors of rapid re-incarceration in mentally ill young offenders John Kasinathan1,2,3,4,5 1Adolescent Unit, The Forensic Hospital, Justice Health, NSW Health, Sydney, Australia; 2School of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; 3Forensic Mental Health Service, ACT Health, Canberra, Australia; 4Centre for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia; 5The Level 8 Practice, Sydney, Australia Background: Adolescents in contact with the criminal justice system have high rates of re-offending. Youth in detention have high rates of mental disorder. However, there were no published reports on reincarceration predictors specifically for mentally ill youth. Objectives: To describe mentally ill youth released from custody, re-incarceration rates and predictors of rapid returns. Methods: Ambidirectional cohort study of 51 adolescent males with mental disorders released from the largest New South Wales Juvenile Justice Centre (2005-2007), a health-file audit at time of release and prospective determination of re-incarceration. Findings: Overall, 47% were Aboriginal, 43% originated from regional communities, substance disorders were highly prevalent, and only 12% accessed prior community mental health care. Over half (57%) satisfied diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorder. In custody, 39% were suicidal and 18% were homicidal. A majority (90%) returned to custody over a median of 28 months; half within 5 months of release. Schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder (p520,000), youthful, diverse multi-ethnic, and relatively socio-economically challenged population. It was the perception of the service that an increasing number of young people with high levels of distress and/or significant mental health issues were being referred after hours, and often seen by adult mental health crisis clinicians, with a loss of engagement during the handover process to CAMHS. Methods: We reviewed the current evidence around engagement with mental health treatment in children and young people, and the impact this has on outcomes. We undertook an audit of the time that young people presented to acute mental health services over a 6-month period, either via the community adult crisis services or via the hospital Emergency Department. Findings and conclusions: The author will discuss our audit findings, in light of the likely impact on engagement with young people and their families in acute mental health presentations, and the impact of this engagement on treatment adherence. Finally, we will discuss possible models for improving engagement with CAMHS treatment for young people presenting in crisis. An aide memoire to disposition of minors, following presentation to emergency department with mental health difficulties Klaus Martin Beckmann and Zena Hume School of Medicine, Griffith University, Nathan, Australia Background: Assessing and managing mental health issues in minors in the emergency department (ED) can be different from the management of adults. This may cause confusion to the newly recruited staff in an ED. Objectives: This paper aims to give a broad overview of some of the Commonwealth-based legal concepts which apply to minors with reference to basic medical standards such as good medical practice. Methods: Practice points are emphasised that apply to the management of minors which applies to many jurisdictions. Findings and conclusions: The aim is to give personnel commencing in ED a simplified but comprehensive overview. For out-of-hours, a template and aide memoire is given on how to clarify and streamline reflection on client management, disposition, and reduce potential confusion about the diverse legal frameworks that pertain to mental health care of minors. Shame and guilt and therapeutic concepts Klaus Martin Beckmann School of Medicine, Griffith University, Nathan, Australia Background: Shame and guilt are concepts going back to antiquity. Objectives: Track shame and guilt over the centuries and link these old concepts to modern psychological interventions. Methods: Use existing reviews on shame and guilt, and synthesize these old concepts with summaries on modern therapeutic models. Findings and conclusions: Shame and guilt are basic concepts, which continue to play a role into the modern age. Anti-NMDA encephalitis in an African adolescent with congenital HIV: a case report Scott Newman1, Klaus Martin Beckmann2 and Peter Parry3 1Logan Hospital, Meadowbrook, Australia; 2Logan Hospital, Meadowbrook, Australia; 3Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia Background: A recently settled 13-year-old African male with congenital HIV presented with first episode psychosis that was subsequently diagnosed with anti-NMDA encephalitis. Objectives: A clinical case is described to highlight presenting features of anti-NMDA encephalitis and complicating factors including language, culture, past trauma. A discussion follows on the potential contributing role of abnormal immune functioning in anti-NMDA encephalitis in a patient with congenital HIV. Methods: The case is presented with an outline of history, management, and subsequent progress. Guardian's, and within its limitations the patient's, consent to present this case have been provided. Findings and conclusions: A young male patient with anti-NMDA encephalitis and congenital HIV was treated with multiple subspecialty medical and psychiatric input, achieving full remission and remains well at the point of submission to this conference.},

abstract={Issue Title: Advances in Mobile Networking: Wearable Systems and Novel Management Solutions This paper presents a scalable prototype surveillance/alarm system for public transportation safety applications over railway environments with emphasis given in the wireless vehicular communication inside a tunnel after an emergency event. An heterogeneous hybrid vehicular wireless network consisted of IEEE 802.11b/g/e and IEEE 802.16e is being deployed inside a tunnel environment for surveillance reasons. We provide a highly modular architecture system design covering a wide range of applications both in terms of monitored spaces (metro stations, trains, buses and other public transport) and in terms of threats to public safety (security incidents, accidental events, natural hazards) based on autonomous, smart monitoring devices that capture data only upon the occurrence of an incident, potentially dangerous for the passengers (like an explosion blast or the triggering of the fire detector). Moreover, we evaluate the experimental performance of the proposed vehicular hybrid WiMAX/WLAN wireless network after an emergency situation, for this reason we emulate the train coaches movement with vehicles inside a tunnel field. Finally, we also survey on the impact of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) over the hybrid wireless network comparing the experimental results.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Beyond that, not much was expected from clients. The clinical model of recovery is still based on the same criteria: treatment adherence, symptom reduction, restoration of function (sometimes an attempt at cognitive rehabilitation is incorporated into the clinical model), and staying out of hospital. It emphasises the view from the outside, i.e. the clinician’s assessment, rather than taking the patient’s subjective view into account.2 It was not until 2005, after the report by the 2003 President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, that mental health professionals began to consider the necessity of changing their view on recovery.3 In December 2011, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defined recovery as “A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential.”4 In this article, I will be using my own case history, a Chinese female immigrant to Canada, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, to illustrate the process of recovery. I will show the limitations of the clinical model of recovery, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the empowerment model of recovery, thus, reinforcing the SAMHSA definition. Every country has its own mental health system. The procedures differ and mental health legislation may vary. But the experience of illness and recovery that I encountered as an immigrant to Canada are in many ways universal, shared by survivors of different races and cultural backgrounds living in different parts of the world. I hope that my first-person narrative will prove helpful to mental health professionals in treatment of their psychiatric clients. My Illness My first episode occurred in 1973 when I was 21 years old, after my return to Hong Kong from studying at the University of Minnesota, and after travelling on my own for 2 months in Europe. I had had a fight with my boyfriend and was upset. A doctor at The University of Hong Kong medical clinic prescribed some pills, and I was able to sleep and concentrate on my studies. However, not knowing much about illness or medication, my mother snatched away the pills and would not let me take them. After that, I could not sleep; I frequently lost my temper and yelled at my parents in English (which they could not understand). My mother called a psychiatrist. Against my will, I was sent to the psychiatric ward of a general hospital and was cared for by private nurses during a 2-week observation period. My telephone line was cut. My only visitors were my boyfriend, my parents, and my nanny. My mother told my high school friends that I was fine and not to visit me. The psychiatrist diagnosed me as having an “acute hysterical reaction” in response to my life situation. I was not taking any medication when I emigrated to Toronto in 1974. As a new immigrant, I had to retrain myself as a teacher by taking a Bachelor of Education degree at the University of Toronto in order to get the “Canadian experience” to be hired as a full-time teacher with the Toronto District School Board. While working, I upgraded myself by obtaining a Master of Education degree from the same university. My husband (my former boyfriend) and I lived with my parents for whom I had to translate because they did not speak much English. I did not realise the emotional stress caused by all these cultural adjustments. At that point, I had no real close friends in Toronto either. My next episode occurred in 1980 after a long flight from Hong Kong and several sleepless nights of turmoil between my husband and myself. I did not know anything about the mental health system, the different admission criteria, and patients’ rights in Canada. Because I was emotionally upset, I went to the emergency department of a local hospital right after landing in Toronto and was examined by a western psychiatrist. There are cultural differences between easterners and westerners that are sometimes hard to bridge in psychiatric assessment, especially, when the client is agitated and disturbed.5 Out of fear, in a totally strange medical environment, I mumbled in English. All of a sudden, my English became jerky and I had difficulty expressing my emotions. I was probably hard to understand. I was asked to name 5 Canadian Prime Ministers (as a new immigrant, I could not think of any), read aloud an article from Time Magazine, and explain an English proverb — a total mystery to me. The psychiatrist gave me a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium, methotrimeprazine, sodium amytal, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine. He did not explain why or how he reached that diagnosis. He wrote in my file (which I later saw), “behaviour remains very active and uncooperative and demanding.” In his opinion, I apparently had a good relationship with my parents, and my husband was extremely tolerant and supportive. Even though I stayed in the inpatient ward for 3 months, no one noticed that I was extremely unhappy in my marriage. I divorced my husband in 1982. My next major episode occurred in 1992 when a new romantic relationship ended abruptly. I was hospitalised and treated with a combination of medications. My father had recently died. After my discharge, my mother suddenly disappeared from the house that we shared and none of my relatives would tell me where she was. Her disappearance, perhaps, had to do with the fact that she could not bear the shame of her beloved daughter suffering from a mental illness, but more so, perhaps, because of the burden of caregiving that now fell on her shoulders. She had little knowledge about mental illness, few coping skills, and no support from professionals in the hospital. She must have felt helpless, living in a foreign environment with limited English and hearing only misinformation about my condition provided by my brother and his wife. This complete lack of familial support made me feel alienated, socially excluded, guilt-ridden, and totally demoralised. I felt as if I were a second-class citizen, the black sheep of the family. I used to make long distance calls to my high school friends from Ying Wa Girls’ School, and to my aunt and uncle in Hong Kong for emotional support and understanding. It was only after a family friend accidentally bumped into my mother on the street that I learnt that she was alive, and we were reunited. Until today, although my mother has passed away, my brother and his wife never discuss the topic of my illness. To them, mental illness is a taboo subject that must be avoided. This experience underscores the importance of family support in recovery. It also makes me advocate for provision of psychosocial education to families to promote better understanding of mental health and to de-stigmatise mental illness. In 1999, I was in a coma and had to stay in the intensive care unit for 2 weeks after receiving a combination of neuroleptic medications to calm, what the doctor considered to be, my manic state. A tracheotomy had to be performed so that I could breathe; I still bear that scar on my throat. Limitations of the Clinical Model in My Recovery Between hospitalisations, I would have been described as clinically recovered. I took my medications (lithium, perphenazine, trihexyphenidyl, triazolam) and, thanks to them, I had no symptoms (“no disturbance of mood,” my family physician wrote in his report to the psychiatrist), and I functioned pretty well (teaching full time). During my hospital stays, obedience and conformity to hospital rules were expected. As long as I did what I was told, I was considered “recovered” enough to leave the hospital. Mental health professionals seemed to be only interested in my illness, not in me as a person. They did not seem to notice that I came from a different culture to theirs, that I communicated verbally and non-verbally in a way that was different from theirs, and that my tolerance to medications was different from that of an ‘average’ Canadian’s. Lu6 points out that there are pharmacokinetic differences between Asians and Caucasians, and that “therapeutic dosages are more likely to need considerable adjustment for some ethnic groups such as Asians and Native American people, in contrast to Caucasian groups.” Those who did notice that I was Chinese seemed to think I should comply with the stereotypes of Chinese women: be quiet, submissive, dependent. When I did not fit the stereotype, they gave me more medications. No one noticed that I had lost my passion for concerts and stage plays. No one noticed because no one asked about that. I was no longer motivated to write short stories, as I had done before. I lost my knack for playing the piano. I could no longer think critically. I just listened to other people and did as I was told. The independence and the freedom that I had so enjoyed when I was younger were no longer there. I complained about side-effects of lithium (hand tremor, extreme thirst, skin pigmentation, weight gain) but none of the mental health professionals I spoke to took these seriously. I was not taken seriously by my friends or relatives in Toronto either. They ridiculed me as a “mental invalid.” Asians are not very kind when it comes to mental illness. In Free to fly: a story of manic depression,7 I wrote about myself: “A hopeless nut. That was me alright. Dependent on my ageing parents. Misunderstood by friends. Misjudged by relatives. Confidence lost. Self-esteem low. A living corpse with a mental handicap.” My Eventual Recovery I did, however, recover fully, eventually. Besides psycho- logical supportive therapy and the right medications, the following are the fundamental elements of my recovery: learning self-care techniques, regaining forgotten dreams, restoring confidence, rebuilding hope, renewed social inclusion, spiritual connections, and leading a life with meaning and purpose. Understanding my medications and how they work has been a vital self-care technique for me. After the coma, my medications were changed to 1 mg of lorazepam at night and 600 mg of valproic acid daily. With the right dose, there were no adverse side-effects of these medications. I now take an active interest in knowing about different kinds of psychoactive medications and their side-effects. I discuss this in detail with my psychiatrist. I read about the medications and I look up their side-effects on the internet. My hands no longer tremble and my skin is clear. I do not have to drink water every few minutes. I am down to a size 7 instead of the size 16 that I became when I was taking lithium. I get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night without interruption and do not even suffer jetlag on long-haul flights. I attribute this to having become knowledgeable about medications and holding out for what I know I need or do not need. I am now aware of my triggers and early warning signs. I realise now that my episodes were mainly caused by a lack of emotional intelligence on my part in terms of interpersonal relationships, not understanding the role of stress in my life, and not appreciating the importance of adequate sleep. I have learned to better handle interpersonal relationships and improve my emotional intelligence by reading Albert Ellis’s Rational emotive behavior therapy.8 “Take life easy” has become my motto. With 1 mg of lorazepam, I make sure that I sleep so that I can function well the next day. Awareness of my triggers has helped me to prevent relapses. I pay attention to nutrition and exercise. I have learned to eat a balanced diet with vegetables and protein (fish and lean meat). I also take omega 3 fatty acids which have been shown to help in stabilising one’s mood.9,10 Now, I also read the labels on each product. I go to the gym for workouts as often as I can, aiming at 150 minutes per week. Research demonstrates that adequate amount of exercise helps to decrease depressive symptoms.11 I had always wanted to be a writer, speaker, and lecturer. Yet, when I would mention this to health care pro- fessionals, they saw it as “grandiose thoughts”. I was never encouraged. In fact, my aspirations were actively discouraged; they were seen as part of my illness. Nonetheless, I have now regained my dreams and rebuilt my hope due to a number of factors. Most importantly, people I respect believe in me. Ahern and Fisher12 have pointed out that this is, indeed, an important element of recovery. My current psychiatrist understands my aspirations and encourages me to achieve them. Personal goals, whether or not one is able to attain them, are crucial to recovery.13-15 Encouraged by an elderly friend, I attended a creative writing course at Yale University and this was a major turning point. My professor, Dr Richard Selzer, motivated and supported me. He believed that I was a good writer. I have since written a book about my illness (both in English and in Chinese) and my recovery. I have also published articles in psychiatric journals.16,17 Professionals with whom I have worked on panels, conferences, workshops, and educational enterprises have believed in me and my abilities. My confidence has been restored. Since 2001, I have been working as an ESL (English as a second language) / literacy teacher for immigrant psychiatric survivors at a Toronto centre. Helping those who are in the same boat as I provides me with a sense of usefulness. For a survivor to become a service provider is a big step and it makes me feel valued. In 2001, I was a recipient of the Courage to Come Back Awards sponsored by The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. I spoke in front of 900 mental health professionals, which convinced me that I could present my experience to large audiences. In 2007, I was asked to be a plenary speaker at the World Federation for Mental Health Congress in Hong Kong where I spoke to 1000 international delegates about combating social stigma towards mental illness and promoting the fact that recovery is possible. Since then, I have given many talks and presented several workshops to mental health professionals and survivors in Asia and North America, not only on recovery, but also on immigrant mental health, cultural competence, and women’s mental health. Exposure to survivors and professionals of various cultures makes me realise that mental illness can strike anyone, regardless of race, culture, age, class, intellectual, or education level. This has changed my previous conviction that I was alone with my bipolar disorder. I now realise that mental illness, especially mood disorder, is widely prevalent. The readers of my book, the Chinese readers in particular, have taken the initiative to contact me and consult with me about their mental well-being and that of their loved ones. This response is encouraging for me, especially since Chinese people, in general, are quite reluctant to talk about mental health issues. This gives me a sense of purpose and meaning, a well-described element of recovery.15,18 My social circle has been revitalised. I have reconnected with old friends from high school and I have made new friends among the survivors, nurses, social workers, professors, and physicians whom I have met more recently. This is an important key to recovery.19 My friends provide me with social support no matter where they live; this is easier now by universal access to email. The fact that I can rely on them for support and understanding when needed is vital for my recovery.20 I am no longer socially excluded. During my hospitalisations, I prayed to God for comfort and strength and promised that, if only I would recover, I would build a bridge between mental health professionals and clients. Since recovering from my coma, I thank God every day for my life. I find peace and comfort through my prayers. Recently, I have been asked to speak at a Chinese church in Toronto where I will share my experience of God’s blessings. Implications for Mental Health Professionals The personal narrative of my recovery from bipolar disorder illustrates, I believe, the limitations of the traditional clinical model of recovery. Remission of symptoms and return to work are not sufficient. I needed to regain my dreams, renew my hope, reconnect with friends, enlarge my social circle, and develop confidence in myself and my abilities. I needed people to believe in me. I needed to re-establish my spiritual connection with God and I needed my life to have a purpose. I needed to feel useful. These are principles of the empowerment model of recovery which mental health professionals should know how to introduce into the care of mentally ill clients. Paying attention to issues of gender and culture is also important for clients. Individualised care has always been the province of mental health professionals and the empowerment model of recovery epitomises, in my mind, the essence of personal care.

abstract={Addressing a gap in the current work-life balance (WLB) literature regarding individual-focused approaches to inform interventions, we elicited behaviors used to self-manage WLB to draw up a competency-based WLB framework for relevant learnable knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA; Hoffmann, Eur J Ind Train 23:275-285, 1999 ) and mapping this against extant WLB frameworks. Our participants were from a major UK police force, which faces particular challenges to the work-life interface through job demands and organizational cutbacks, covering a range of operational job roles, including uniformed officers and civilian staff. We took a mixed methods approach starting with semi-structured interviews to elicit 134 distinct behaviors (n = 20) and used a subsequent card sort task (n = 10) to group these into categories into 12 behavioral themes; and finally undertook an online survey (n = 356) for an initial validation. Item and content analysis reduced the behaviors to 58, which we analyzed further. A framework of eight competencies fits the data best; covering a range of strategies, including Boundary Management, Managing Flexibility, and Managing Expectations. The WLB self-management KSAs elicited consist of a range of solution-focused behaviors and strategies, which could inform future WLB-focused interventions, showing how individuals may negotiate borders effectively in a specific environment. A competence-based approach to WLB self-management is new, and may extend existing frameworks such as Border Theory, highlighting a proactive and solution-focused element of effective behaviors.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Doc number: 209 Abstract Background: One in 4500 children is born with ambiguous genitalia, milder phenotypes occur in one in 300 newborns. Conventional time-consuming hormonal and genetic work-up provides a genetic diagnosis in around 20-40% of 46,XY cases with ambiguous genitalia. All others remain without a definitive diagnosis. The investigation of milder cases, as suggested by recent reports remains controversial. Methods: Integrated clinical, hormonal and genetic screening was performed in a sequential series of 46, XY children, sex-assigned male, who were referred to our pediatric endocrine service for atypical genitalia (2007-2013). Results: A consecutive cohort of undervirilized 46,XY children with external masculinization score (EMS) 2-12, was extensively investigated. In four patients, a clinical diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome or Mowat-Wilson syndrome was made and genetically supported in 2/3 and 1/1 cases respectively. Hormonal data were suggestive of a (dihydro)testosterone biosynthesis disorder in four cases, however no HSD17B3 or SRD5A2 mutations were found. Array-CGH revealed a causal structural variation in 2/6 syndromic patients. In addition, three novel NR5A1 mutations were found in non-syndromic patients. Interestingly, one mutation was present in a fertile male, underlining the inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability of NR5A1 -associated phenotypes. No AR , SRY or WT1 mutations were identified. Conclusion: Overall, a genetic diagnosis could be established in 19% of non-syndromic and 33% of syndromic cases. There is no difference in diagnostic yield between patients with more or less pronounced phenotypes, as expressed by the external masculinisation score (EMS). The clinical utility of array-CGH is high in syndromic cases. Finally, a sequential gene-by-gene approach is time-consuming, expensive and inefficient. Given the low yield and high expense of Sanger sequencing, we anticipate that massively parallel sequencing of gene panels and whole exome sequencing hold promise for genetic diagnosis of 46,XY DSD boys with an undervirilized phenotype.},

The solved cases that led to the caught of some criminals in this wealthy business revealed that many public workers that have competency in the domain (R.AR, policemen, border police) are strongly involved and have tight bounds with the criminal groups.

abstract={Fine, cohesive sediment suspensions are a common feature of estuarine environments. Generally, multilayer models are used to describe the vertical distribution of such sediments. Such conceptional models normally distinguish at least high suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) as a topmost layer and a consolidated bed layer, often including an intermediate, fluid mud layer. Rheological, and in particular sedimentological properties are rarely included in these models. New data from two different estuaries provide new insights that can contribute toward the classification of near- bed cohesive sediments. The water-solid bed interfaces within the turbidity maximum zones of the Weser and Ems estuaries were sampled with 2-4-m-long cores. At 10-cm intervals, values of SSC, viscosity, particulate organic matter, mud : sand ratio, temperature, salinity, and grain-size distributions were determined. By normalizing these parameters to SSC and performing a cluster analysis, sediment suspensions of <20 g/L SSC, fluid mud with up to 500 g/L SSC, and an underlying cohesive/consolidated bed can each clearly be distinguished. However, changes in flow behaviour and sedimentological characteristics represented by a shift in the cluster grouping support a subdivision of the fluid mud into a low-viscosity (I) (20-200 g/L SSC) and a high-viscosity (II) (200-500 g/L SSC) layer. Furthermore, by normalizing SSC measurements, site-specific differences were observed in the rheological behaviour of the fluid mud which might be caused by differences in grain-size composition. This suggests that the widely accepted 3-layer model of vertical SSC profiles should be extended by two layers of fluid mud identified in this study. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Abstract Objective The automated external defibrillator (AED) is a tool that contributes to survival with mixed outcomes. This review assesses the effectiveness of the AED, consistencies and variations among studies, and how varying outcomes can be resolved. Methods A worksheet for the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 2010 science review focused on hospital survival in AED programs was the foundation of the articles reviewed. Articles identified in the search covering a broader range of topics were added. All articles were read by at least two authors; consensus discussions resolved differences. Results AED use developed sequentially. Use of AEDs by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) compared to manual defibrillators showed equal or superior survival. AED use was extended to trained responders likely to be near victims, such as fire/rescue, police, airline attendants, and casino security guards, with improvement in all venues but not all programs. Broad public access initiatives demonstrated increased survival despite low rates of AED use. Home AED programs have not improved survival; in-hospital trials have had mixed results. Successful programs have placed devices in high-risk sites, maintained the AEDs, recruited a team with a duty to respond, and conducted ongoing assessment of the program. Conclusion The AED can affect survival among patients with sudden ventricular fibrillation (VF). Components of AED programs that affect outcome include the operator, location, the emergency response system, ongoing maintenance and evaluation. Comparing outcomes is complicated by variations in definitions of populations and variables. The effect of AEDs on individuals can be dramatic, but the effect on populations is limited.

abstract={A decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany states that negative pressure wound therapy is not accepted as a standard therapy with full reimbursement by the health insurance companies in Germany. This decision is based on the rapid report and the final report of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, which demonstrated through systematic reviews and meta-analysis of previous studies projects that an insufficient state of evidence regarding the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for treatment of acute and chronic wounds exists. The Institute for Research in Operative Medicine (IFOM) as part of the University of Witten / Herdecke gGmbH is an independent scientific institute that is responsible for the planning, implementation, analysis and publication of trial projects regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy for acute and chronic wounds in both medical sectors (in- and outpatient care) in Germany. The study projects are designed and conducted with the aim to provide solid evidence regarding the efficacy of NPWT. The trials evaluate the treatment outcome of the application of a technical medical device which is based on the principle of negative pressure wound therapy (Intervention Group) in comparison to standard wound therapy (Control group) in the treatment of chronic foot wounds and acute subcutaneous abdominal wounds after surgery. All used treatment systems bear the CE mark and will be used within normal conditions of clinical routine and according to manufacturer's instructions. The aim of the trial projects is to compare the clinical, safety and economic results of both treatment arms. Study results will be provided until the end of 2014 to contribute to the final decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany regarding the general admission of negative pressure wound therapy as a standard of performance within both medical sectors. Introduction: Adequate patient recruitment is a key condition determining the validity, duration and costs of RCTs, yet remains challenging. The expanding interface between therapeutic endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of benign gastrointestinal diseases demands RCTs to compare safety and cost-effectiveness of comparable interventions. We aimed to identify patient motives and barriers for (non)participation in the TREND study. Methods: Patients with large rectal adenomas counseled between January and July 2011 for participation in an RCT comparing endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) were invited for a semi-structured interview (14 participants, 12 non- participants). Interviewees were asked to discuss their main motive for (non-) participation in an open fashion. Subsequently, potential other barriers and motivations as previously described in the literature were presented by the interviewer. Interviews were coded and analyzed by 2 independent researchers. Results: We interviewed 10 participants and 7 non-participants, aged 54-84. Key motive for trial participation was contribution to medical science and future clinical practice (all participants). Other motives included satisfactory counseling, sufficient time to reflect and the sense that participation was completely voluntary. The vast majority of non-participants had previous in-hospital experience, however more than half had not been introduced to research prior. Although most non-participants felt contributing to research was important, key barriers to participation included a distinct preference for either EMR (n=4) or TEM (n=3) or intervention-specific characteristics like type of sedation (all non-participants). Consultation of family members affected half of all decisions. Study characteristics such as randomization, blinding, insurance and ethical approval hardly influenced the decision making. Conclusion: In RCTs comparing similar endoscopic and surgical strategies, thorough, tailored and timely counseling is crucial to clarify the study purpose and to emphasize the presumed equality of allocation arms. Avoidance of common barriers to participation will improve trial inclusion. The establishment of clinical trial centers creates a demand for both infrastructure and skilled staff. While establishment and operation of clinical trial centers in surgical specialties have in recent years often been conducted by medical staff in addition to clinical practice, the intensification of legal regulations and the increased number of clinical trials in surgery requires rethinking. The ability to fulfill these more specialized demands can only be given by allocating sufficient funds. These funds can be used to employ trained paramedical staff and furthermore to release medical staff from clinical work and thereby enable full-time scientific work. On the other hand, a demand for funding is risen to implement infrastructural requirements such as IT hardware and premises. Once a clinical trial center has been established, further operation has to be ensured by generating additional funds. While the demand for start-up financing of a clinical trial unit is most meaningful arranged by governmental or institutional fundraising, the operation relies on generating sufficient funds through the conduction of industry-initiated trials. Own experience and further possibilities are demonstrated by reporting on different strategies for funding of clinical trial centers and the general demand of funds during establishment and operation of clinical trial centers. Therefore, different governmental, industrial as well as institutional supports are relevant factors. In Europe safety management requirements in clinical trials with medical devices were changed fundamentally by the council directive 2007/47/EC in 2007 and internationally with the ISO 14155:2011 in 2011. Previously adverse incidents had to be reported to the competent authority. Since implementation of the directive in Germany each serious adverse event (SAE) which happened or might have happened to a patient, user, or third party, must be reported immediately. Sponsor and investigators must report SAEs via an electronic form centrally provided by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Besides profound knowledge adequate IT equipment at all investigator trial sites are needed. The latter being a challenge for academic trials with their low budgets. To develop operational competence the quality management (QM) working group of the Clinical Trials Centers (CTC)-network developed a harmonized SOP describing thecomplex procedures of safety management for sponsor and investigator trial sites. It includes appendices providing among others definitions, a template for an SAE-manual, and instructions for completing the electronic form. This document particularly suggests solutions regarding more general regulatory requirements,e.g. follow-up information for the sponsor or for the competent authority. The implemented safety management procedures consider experiences derived from clinical trials with medicinal products and the special characteristics of academic trials. As increased numbers of clinical trials with medical devices are to be expected according to changed regulations CTCs will become more experienced with these complex procedures. Thus they will be competent partners to industry in conducting national and international clinical trials with medical devices. Our report will show the challenges of coping with this novel electronic reporting process, and provide our experiences in fulfilling the updated changed German national regulations. Due to the ever increasing global activity in clinical research, knowledge transfer between researchers and all stakeholders in clinical health care (including patients) worldwide is an indispensable requirement. A prerequisite for knowledge transfer in clinical research is an unbiased and complete view on clinical trial results. How is the arising number of clinical trials registries and results databases being utilized by different user groups including ethics committees, clinicians, patients, researchers, reimbursement and funding institutions? What are the different requirements defined by the parties involved? How can variable needs be met? What seem to be the arising issues concerning database content, language barriers, retrieval problems, implementation of knowledge into daily work, evaluation of existing evidence? What efforts are made to overcome the obstacles? Meanwhile it is daily experience that conduct of a clinical quality assurance audit involves some kind of computer system to be considered and assessed. The following fundamental question comes immediately to mind: how valid are data and information kept and handled by the systems employed? This question will be subdivided in five parts for the purpose of this session: Where does the basic computer system used come from, how has it been implemented and validated and how is it maintained? How has the computer system application used in a specific trial been developed, validated and deployed and how is it operated and maintained? Which regulations, guidelines and state of the art standards are to be expected to be observed for development, validation and operation? How big are the risks on data quality and acceptability of the study outcome in case of malfunction of the computer system application? How high are chances that system weaknesses can be detected in a standard audit setting and how can auditors optimise the preparation and conduct of their review to detect hidden system bugs? The session presents an overview over the current situation, naming specific risks and gives some answers to the questions posed afore, mainly by giving practical examples how to proceed in the most frequent audit situations, namely investigator site audits (eClinical and electronic source documents), CRO system audits and vendor audits. A flexible and simple Bayesian decision- theoretic design for dose finding trials is proposed in this paper. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we adopt a working model which produces analytic posterior distributions. In addition, this working model is sufficiently flexible to fit all monotonic dose-toxicity curves. We also discuss how to use a proper utility function to reflect the interest of the trial. Patients are allocated based on not only the utility function but also the chosen dose selection rule. The most popular dose selection rule is the one-step-look-ahead (OSLA), which selects the best so far dose. More complicated rules such as two-step-look- ahead (TSLA) are surely more efficient than OSLA only when the required distributional assumptions are met which is however often not the case in practice. We carry out extensive simulation studies to evaluate a variety of dose selection rules and have found that OSLA is often more efficient than TSLA under our proposed method. Moreover, our simulation results show that the proposed method performs superior to several popular Bayesian methods and the negative impact of prior mis-specification could be considered in the design stage. Isotonic Design using Normalized Equivalent Toxicity Score (ID-NETS) is a novel Phase I design originally proposed by Chen et al. by integrating the novel toxicity scoring system proposed by Chen et al. and the original Isotonic Design proposed by Leung et al. ID-NETS has substantially improved the accuracy of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation and efficiency of trial by fully utilizing all toxicities of each patient and treating toxicity response as a quasi-continuous variable instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in a Phase I clinical trial. To facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with ID-NETS, we have developed a user-friendly software ID-NETS©TM, which has two functions: 1) Calculating the recommended next dose level from completed data; and 2) Performing simulation to obtain the operating characteristics of a trial. Currently, ID-NETS©TM v1.0 is available for download at http://winshipbbisr.emory.edu/IDNETS.html. Building on the toxicity probability interval (TPI) design in Ji et al. (2007), we present a modified TPI design (mTPI) that is calibration-free for phase I trials. Our goal is to further simplify the design and improve the trial conduct, and provide more effective and safer methods while maintaining the simplicity of the original TPI design. Like the TPI method, mTPI consists of a practical dose-finding scheme guided by the posterior inference using a simple Bayesian model. However, the new method benefits from improved dose-finding decision rules based on a new statistic, the unit probability mass (UPM). The improvement through the use of the UPM for dose finding is significant. We will present extensive simulation results comparing the mTPI design to the 3+3 and CRM methods, and provide convincing evidence why the mTPI is a practically superior method. Among the most recent advances in escalation with overdose control (EWOC) based Bayesian adaptive phase I clinical trial designs, Tighiouart et al (2011) developed EWOC based on the proportional hazards model (EWOC-PH) using time to toxicity to estimate the MTD. The method has been shown to be more efficient to estimate MTD comparing to the original EWOC and a version of time to event EWOC (TITE-EWOC) proposed by Mauguen et al (2010). In this study, we will further extent EWOC-PH to take into account patients' baseline covariates. The extension of EWOC to accommodate baseline covariates has been developed by Babb and Rogatko (2001) and Tighiouart and Rogatko (2010). We expect that the new design will provide better safety protection by assigning a personalized dose to the next available patient based on his/her own baseline characteristics and lead to an estimation for covariate specific phase II dose. We assess the operating characteristics for the design via extensive simulations including three scenarios: (1) design using a covariate; (2) Design ignoring the covariate; (3) Design using separate trials. The efficiency of estimating the conditional MTD and safety of the trial are compared with original EWOC with covariate using DLT as a binary indicator of toxicity. Escalation with overdose control (EWOC) is a successful Phase I design and has been widely used. Chen et al. further extended EWOC to utilize fully all toxicities of patients instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) by incorporating the normalized toxicity scoring system (NETS) proposed by Chen et al. into EWOC with a quasi-Bernoulli likelihood approach. The new design is called EWOC-NETS which has been demonstrated by simulation studies to have good operating characteristics and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation relative to common Phase I designs. In this study, we have developed an interactive software called EWOC-NETS©TM which is very user friendly to facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with EWOC-NETS and available for free download at the website of Emory University http://winshipbbisr.emory.edu/Software.html. We would like to introduce this novel statistical software and translate EWOC-NETS into Phase I cancer clinical trials in the future. Some clinical predictors may or may not have monotonic properties. They may have increasing or decreasing pattern or they may remain steady during a period of observation time. A clinical question is raised on how such increasing or decreasing or constant pattern of variations may have effect on survival or on clinical outcomes independently during a period of time. Generally we ignore such point of transitions and independent pattern of variations while investigating their overall effect. Isotonicity is called the simple or partial ordered monotonicity mathematically. Isotonic regression is performed under ordered monotonic restrictions criteria. Either increasing or decreasing or constant variation of a clinical predicator or of a prognostic variable generates a change-point problem at the transition from increasing order to decreasing order or vice versa or from the steady condition to either increasing or decreasing pattern of clinical predictors. The primary thrust of this paper is to address such clinical questions using a Cox Regression Model with isotonic regressors with such change-point problems. In a case study with multiple myeloma the impact of such change- point patterns of clinically significant predictors such as hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, white blood corpuscles, platelets on patients median survival time have been explored. Policy makers in Denmark are starting to realize that RCT designs are needed if they want to know the impact of social interventions. Therefore the Ministry of Social Affair granted funding to do three RCTs of family programs (Multidimension Treatment Foster Care-MTFC, Parent Management Training Oregon -PMTO and Multisystemic Therapy-MST). During the last year SFI has been planning the studies including all relevant parts in the process. The process has been long and challenging. Problems faced include: 1: A pronounced resistance to randomization within all levels of social services. 2: An economic crisis in the municipalities causing both unwillingness to participate in the research study and a significant lower caseload in the MST and MTFC teams. 3: Fear of the study going to steal half of the families from the programs. 4: Underfunding of the studies. 5: Resistance against using standardized tests because this is not common in social work, and 6: Difficulties in getting data for power calculations. Recurring issues that we have had to deal with are: "do we really have to randomize? Can't we just do some kind of matching?" and "it would be much better to spend the money on a wider implementation of the program and practice oriented qualitative research." Recently the MST study was cancelled since all five MST teams declined to participate. Funding was transferred to the other two studies making them look more promising. A lot of resources have been used to prepare the studies and expectations are high. Hopefully by May 2012 the MTFC study will be recruiting families and the PMTO study will be ready to start recruiting in September 2012. If all goes well the two studies will be among the first RCTs carried out on social interventions in Denmark. Regulatory goals for a clinical study can be different from research and exploratory goals. For the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Phase 3 Investigational New Drug (IND) studies (i.e., adequate and well- controlled studies) will provide the primary clinical evidence to support a marketing application such as a Biologic License Application (BLA). To support approval and initiation of these studies, the protocol should cover all the statistical issues considered by the reviewers when assessing the study design and its ability to adequately address the study objectives. As an aid to statistical reviewers, as well as to improve efficiency and consistency in our reviews of these protocols, the Division of Biostatistics in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has developed a checklist outlining the important elements of a Phase 3 protocol. Some elements included in this checklist are consistency between the study objectives and endpoints; number and regions of study sites; statistical hypotheses; planned interim analyses; sample size assumptions and calculations; randomization description; blinding techniques; analysis populations; multiplicity considerations; missing data considerations; study success criterion; and study conduct. Original IND submissions with protocols with such elements may also lead to less correspondence with the sponsor to clarify items in the protocol. We note that the elements identified in this checklist may also be helpful in designing earlier phase studies as well as non-IND studies. This presentation will focus on the motivation, contents, and use of the checklist. In non-inferiority trials, a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority must be defined a priori. However, what happens when an acceptable risk varies according to physician risk tolerance or patient circumstances, so a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority cannot be easily defined? We will discuss a double-blind clinical trial in which SLE patients on long-term MMF therapy with stable disease are randomized to continue therapy or withdraw. It is expected that withdrawal from MMF will result in increased risk of disease reactivation; however, long- term MMF treatment is not without risk of side effects. The goal of the trial is to determine if the increase in risk of disease reactivation outweighs the benefits of withdrawal. One could frame this goal as a test of the non-inferiority hypothesis that the increased risk of disease reactivation is greater than a pre-specified margin, determined by potential benefit. However, how the risks and benefits should be weighed is highly individual, even for experienced rheumatologists. Rather than design the study to test a hypothesis of non- inferiority using an arbitrary risk margin that may or may not be relevant for any particular patient, the results of this trial will be reported as effect estimates for change in risk of disease reactivation in addition to other disease activity, safety, quality of life and medication use endpoints. These effect estimates and confidence intervals will describe the risks and benefits of withdrawal from study therapy and may be used to guide physicians and patients in making decisions based on individualized assessments of acceptable risk. As clinicians are likely to find interpretation of results difficult in the absence of hypothesis testing (and p-values), we will discuss the approach planned for disseminating clinical trial results. Cluster randomised trials (CRTs), compared to individually randomised trials, require specific analysis; statistical models need to take account of between-cluster variability. This abstract focuses on two main approaches to analysis, cluster-level (CL) and individual-level (IL), and examines their efficiency for the Training Caregivers After Stroke trial (TRACS). TRACS is a CRT evaluating a complex intervention in stroke rehabilitation with 928 dyads of patients and caregivers within 36 stoke rehabilitation units. The primary outcome is NEADL score at 6 months. CL analysis is attractive due to its simplicity. We compare performance of three techniques; simple summaries (using appropriate two- sample weighted t-tests), CL analysis adjusted for covariates and nonparametric methods. The CL approach is a two-stage method; in unadjusted analysis, a summary measure for each cluster is calculated and two sets of cluster-specific measures are compared using the weighted t-test. When performing CL analysis adjusted for covariates; we carried out an IL regression with all but intervention effect covariates ignoring the clustering effect. Secondly, we compared the residuals for each cluster between treatment arms using the weighted two-sample t-test. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used as a nonparametric substitute to the two-sample t- test. IL analysis, using a random effects linear mixed model with stroke rehabilitation units as level 2, was the preferred method, because of its greater computational convenience and it is possible to analyse the intervention effect and other covariates simultaneously. The CL approach is robust, particularly for a smaller number of clusters. However, it may not be statistically the most efficient, especially if clusters are of varying size. Such weighting is incorporated in IL analysis. Analysis of cluster randomised trials can be undertaken in a number of ways. We will present and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these analytical methods. Simple randomisation is the easiest method for allocating participants to treatment groups in clinical trials. In the long run it balances all features of participants across the groups but may not be suitable for small to medium sized trials, or for larger trials at the time of interim analysis. If important prognostic factors are identified at the design stage then minimisation can help to balance these features. There is uncertainty as to whether treatment groups need to be balanced at baseline, but many researchers believe this to be advantageous, allowing comparison between groups without the need for sophisticated analysis. Balance between treatment groups can be desirable in a range of scenarios: for small trials, interim analyses, early termination, analysis of subgroups or where the credibility of an unbalanced trial is considered problematic (e.g. in the case of a small treatment effect). Three completed trials of varying size, originally using minimisation as method of treatment allocation, were "re-randomised", in the order that participants joined the study, using simple randomisation. Datasets frozen at the time of either interim or full analysis were used. For all three trials treatment allocation was well balanced across prognostic variables and between treatment arms when using minimisation at all time points, i.e. for any number of participants recruited at that time. With simple randomisation, at each timepoint imbalances were identified that could have made analysis more difficult. In some cases the potential imbalance across treatment groups within a factor reached 100% (where all participants with a given characteristic were in the same treatment allocation group) and no amount of sophisticated analysis could compensate for this. The simulations demonstrated the need for incorporating minimisation into the randomisation algorithm of trials of any size in order to achieve treatment balance which cannot be achieved by using simple randomisation alone. A futility analysis is commonly utilized in clinical trials for early read of trial efficacy data. An investigational drug will be declared futile if the prespecified futility boundary is met, and the trial will be stopped. In a conventional group sequential design, a futility boundary is selected based on power preservation or sufficient conditional power, which protects the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis at the end of a trial. However, the observed treatment effect size is of increasing importance beyond rejecting the null hypothesis and is directly associated with the eventual success of drug development. To ensure a high probability of observing a desired effect size, or in another words a high probability of success, we propose a new futility analysis design approach where the futility boundary is selected based on preserving the probability of success. We define the relative preservation of this probability as "pseudo-power", using which we propose the boundary selection criteria. Via a case study, we evaluate various operational characteristic of this approach in term of the probability of correct and incorrect stopping, with respect to the futility boundary, the underlying true effect size and the timing of the futility analysis. Increasingly, the NIH and Industry sponsors are establishing large multi-center collaborative research efforts that implement multiple studies simultaneously through a network of investigators. This presents a challenge for the sponsors and leadership teams who are responsible for monitoring activities across studies. The business world has addressed this need for complex information monitoring systems with a high- level summarized overview called a dashboard. We created a web-based dashboard for the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), a large, federally-funded, multi-center research consortium. The consortium has eight active studies that are being conducted across ten clinical centers with total projected enrollment of over 3500 participants. Many research programs provide web-based resources to aid stakeholders with study supervision. Unfortunately, traditional study portals can be hindered by an overabundance of information and tedious top-down navigation. These characteristics make them an inefficient resource for large multi-center programs. Our dashboard avoids the typical information- dense, hierarchical construction of traditional websites in favor of a comprehensive single- webpage display that is easier for stakeholders to access and use. Dashboards summarize and display critical information on a single page, with an emphasis on graphical, rather than text-heavy displays. Our dashboard has a main page for the consortium, which provides comparative enrollment graphs for the active studies, and displays pertinent deadlines and announcements. Each study also has a dedicated page that follows this same "dashboard" approach. We update the dashboard data weekly. Sponsors have responded positively to the ICAC dashboard, voicing appreciation for the system's efficient presentation of data and ease of use. Given the success of the dashboard, we plan to expand the system to other federal and commercial programs. Our experience suggests that multi-center or multi-study programs would benefit from creating a dashboard to provide sponsors and network leadership teams with key study monitoring information in a quick, succinct manner. Due to the lack of infrastructure in resource poor settings and despite the strong need for Clinical Research coordination, Information and Communication Technology has not been systematically and sustainably integrated into health research, hospital administration and practice, thus limiting efficiency and outcomes of the efforts to fight poverty related diseases. Cloud-based technology could now overcome infrastructure scarcity problems of resource poor settings and thus greatly support Clinical Research by integrating mobile, online, offline and Voice over IP technology. The Italian Inter University Consortium Cineca, a non-profit Consortium of Italian Universities for high performance computing and ICT, has an over 20 year experience in providing technological support to health research for activities related to the design and development of IT systems and services in the health care and biomedical area, using advanced technologies and methodologies. In particular, since 2008 Cineca has been involved in projects providing and developing technology to collect and analyze clinical and health related data in Africa. The European funded project Medishare, coordinated by Cineca, successfully managed to collect standardized data for over 15000 patients affected by HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB in Kenya Tanzania and Uganda in one central database. Medishare was recognized supportive of the Millennium Development Goals by the United Nations. The Europe - Africa Research Network for Evaluation of Second-line Therapy (EARNEST) is a trial supported by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) that is successfully using Cineca integrated technology in Uganda, Malawi, Zimbabwe. Cineca exploits the integration of newer technologies to fill in the infrastructural gaps of Africa and provides a sustainable centralized infrastructure which is fully certified for quality, safety and security procedures. We have developed a LIMS to manage biobank samples for the Scottish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA) cohort study. Commercial and open-source solutions were evaluated and it was concluded that development of a bespoke LIMS system was needed to provide scalability and flexibility to support future projects with different requirements. The system developed includes a generic workflow which is capable of modelling:* Complex storage configurations with up to 1024 dimensions over multiple geographic sites * Storage rules for sample type, method and time of storage * Multi-event work flow processing from site collection to arrival at labs * Lab technician workflows incorporating working plate practices * Manual and automated validation methods using a combination of 1D and 2D barcode technologies The system is based on a tree structure; all samples are stored in a parentage tree that shows the lineage of the sample allowing for exploration of any number of generations of derived samples. Our tree based approach allows the LIMS to be largely generic. By defining the storage, site configuration and the collection protocols the system can operate with scenarios ranging from a single lab collecting ad-hoc samples, to a multi-lab, multi collection site protocol hosting thousands of samples. We will discuss the functionality provided by the LIMS system, the tree based design and the possibilities it allows, the pros and cons of the development, its integration with two additional large multicentre, multinational, clinical trials and future functionality enhancements. The Glasgow Safe Haven aims to provide the physical location and informatics infrastructure to permit confidential and secure access to routinely collected healthcare data for research purposes. We will discuss the design of this infrastructure illustrating how the availability of routinely collected data can potentially enhance the design and delivery of clinical trials. This will include: * Extraction of prescription and laboratory data during the follow-up phase of a clinical trial * Identification of potentially eligible participants for a multicentre clinical trial in sub-clinical hypothyroidism using centrally held routinely collected laboratory data * Building a clinical data warehouse in specific disease areas to support clinical trial feasibility assessment. We will discuss the proposed governance and access structure. The presentation will be illustrated with examples of trials that will benefit from this infrastructure. The Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow have been involved in the development of electronic solutions to enhance the conduct of clinical research projects for many years. This includes integrated secure electronic solutions for enrolment and randomisation (web and IVRS), electronic data capture and management via e-CRF (on- and off-line), trial management, information delivery and reporting, eg Independent Data Monitoring Committees. Our systems have been implemented for many clinical trials both commercial and academic. To enhance our ability to produce robust and validated systems efficiently we foresaw a requirement for a standardized library of components. In addition, our systems have to be able to provide specific functionality in accordance with our trial requirements. Included in our system:Standard screens and functionality to allow trial co-ordinators to register their own users and assign the appropriate access rights.Inclusion of previously developed screens eg standard questionnairesDemographicsConcomitant medicationsMedical historyStandard measurements eg Height, Weight, Blood PressureAdverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, and regulatory reporting requirementsMetrics required for reporting to funders within the United KingdomImplementation of CDISC SDTM to standardize our databasesNotification and communication to users, either by email or bulletin style within the systemDocument repository to ensure all sites have correct versions of approved documents We will discuss the implementation of these components in our recent clinical trial systems and how this has improved efficiency in delivering validated systems to our clients. In addition, we will discuss and further explore our implementation of CDISC formats Objective. We present a community developed system focussing on clinical sites, operated as a service by the Clinical Trials Center of the University of Cologne, which employs collaborative peer reviewing in order to support timeliness, efficacy, accuracy and safety in site management. Background. Managing clinical sites in a trial can be very resource-intensive for sponsor and for study site, this, largely due to disconnect in systems and processes, impeding different parties from collaboratively capturing organizational data meaningful to all. Methods. Sponsors, Coordinating Centers, Sites, Study Groups, Societies, Networks and other relevant parties participating in clinical trials each are individually best positioned and incentivized to capture and/or monitor certain organizational trial data. On clinicalsite.org role-based access and specific views enhance individual value and incentives. Reusability of data, meaningful to all, provides the strongest incentive. As a case in point, roles and responsibilities in a trial can be syndicated to be displayed on institutional websites. The data can also be aggregated to the trial track record by the investigator as part of his CV. The sponsor, in turn, can review site and investigator qualifications electronically, cutting turnaround considerably. Furthermore, with roles formally captured and confirmed, the system can act as a Physician Master Index and provide authentication and authorization credentials for external systems. A plugin framework enables parties to embed their own apps while saving the data locally. An API for various services and formats can serve data for aggregation within external systems. Both options provide added value and minimize centrally hosted data, ensuring better data privacy compliance. Results. Currently 1282 trials with 1681 investigators and 997 organizational units involved are managed in the system. Conclusion. Our approach provides critical organizational data of quality with less effort. Exposing the data for reuse and aggregation unlocks new possibilities within and outside the system. Within any organization the workflow structure and departments are clearly defined. Through a case study we will examine the lessons learned and outcomes when staff within specific departments are trained round robin to understand the functions of other departments. By specifically reviewing the cross training of Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) to periodically perform data entry within a CRO, we show meaningful subject matter expertise improvements, positive study impact, and a gain in project efficiency. Pros: Learning Experience: The trainer becomes more familiar with details of his or her position when outlining a training program to teach others. The trainee once completing the instructional information has a broader picture of the entire process and often is able to see the bigger picture and the results of where their work is going. Error Identification: CRA's have the skills to notice consistency errors that a site may be making emphasizing the need for additional training or reeducation in a particular area. CRAs have the expertise to identify clinical errors including but not limited to the incorrect use of a specific form and inclusion/exclusion criteria errors. Cons: Time and Funds: CRA's are often paid at a higher rate than data entry staff and their talents may be better utilized in their respective area of expertise. Analysis of Data: CRA's in most cases have a significant understanding of site operations and clinical information which usually equates to a slow data entry process as they are always scouring data for errors and not just entering what is documented. After considering both pros and cons and the review of a case study where CRA's perform data entry tasks for quality purposes this often proves to be beneficial not only to the project, but Corporate Structure and capabilities. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was a randomized controlled trial, funded by the National Cancer Institute, to determine whether screening with low-dose helical computed tomography reduces lung cancer mortality relative to screening with conventional chest x-ray in persons at elevated risk of lung cancer. It was comprised of two components: the Lung Screening Study (LSS) and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN). The Coordinating Center (CC) for the LSS (n=34,614) provided coordination and data management support for 10 screening sites. One CC challenge was to ensure completeness and accuracy of data collected throughout all stages of the study (e.g., recruitment, screening, follow up, endpoint verification, close-out). As part of monitoring, the CC conducted visits to each site annually for 9 years. Visits included observation of procedures and random chart audits. Chart audits served to confirm source documents for consents; eligibility and randomization verification; screening results; and diagnostic evaluation and followup. On-site monitoring also provided an opportunity to review and reinforce key study elements with project staff. Annual assessments of the CC audit plan resulted in 6 revisions to the audit form and 4 revisions to the chart selection, reflecting evolving focus from recruitment through close- out. Throughout the trial, 2457 randomly selected charts (7%) were reviewed. Source documents verified ~ 50 data elements during Year 1 and >150 data elements in later years. While chart audits confirmed overall data integrity, selected findings included 17 changes in eligibility status, 18 new protocol violations, and >200 requests for data clarification and modification. The CC found that chart audits were an important part of the total monitoring plan, and that it was important to develop a flexible approach. We will present the challenges of chart audits as part of a monitoring plan throughout the lifecycle of this complex long-term multi- center trial. Clinical trial sponsors are required to set up appropriate measures to monitor the conduct of the trial. The aim of monitoring is to ensure the patients' well being, compliance with the approved protocol and regulatory requirements, as well as data accuracy and completeness. Classical monitoring approaches that rely on on-site visits are useful for some of these purposes, but extensive source data verification is extremely time consuming and may have only a limited impact on data quality. It is therefore not surprising that the current practice of performing intensive on-site monitoring is coming into question and that interest focuses on more pragmatic, risk- based approaches that improve the cost- effectiveness ratio without compromising the quality and integrity of clinical trials. A recent draft guidance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reflects this trend and states unequivocally: "FDA encourages greater reliance on centralized monitoring practices than has been the case historically, with correspondingly less emphasis on on-site monitoring". In this presentation, we first review the potential sources of data errors in clinical trials. We then outline the principles of central statistical monitoring and the challenges of its implementation in actual trials. Results from both terminated and on-going trials are presented to illustrate typical findings that can be expected from the monitoring approach. We conclude by a discussion of the potential role and limitations of central statistical monitoring, and we argue that it can both optimize on-site monitoring and improve the quality of clinical trial data. Reference: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM269919.pdf (accessed 10 November 2011). Due to a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of clinical trials and the costs associated with them, the FDA recently introduced a draft guidance "Oversight of Clinical Investigations - A Risk-based Approach to Monitoring". This new guidance suggests it is acceptable to use alternative approaches to monitoring clinical trials including remote monitoring, centralized monitoring, and risk-based monitoring. The guidance also suggests that source data verification should be focused on critical fields (key efficacy and safety variables) and less than 100% source data verification for less important fields may be acceptable. The guidance gives a clear signal encouraging sponsors to explore cost-effective ways to conduct clinical monitoring instead of relying solely on the on-site monitoring. KAI Research, Inc. has used a variety of alternative approaches to assess data quality and patient safety in its support of NIH clinical trials which often do not have budgets for 100% monitoring. We will describe lessons learned from implementing risk based monitoring approaches that include a central data review to identify potential anomalies. The anomalies help to focus site visits. Focusing on critical data elements has also helped to streamline monitoring visits. We have also implemented centralized monitoring techniques on a sample of data from each of the sites in a study. Through a description of these examples, we will demonstrate alternative methods for ascertaining data quality and subject protection that are both cost effective and efficient. We will also describe how our monitoring plans consider complexity of the study, risk associated with the intervention as well as its safety profile, severity of the illness of the study subjects and experience of the investigators and study sites. We will demonstrate that well thought out alternative approaches to monitoring can meet FDA's expectations for quality assurance and participant safety. Considerable time and expense are incurred to ensure data quality in a long-term clinical trial. The Protocol Monitor assumes much of the scientific responsibility of closely checking the accuracy and completeness of data collected prior to construction of the final data set. Administrative responsibilities involve assuring clinical sites' adherence to the protocol, federal guidelines and regulations. Eighty-two clinical sites participate in the Age- Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) and are following approximately 4,000 participants throughout five years of follow-up. Data pertaining to effects of supplemental doses of xanthophylls and omega-3 fatty acids on the progression of age-related macular degeneration and vision loss, among other clinical outcomes, are collected at annual visits. Four AREDS2 Protocol Monitors serve as the front line of communication between the study leadership and the clinical sites. The Monitors employ multiple strategies to assist the sites in meeting project deliverables. Routine performance includes standardized protocol review calls on a variety of topics and frequent review of multiple types of data anomaly reports. Monitoring responsibilities constantly change in nature and effort with the revolving door of new Clinic Coordinators and amendments or additions to the protocol through the life of the study. When a new Clinic Coordinator is hired by a site, the Monitor must quickly determine the Coordinator's knowledge of the protocol, disease topic, and general skills required for the proper conduct of clinical trials. Some clinical sites have educational sessions in place or access to the previous Clinic Coordinator, and others do not. The monitor also carries much historical knowledge of a site's subject population and may serve as a valuable resource to the new Clinic Coordinator. The many different hats of a Protocol Monitor, as experienced in AREDS2, will be described as both a challenging and rewarding experience. It has been suggested that central statistical monitoring may serve as the foundation for quality assurance and center monitoring in multicenter clinical trials (Knatterud 1998; Buyse 1999; Baiget 2008; Eisenstein 2008). Authors have proposed that central statistical monitoring may identify procedural errors, data errors and data fabrication at centers. Since there are no published evaluations of the different ways of performing central statistical monitoring to detect fraud, we constructed several prognostic models using data from a multi-center trial in which the data from 9 of 196 centers were documented to be fabricated. These data were used to build a series of risk scores to predict fraud at centers. Five different risk scores were identified and each had the ability to discriminate well between centers with and without fabricated data (area under the curve values ranged from 0.90 to 0.95). True and false positive rates are presented for each risk score to arrive at a recommended cut off of 7 or above (high risk score) out of a possible score of 12. We validated these risk scores, using an independent multi-center trial database that contained no data fabrication and found the occurrence of false positive high risk scores to be low and comparable to the model-building data set. With further validation, these risk scores may become part of a series of tools that provide evidence- based central statistical monitoring, which in turn may improve the efficiency of trials, and minimize the need for expensive on-site monitoring. Phase II studies in cancer usually consider short-term outcomes such as response, that are to some degree 'surrogates' of phase III outcomes, most typically overall survival (OS). Understanding the relationships between phase II and phase III outcome measures is essential in designing phase II trials and understanding the degree of reliability with which we can move between phases. We consider the association between alternative phase II outcome measures and OS in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC), to identify measures which may predict treatment effect on OS in phase III trials. Phase II outcomes of response, disease control, continuous tumour measurements and progression-free survival (PFS) were considered. Using surrogacy methodology originally proposed by Buyse et al (2000), estimates of R-squared(R2) were calculated to assess the relationship with OS for each outcome. Individual patient data on 5435 patients from seven trials of aCRC, recruited between 1999 and 2007, were obtained. Data from three 3- arm trials were split to form two treatment comparisons each, resulting in a total of 10 grouping units. As the reference outcome, response was found to have poor predictive ability of the treatment effect on OS, with R2 (trial)=0.14, 95% CI (-0.28,0.56). A much stronger relationship was observed for continuous tumour measurements (R2(trial) =0.65 (0, 0.86)) and PFS (R2(trial)=0.59 (0.18,1.00)). The relationship between OS and disease control was slightly weaker, but still stronger than for response, with R2(trial) =0.44, 95% CI (-0.05,0.93). Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate alternative grouping units and the impact of covariates. Issues faced in applying surrogacy methodology to the phase II setting, and using these results to identify an optimal outcome measure for phase II aCRC trials, will be discussed. Specific issues include the use of OS as an appropriate phase III outcome, comparability of R2 values for differing outcome measures, and the number of grouping units incorporated. Since 2004, we have developed five phase II trials in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), utilising six different statistical methods. Two trials have closed to recruitment and three are currently open. The rationale behind the different designs and methodologies used will be explained. Difficulties and learning experiences with the implementation, wider understanding and interpretation of the trials will be discussed. CLL201 used Gehan's two-stage approach to assess response, and randomised to a control arm which was not included for formal comparison, but to give validity of the study results. The two stage approach was difficult to implement and of limited use as it only considered efficacy and not safety. Challenges were faced regarding the inclusion and interpretation of the control arm, although randomisation proved to be valuable. CLL207 was a single arm trial designed using Bryant and Day's two-stage design, incorporating toxicity considerations as well as efficacy. The two-stage aspect worked well, but the implementation of a toxicity stopping guide proved problematic. ARCTIC and ADMIRE are two large, randomised phase IIb trials, both formally powered to compare responses against a common control arm. One of the trials assesses non-inferiority. The choice of the unusual phase II design, and difficulties in justifying it to reviewers will be discussed. COSMIC is a randomised selection design with two experimental arms, combining two phase II trial designs to firstly assess efficacy, and secondly select the treatment to be taken forward. The A'Hern one-stage design is used to determine which treatments are eligible to be further investigated. In the case where both are acceptable, Sargent & Goldberg's selection criteria will be used. The sample size was inflated to ensure acceptable power for selecting the best treatment. Single-arm Phase II consolidation/maintenance trials in oncology are currently designed to show an improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) when considered against historical controls. PFS includes duration of second line therapy (SLT), treatment free interval (TFI), and time on the investigational therapy (IT). We hypothesize that the duration of SLT, the time on the investigational therapy and patient enrollment plan can affect efficacy measures from maintenance trials and might result in underpowered studies. Efficacy data from four published single-arm consolidation therapies in second remission in ovarian cancer (Sabbatini et al, Gyn Onc 2010, 116(1):66-71) are used for illustration. The studies were designed to show increase in estimated median PFS from 9 to 13.5 months (mos). We partitioned PFS as the sum of the duration of SLT, TFI, and duration of IT. We calculated the statistical power when IT is given concurrently with SLT or following SLT by varying the start of IT. Required sample sizes varied with duration of SLT. If IT starts with initiation of SLT, only 34 patients are needed to provide 80% power to detect a 33% hazard reduction. Alternatively, if one accrues 34 patients at start of SLT with expected 33% hazard reduction and the duration of SLT delays the start of IT to 7.5 months, the power drops to 50%. To maintain 80% power in this scenario, either the protocol therapy would have to reduce the hazard by 50%, or sample size would have to increase to 104. A longer duration of SLT is associated with lower statistical power unless the magnitude of benefit with the new investigational treatment is greater than expected, or the sample size is increased. Designs of consolidation trials should take into account the duration of SLT, by either excluding it from the definition of PFS or restricting it per protocol. Background: RCTs frequently use mortality review committees to assign a cause of death (COD) rather than relying on COD assignments on death certificates (DCs). The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), an RCT of lung cancer screening with low dose radiation computed tomography versus chest x-ray among heavy and/or long-term smokers, used a committee blinded to arm assignment to determine whether COD was due to lung cancer. Methods: NLST's committee reviewed a subset of deaths, chosen by a pre-determined algorithm. The algorithm selected deaths with a DC COD that were most likely to represent a death due to lung cancer (either directly or indirectly) and deaths that might have been erroneously assigned a DC lung cancer COD. Also included were deaths within six months of a screen suspicious for lung cancer and within 60 days of certain lung cancer diagnostic evaluation procedures. Using the committee assignment as the gold standard and a lung cancer COD as the outcome of interest, we calculated positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the death certificate COD assignment (lung cancer vs. non-lung cancer). Results: The committee examined and assigned COD for 1643 deaths (42% of the 3877 NLST deaths). Sensitivity was 90%; specificity, 97%; PPV, 97%; and NPV, 88%. The kappa statistic was 0.87. 40% of the deaths with a DC non-lung cancer COD reclassified to lung cancer had a DC COD of a neoplasm other than lung. Limitations: 2141 deaths with a DC-non lung cancer COD were not reviewed because the DC COD was unlikely to have been in error. Had these deaths been reviewed and assigned a non-lung cancer COD, the specificity would have been 99% and the NPV 97%. Conclusions: When assigning lung cancer COD among heavy/long-term smokers, death certificates provide accurate information nearly all the time. To streamline the implementation of clinical studies, reduce start-up time and accelerate data aggregation across studies, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) together with KAI Research, Inc. (KAI), embarked on common data element (CDE) projects. KAI has developed a systematic approach to the development and implementation of data standards. These standards span the entire study lifecycle, facilitating study start up, data collection and management, and data archiving and sharing. With more and more CDEs developed, establishing standard approaches to manage CDEs becomes critical. This abstract will provide information on the challenges with creating, implementing and managing standards. The challenges as well as our best practices in overcoming these challenges are:- Keeping up with current standards (CDISC, caBIG, etc.) Harmonization efforts ongoing Regular communications with these groups key- Reviewing the Literature Including references for the CDEs adds credibility Publications may lack detailed data management information- Limiting the universe Identification of core CDEs (those most essential for data collection) Build from existing forms to gain buy in from the clinical research community- Creating a team of experts Identifying who should be part of the team Advantages and disadvantages to top down vs. bottom up development- Establishing standard procedures for standard development Development of standard procedures in parallel to standards Internal standard review committee for quality and consistency- Tools to enhance use Dictionary, template forms, suggested edits, data management plan (DMP), etc. Website design/ layout - making it user friendly. The process for creating, implementing and managing standards has been met with many challenges but the benefits outweigh the frustrations. CDEs and standards have demonstrated enhanced data quality, decreases the time and resources needed to develop a study database, and helps customize the DMP. The Practitioners Engaged in Applied Research and Learning (PEARL) Network, a National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research- sponsored network of practice-based dentists have successfully created a data service on the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid's (caBIG's) open source platform (caGrid). PEARL has registered the semantically annotated model and implemented the necessary registration interface steps and posted the de-identified clinical data on the caGrid. PEARL has taken the needed steps to create harmonized, semantic metadata in order to leverage the collaborative nature of caBIG with use of caBIG grid architecture and services. PEARL created the metadata based on the International Organization for Standardization Metadata 11179 Model in the Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) which uses the semantic linkages of the hierarchical ontology contained in the National Cancer Institute's Enterprise Vocabulary Service. New components created by PEARL are:1321 Data Elements999 Data Element Concepts254 Value Domains PEARL used caBIG grid architecture to share Oral Health Inventory Profile and Tooth Sensitivity data from a study of postoperative hypersensitivity (Study PRL0602) following resin-based composite restoration of posterior teeth. The related Unified Modeling Language (UML) model for this data set has been registered in the caDSR where the related CDEs are classified as part of the UML model and visible in the UML Model Browser as a collection. PEARL encountered some challenges during implementation. Firstly, some issues and bugs had to be resolved with the system configuration and web services communication that required additional steps between PEARL and the caGrid team. Additionally, the caGrid data extraction process is not as intuitive as anticipated, and requires detailed instructions to overcome this barrier to data sharing. The projected benefit is that exposing clinically relevant data and the needed descriptive metadata that underpins those data provides informed, meaningful access to researchers, clinicians, and patients. The Clinical Trials Management Systems (CTMS) workspace within the caBIG® program was tasked to deliver integrated software solutions to the clinical research community. These tools are vetted by the community, who require the ability to securely gather, exchange, explore, integrate, and reuse data and information for clinical trials research. As a result the CTMS Workspace developed modular, interoperable and standards-based software tools designed to meet diverse clinical trials data management needs. The tools developed were configurable to work within trial sites with little or no clinical data management systems in place, as well as those sites with extensive existing systems. These tools took into account the diversity of clinical research activities and local practices that existed among trial sites. CTMS software tools enable management of clinical trials tasks such as: patient registration; patient scheduling; integration of laboratory results; adverse events capture/reporting; and the capture, analysis and sharing of clinical data among relevant systems. All tools are also available as a modular enterprise clinical trials management system designed to facilitate clinical workflows and data sharing in single and multi-site settings for use in trial sites. To continue the development/support of these tools with community and industry participation, the caBIG® program is evolving from its role as an active software developer to a facilitator of open source, community-based development. The NCI will provide a range of mechanisms to support open-source development efforts, including:* Processes to report software defects and suggest feature requests, * Forums for information exchange, * Resources for software version control and distribution, * Support of an open source governance framework with an emphasis on standards. We will discuss the implementation plan and the crucial factors for the continued development of these tools through the open-source model, and how this will serve the ultimate mission of furthering cancer research. When a clinical trial subject has a serious adverse event (SAE) or other significant adverse event (AE), such as those leading to the discontinuation of the study, a narrative is written for the clinical study report. These AE narratives summarize the details surrounding the event to enable understanding of the circumstances that may have led to the occurrence and its subsequent management. Such details may include the dose of study drug at the time of the event, the duration of the dose prior to the event, concomitant medications taken at the time of the event and used to treat the event, and other AEs that may have recently occurred. Other details include demography, medical history, laboratory results, the severity of the event and whether the event was related to study medication. Narratives are typically written from the original SAE report faxed from the clinical site in combination with data listings generated as part of the study deliverables. Information contained in the typical narrative requires manual review of these disparate data sources. This is time- consuming and often will require additional review and quality control. Too often, these narratives are written when the full data becomes available, which may become a rate-limiting factor in completing the study report. Since its inception in 1997, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) has developed standards for data models, study design and supporting clinical trial documents. CDISC standards have made such gains that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research strongly encourages their use and implementation for the submission of new drug applications. The benefits of CDISC standards for statistics, programming and data management are well established. We will illustrate how these data standards can be used to facilitate composition of adverse event narratives. Background: Unique characteristics of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) complicate the interpretation of standard research ethics guidelines, including from whom, when, and how informed consent ought to be obtained. As part of a larger project to generate ethics guidelines for CRTs, we reviewed a random sample of 300 published CRTs and found that participant consent was reported in only 63% of trials. Whether this reflects an under- reporting of consent, or actual consent practices, is unclear. We therefore conducted a survey of the CRT investigators to (a) gather detailed information about consent practices in the selected CRT, and (b) investigate factors associated with obtaining participant consent in CRTs. Methods: A web-based survey was administered to corresponding authors of the sample of CRTs, in a series of six contacts. Trialists surveyed were based in USA/Canada (47%), UK/Ireland (18%), elsewhere in Europe (21%), Australia/New Zealand (5%), and various low/middle income countries (9%). Results: The survey response rate was 64%. Participant consent had been sought for some aspect of the study in 93% of trials: in 79% of trials consent had been sought from participants at the individual level (56% for the experimental intervention(s), 75% for data collection). Among CRTs with participants at the cluster level, 82% indicated that consent had been sought from cluster level participants (62% for the experimental intervention(s), 75% for data collection). Factors associated with individual level consent for the experimental intervention(s) were a smaller cluster size, and whether experimental and data collection interventions were targeted at the individual level. In addition, setting (healthcare vs. non-healthcare) was associated with seeking individual level consent for data collection. Conclusion: Unique characteristics of the CRT design are associated with participant consent practices, which are under-reported in CRT publications. Further ethical analysis is required to determine whether CRT consent practices meet the highest ethical standards. In some cases it is difficult for study participants to obtain access to a successful study intervention after the conclusion of a clinical trial. A number of international ethical guidelines call for researchers to provide access to products post trial for study participants when they are proven effective and unavailable through local mechanisms. The nature of this ethical obligation is debated, and the moral basis for such an obligation should help determine who bears responsibility for fulfilling it. There is no consensus among bioethicists about whether this is a firm obligation and if so, whether it is based on the idea of reciprocity or gratitude, as a safeguard against exploitation, as compensation for risk or burden, or some other basis. Also, ethical analysis is complicated by the fact that other community members who need the same medical care may have a competing claim for access to the product. Moreover, practical challenges in ensuring post trial access are numerous, and often multiple stakeholders need to be engaged. An interesting consequence of the call for post trial access is that many pharmaceutical companies decline to participate in research studies in countries where they have no plans to register their products. When studies are conducted in developing countries, challenges may arise due to slow or non-existent regulatory structures, lack of funds for product procurement and delivery, and lack of infrastructure. For research sponsors such as NIH, lack of authorization to use funds for non- research purposes may hamper efforts to support post trial access. These ethical and practical challenges will be discussed in detail, with recommendations for future policies to address them. Background: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) have unique characteristics that complicate the interpretation of standard research ethics guidelines. We conducted an international web-based survey of research ethics chairs in advance of a consensus meeting to generate ethics guidelines for CRTs. Methods: We included all biomedical ethics committees in Canada and the UK, and a random sample from the USA (one per institution). After the initial e-mail invitation, we sent three e-mail reminders and a final postal reminder. The 45-minute questionnaire presented three hypothetical CRTs evaluating: a community-level health promotion intervention, an educational intervention targeted at health professionals, and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets to villages in a low income country. Using closed- and open-ended items, participants were asked to indicate the type of review required (full board or expedited), whom they would consider research subjects, and objections that might be raised "Use of Lorazepam for the Treatment of Pediatric Status Epilepticus: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Trial of Lorazepam and Diazepam" (Status2), is a protocol conducted under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA) to evaluate efficacy and safety of lorazepam compared to diazepam in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in status epilepticus (SE). Because of the potentially life threatening presentation, the narrow therapeutic window, and the lack of proven, effective treatments for SE in the pediatric population, this study was approved under the auspices of 21 CFR 50.24, the Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) for Emergency Research. Navigating the regulatory requirements required significant sponsor, study management and site resources. The design of the protocol included informed consent, data collection and follow up procedures to assure protection of human subjects under EFIC. All sites (14) conducted community consultation and public disclosure activities that were reviewed and approved by the sponsor and local IRBs. The sponsor created training materials on the EFIC regulations to educate study personnel and local IRB members and to assist with community consultation planning. Opt-out procedures were implemented at each site and nationally prior to study initiation. Due to the emergency nature of SE, protocol deviations were common. These included incorrect weight estimation and therefore inaccurate dosing, and failure to adhere to timely study procedures. Study monitoring included assuring that legally authorized representatives of study subjects were approached in a timely manner and that opt-out and study procedures were followed in accordance with the study protocol. In conclusion, significant resources are required to meet the requirements of the Exception from Informed Consent regulations. Emergency conditions may preclude a carefully controlled study environment, so good training and monitoring are required to ensure that all protocol deviations are accurately recorded and reported to local IRBs. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is the most common safety-related reason for withdrawing a drug from the market. Therefore, it is critical to assess potential hepatotoxicity from treatment using an analysis of liver-related laboratory tests. A starting point is to plot peak values of lab measurements with regard to the upper limit of normal reference ranges to identify patients with elevated levels of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase as potential Hy's Law cases. However, this plot alone does not acknowledge the temporal considerations of Hy's Law and liver injury. Following the FDA Guidance of DILI evaluation, this view can be augmented to flag patients based on the occurrence of elevated liver tests within a clinically- relevant time period. Moreover, by incorporating the temporal dependence of liver test elevations, the frequency and duration of Hy's Law instances across treatment groups can be interrogated and reported. This presentation will highlight a statistically-driven interactive visualization approach implemented in JMP Clinical software to streamline the detection of potential DILI cases through summary views of lab test elevations and Hy's Law occurrence that lead to targeted patient time trend plots and cross-domain profiles for further clinical insight. It can be challenging to perform a concise and easily-interpretable analysis of adverse events (AEs). For therapeutic areas where patients have frequent AEs, understanding the safety profile of a new intervention is critical. In these instances, however, understanding the analysis is made more difficult by the sheer number and variety of AEs that occur. Traditionally, the incidence of adverse events is presented in lengthy tables, with coded AE terms grouped by body system or system organ class and presented in order of descending frequency. Many times, statistical testing is not be performed due to the high likelihood of committing multiple Type I errors. Further tables may highlight AEs that occur for specific periods of time (for example, treatment phase or off-treatment follow-up). Needless to say, it is difficult to summarize this information to gain a clear understanding of the risk (or benefit) a new therapy may present. Incidence analyses of adverse events are straightforward to present graphically using Volcano Plots to highlight treatment differences. Color indicates the treatment with higher incidence, with bubble size representing the total number of events that occur during the trial. Adjustments for multiple comparisons can be presented in a manner to clearly indicate which events exhibit statistically significant treatment differences. Further, the study can be broken into distinct time windows, with multiple plots or animation displaying changes in adverse event risk over time. This presentation can emphasize early differences across treatments that may eventually resolve or highlight events that could approach significance given a longer study duration. The use of Volcano Plots is illustrated with an analysis of data on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We describe the challenge of collecting adverse events (AE) data in an unmasked randomized treatment trial. The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study randomized 1,636 participants to either observation or to treatment with eye drops to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent the development of glaucoma. Masking would have been impossible to maintain. Participants could become unmasked at free IOP screenings or non-study eye examinations. Clinic personnel would become unmasked by measuring IOP to adjust medication to achieve IOP treatment targets. Efficacy outcomes were masked, but AE data were collected by unmasked clinic personnel and participant self-report. At 24 months, 774 AE's had been received, 31% in the observation group and 69% in the medication group. The clinic to clinic rate in AE reporting ranged from 7% to 60% signaling a standardization problem. To improve standardization, we reduced branching logic, consolidated forms, included more check boxes and used a scripted interview. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended that AE data received prior to these protocol changes be excluded from future publications. In the 18 months after these protocol changes, 1,688 AE reports were received, more than double the previous rate, 44% of the AE's were in the observation group and 56% in the medication group. It is striking that the differential between groups decreased from 38% to 12%. This suggests that potential surveillance or detection bias in an unmasked treatment trial can be reduced by a rigorous protocol. Stem cell clinical trials for cardiovascular disease in the last decade have been well tolerated with preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy. Standardization of endpoints is important to facilitate comparisons across studies. We describe our methods of safety and efficacy assessment based on our experience coordinating multiple studies using various cell populations and administration methods. Adverse events (AEs) are collected after enrollment, evaluated by independent medical monitors throughout the trial and coded using the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and reviewed every 6-months by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) are defined as death, hospitalization for heart failure or non-fatal recurrent myocardial infarction. Patients are evaluated for complications during study product administration and within 24-48 hours. Cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin) are collected every 12 hours for the first 48 hours. Echocardiograms are performed following the procedure and within 24-48 hours to assess for pericardial effusions. Incidence of arrhythmias is assessed by ambulatory electrocardiograms. Hospitalizations are adjudicated independently and classified as cardiac related or not. Ectopic tissue formation is assessed using CT scan. Functional benefit is evaluated using New York Heart Association Class, Six Minute Walk Test, Peak VO2, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Quality of life is measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used for assessing global and regional function. Patients who are device dependent undergo cardiac CT at baseline and 12 months. Clinical trials of cardiovascular cell therapy are expanding due to the excellent safety profile and early signs of efficacy. Safety is paramount and constantly monitored. Centralized cores such as imaging labs are important to maintain consistency and independence. As therapies evolve, consistency in the endpoint assessment should be considered to ensure comparability across studies. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) require efficient subject recruitment and retention. Often the management of such a trial poses significant challenges. EAGLE (Effectiveness, in Angle closure Glaucoma, of Lens Extraction) is an international multi-centre, pragmatic, publicly funded randomised controlled trial (RCT). EAGLE addresses whether removal of the lens of the eye for newly diagnosed Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma results in better clinical, economic and patient focussed outcomes compared with standard management. The EAGLE management team are UK based; however identification, recruitment and three year participant follow up is executed by staff working in sites across the UK, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, (Peoples Republic Of) China and Australia. The EAGLE study design requires minimal direct contact between the UK management team and the participant. The maintenance of effective working relationships between the UK management team and the international recruiting teams is, therefore, crucial to project success. To conduct EAGLE across different health care, legal, and cultural settings, a robust but pragmatic protocol was designed. A process for individual site assessment in terms of suitability as a recruiting site was developed involving honest discussion of trial budget and realistic timelines at outset. Maintaining momentum and focus on the research question among collaborators was addressed through site visits, regular scheduled video conferences, newsletter bulletins and an ongoing training regime of bespoke design that altered as appropriate when the trial matured and entered new phases. Global teleconferences were negotiated across time zones. Escalating costs of printing and translating trial paperwork into three different languages required re-profiling of a fixed budget without compromising trial delivery. This paper describes the challenges encountered in EAGLE across the first half of its data collection journey and the strategies employed to overcome them. The EAGLE study experience is widely applicable to any centrally managed international multi-centre RCT. Background: Multicenter clinical trials are designed to generate data that may be generalized across diverse populations with the goal of facilitating unbiased answers to important medical questions. The Food and Drug Administration, the Office of Human Research Protections, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) support the use of a centralized IRB review process, that is, a single IRB of record for a given protocol, to improve multicenter trial efficiency. Most recently, the DHHS proposed to change the Common Rule to include mandated centralized review for multicenter trials; however, there are concerns that the benefits of centralized review have not been sufficiently demonstrated. Methods: We identified published articles relating to centralized review through PubMed and hand searching. We categorized articles by topic and type (commentary or empirical research). Results: Our review includes 78 sources. Of these, 22 articles describe inefficiencies and inconsistencies with multiple review (12 empirical), 4 articles compare multiple to central review (1 empirical), and 5 articles describe barriers to the adoption of central review (1 empirical). The single empirical study directly comparing multiple and central review showed that affiliation with a central IRB was associated with faster reviews and financial savings. Several limitations of the empirical work were noted: 1) Absent a standardized metric for measuring review quality, all studies focus on efficiency, without informing the debate over the ethical quality of central versus local review, 2) Methodological quality is weak, as the majority of articles are case studies using a sample size of less than 20, and 3) The existing empirical work is not generalizable, as it is unclear how descriptions of prior practices would carry over to a still-undefined system of mandated centralized review. Conclusions: The limitations of the existing empirical work constrain meaningful conclusions about centralized review. The storage and tracking of regulatory documents in a large, long-term clinical trial can quickly become unmanageable without a proper tracking system. Gone are the days of manual files, as clinical trials move to the use of electronic regulatory tracking databases. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) is a multi-centered clinical trial designed to assess the effects of oral supplementation of high doses of macular xanthophylls and/or omega -3 fatty acids for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and cataract in just over 4,000 participants. The Administrator and Protocol Monitors at the AREDS2 Coordinating Center have the immense task of tracking regulatory documents for the 82 clinical sites and the 1200 past and present clinical site personnel. A customized electronic regulatory tracking system, Site Management Utility (SMU), was implemented to manage all regulatory documents including those required for study activation at participating sites. SMU enables staff to efficiently track such documents as IRB approvals, medical licenses, Human Subject Protection Training notifications, and protocol specific certifications. The utility also allows the Coordinating Center to maintain a full project contact list and archive of present and former staff. During the study start-up phase, SAS reports linked to regulatory information in SMU were generated to monitor completion of all requirements for study activation. Throughout study follow- up, a SAS program was run to generate automatic email reminders to the clinical sites at 60, 30, and 7 days prior to IRB and/or medical license expirations. SMU and other effective tools utilized at the Coordinating Center will be highlighted during this discussion of efficient methods of regulatory tracking and storage. EHR4CR (Electronic Health Records for Clinical Research) is a research project funded by the European Union Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) within the Innovative Medicines Initiative framework. EHR4CR is a collaborative project involving primarily universities, the pharmaceutical industry with input from organisations and groups representing patients and covering aspects of the law, ethics and technologies associated with the use of electronic data for research purposes. The EHR4CR project aims to improve the efficiency of, and reduce the cost of, conducting clinical trials, by better leveraging routinely collected clinical data through development of both an EHR4CR platform (primarily tools and services) and implementing an innovative and sustainable EHR4CR business model. Introducing innovative technology involves cost, new ways of working and organisational change. The multinational scope of the project means that every effort must be made to ensure that the approaches, methodologies and technologies conform to local and international legal and ethical requirements related to data protection, privacy and confidentiality. The project must also conform to the standards required by national and international drug regulators (MHRA, EMA, FDA, etc.) and satisfy the needs of the pharmaceutical industry. The approaches taken also need to be acceptable to the general public, patients, medical professionals (both study investigators and otherwise), and also to politicians and professional bodies sensitive to the concerns of their constituencies. Proactive management of the complex network of European stakeholders external to the EHR4CR project team is an essential task which will continue throughout the full four year lifecycle of the EHR4CR project. This presentation describes a pilot exercise that has been carried out in Scotland in order to develop a best practice approach for local national stakeholder identification, analysis engagement and management during the development phase of the EHR4CR project. A summary of the key outcomes of the Scottish pilot activity and the planned next steps for roll out of the stakeholder management process across Europe will be presented. Randomized Phase 2 oncology trials are mainly aimed at demonstration of improved efficacy (e.g. improved Progression Free Survival, Overall Survival) and acceptable safety profile of the target therapy versus the control therapy. With the development of the new bio-assay technology, biomarkers may provide an important role in demonstrating mechanism of action and pathway intervention of drugs and provide preliminary evidence of treatment effect of the target therapies. In addition, biomarkers may also be used to select patients who are mostly likely to benefit from the treatments. Based on preliminary biological hypothesis of the biomarkers, data generated from Phase 2 studies can be used to identify biomarkers that have predictive potentials on treatment effect. The potential predictive effect of biomarkers can then be further tested in large Phase 3 trials with adequate planning to provide more definitive evidence of the utility of the biomarker for patient selection. In this presentation, we will discuss the exploratory statistical analysis of biomarker data for randomized Phase 2 oncology trials and the impact of the analysis on Phase 3 study designs. Both continuous and categorical biomarker data will be discussed. Applications of statistical methodology including survival analysis, subgroup analysis, logistic regression analysis and time dependent ROC curves will be presented. Potential confounding factors of the biomarkers will be discussed. Experience on practical considerations in exploratory biomarker data analysis such as data collection and transfer, potential un-blinding, ascertainment rate will be shared. The sponsor owns the responsibility for a clinical study to comply with the protocol, including enrollment of patients who meet eligibility requirements. It is the responsibility of the investigator to give the best care available to patients. Struggles sometimes result when investigators, who have enthusiasm and optimism that a particular investigational drug will benefit their patients, have disappointment when trial eligibility criteria exclude patients that they want to enroll in a study. Patients who are enrolled into studies when they are on the edge of eligibility can chip away at the statistical power of a study to demonstrate treatment benefit. From the statistical perspective, having a homogeneous population with a smaller variance can have more statistical power for analysis than having a larger sample size when the population is more heterogeneous and the variability is greater. The enrichment design (referenced in FDA's Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics, Draft Guidance; CBER, CDER, 10 February 2010) when supported by a conditional sequence of hypothesis tests using methodologies proposed by Bauer (cited in the FDA's draft guidance on adaptive designs) offer an opportunity for a trial to enroll heterogeneous populations while protecting the ability for the study to be positive. Strategic utilization of the enrichment design can improve the likelihood of success of a study by using Bauer closed procedures. The proposed methodology has two major advantages: (1) using the conditional sequence of hypothesis tests to control multiplicity, alpha can be 0.05 for each hypothesis test while preserving the overall study-wise alpha at 0.05; and (2) it allows patient recruitment to permit "all comers" in the study protocol while protecting the primary analysis to be done in a subpopulation enriched with patients in whom the benefit may be easier to measure, hence, demonstrate Biomarkers are laboratory measures of biological processes. Because they are viewed to be objective and quantifiable by providing valuable information in both assessing exposure and disease status, they are increasingly used in biomedical and public health sciences, drug development programs, testing for targeted therapeutics and personalized medicine. This increased use creates a venue for the development of methods to address important, unexplored analytic issues such as properly handling biomarker measurements below the limit of detection (LOD). Researchers working with biomarker data inevitably have to deal with data containing non-detects, and how to combine non-detects with values above the LOD for data analysis. The common statistical analysis approach has been either to exclude measurements with LOD or perform ad-hoc single imputation techniques. Ad-hoc imputation techniques include replacing each measurement below the LOD with a value such as zero, a half of the detection limit, or LOD value itself, and then conducting the analysis under the assumption that the imputed values are the actual observed values. However, there are other parametric and nonparametric statistical methods, such as model based single imputation methods, Reverse Kaplan-Meier method, and multiple imputation methods that are not widely used in the literature but are better alternatives to ad-hoc single imputation techniques. We will facilitate broader use of all of these methods by describing their properties, illustrating their use with population-based data for secondhand smoke exposure research and showing how they can be calculated using standard software. This work was funded in by FAMRI, NIH, NIOSH. Biomarkers are a critical component of targeted therapies as they can be used to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from a particular treatment. Several prospective clinical trial designs for biomarker directed therapy have been previously proposed including the marker-stratified, sequential testing strategy, adaptive, and enrichment designs. These designs differ primarily in study populations (marker-defined or all-comers) and randomization scheme (fixed or adaptive). Recognizing the need for randomization yet acknowledging the possibility of remarkably promising results at interim, we propose a two-stage Phase II marker-positive design that allows for direct assignment in Stage II. In particular, Stage I of our proposed design randomizes marker- positive patients equally to receive targeted therapy or control, while Stage II has the option to adopt "direct assignment" whereby all Stage II patients receive the targeted therapy. Through simulation, we study the effect of varying the alpha decision cutoffs at interim and timing of interim analysis on power and Type I error rate. We compare our design with a balanced randomized two-stage design. Our results suggest relatively minimal loss in power (41,000 patients) were included (Figure 1). Based on RCTs, TXA was associated with a reduced risk of death versus aprotinin, while pairwise comparisons were inconclusive for MI, stroke, and renal failure/dysfunction; point estimates and coverage probabilities of these intervals suggested aprotinin was often associated with an elevated probability of increased risk (Table 1). When observational data were incorporated, pairwise comparisons showed increased risks of death with aprotinin relative to TXA and EACA, as well an increased risk of renal failure/dysfunction relative to all comparators. There were also probabilities suggestive of increased risks of MI with aprotinin compared to TXA and EACA (Table 1). Conclusions: Data suggests there remains reason for concern regarding aprotinin safety. While meta-analyses of RCTs can lack sufficient sample size to definitively identify harms imbalances, appropriate incorporation of observational evidence and use of network meta-analysis can help reduce uncertainty in analyses of such data. The success of translational research requires sound judgment in the planning and implementation of trials. Such planning involves synthesis of previous literature. We sought to determine the accessibility of preclinical efficacy studies in a cohort of novel investigational agents entering clinical development between 2000 and 2003. A cohort of initial human trials of new agents reported as full journal publications was identified through systematic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE. The cohort included 100 investigational agents, spanning 10 different indications. Identified agents were linked to preclinical studies by a search of references, EMBASE and PubMed. Preclinical evidence was considered published if at least one full journal article reported disease response in live, non-human animals. Of the 100 agents, 89 had published preclinical work, 80 of which tested the identical intervention and another 9 of which were based on closely related agents. Thirteen percent of agents published preclinical studies only after the initial human trial publication. Fifty-five percent of initial human trial articles referenced published animal work. Of the 89 agents, 57% had five or more animal studies available, 33% had between 2-4, and 10% had one preclinical study available. Of the 13 investigational agents that received eventual FDA approval, 12 had five or more preclinical studies available in the published record. The probability that preclinical evidence was publicly reported in more than five reports was significantly greater for FDA approved drugs than for drugs that did not receive licensure (85% vs. 38%; Yates' chi-squared test, p=0.002). This work demonstrates that a large proportion of investigational agents had at least some preclinical studies available. This suggests that preclinical knowledge synthesis for many new drugs is feasible--especially for those receiving licensure. However, we are unable to estimate what proportion of preclinical efficacy studies go unpublished. Smoking is directly responsible for 4500 deaths each year in New Zealand (NZ) including 22% of all Maori deaths. Despite the proven efficacy of various cessation approaches, long-term cessation rates are still below 25%. Quitline is a national smoking cessation service that offers telephone delivered behavioral support (3 sessions) and an eight-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) at a subsidized rate for smokers in NZ. The Fit2Quit trial aims to determine the effects of a home and community-based exercise intervention on increasing smoking cessation rates at six months when added to usual care. A two-arm parallel randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 2010-11. Eligible participants were recruited through Quitline who were interested in quitting, had their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking, aged 18 years and over, and wanted to be physically active. The intervention group received telephone-based exercise counseling programme delivered by existing Green Prescription (GRx) services over six months, in addition to usual smoking cessation support. The control group received usual care alone. Self-reported smoking abstinence, mood and physical symptoms (MPSS), and physical activity level (IPAQ) were assessed at 8 and 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was self-reported point-prevalence at 24 weeks, confirmed by salivary cotinine reading. Treatment evaluations were performed on the principle of intention-to-treat assuming missing as smoking. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. A total of 906 smokers were randomized (intervention N=455; control N=451). Participants were aged 37 years (18-78yrs), 31% Maori, 46% males, 83% smoked >10 cigarettes per day, 79% made previous quit attempts, and 55% didn't use NRT at baseline. Relative risk and adjusted odds ratio were calculated to assess the smoking abstinence. Repeated measures models were used to evaluate change in MPSS and IPAQ total score between groups. Statistical analyses and full trial results will be presented and discussed. Trajectory-based models are increasingly applied in clinical research to understand the etiology and developmental course of different types of disorder 1, 2, 3]. More recently, the range of applications has been extended to capture heterogeneity in treatment responses to clinical and randomized trials 4, 5]. A double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in nutrition was carried out on 197 subjects to investigate whether the consumption of an active dairy product can improve different clinical parameters, such as well-being scores. For exploratory purpose Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) 6] were used to map the developmental course of these distinct but related outcomes individually, and then according to a joint approach. The statistical analysis was performed with the Proc Traj 7] with SAS® software release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). GBTM provided empirical ways of identifying clusters of individuals in response of the product intake, following both typical and atypical courses of development. Overall, results suggested that the active product was associated with trajectories relating clinical improvements. In this application, GBTM also allowed to highlight different responders' patterns in the active product group by identifying developmentally meaningful subgroups in the population for whom product effects vary. In this communication, authors will discuss the results of applying such methods to a clinical trial in nutrition. Strengths and limits associated to this approach as well as the interpretation will be further detailed. The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study is a Phase 3, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare a moderate-intensity physical activity program to a successful aging health education program in 1,600 sedentary older persons, age 70-89 years, across eight field centers. The primary outcome is major mobility disability, defined as the inability to walk 400 meters. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include serious fall injuries, pulmonary events, and cardiovascular events. Given the number of participants and their age range, we expect to collect data on many outcomes throughout the length of the trial. The need for a central tracking and monitoring system initiated the construction of the Outcomes Management Tool (OMT). The OMT allows the Data Management and Quality Control (DMAQC) Center to centrally track status of outcomes, compile cases for assignment to adjudication committee members, and track the adjudications via an online interface system. The web system registers each outcome reported, eliminates duplicate events identified, and enables field centers and the DMAQC to track outcomes as they move through the outcomes process. Making this process accessible on the web is efficient for real-time reporting, gives administrators the ability to manage documents, assign adjudicators, monitor active adjudication status, communicate with adjudicators when needed, and provides a central repository for outcome details. Generating outcome events from participant reports begins with the data entry of a case report form (CRF). Upon submission of the CRF, if specific criteria are met, this triggers the creation of a unique outcome ID for each event reported by the participant and initiates the tracking of outcomes. This utilizes IBM's WebSphere ILOG-JRules business management system for rules validation and event provocation. This presentation will outline the flow of outcomes in the Outcomes Management Tool from the entry of the CRF to the final adjudication. Patient registries may support a variety of functions, ranging from clinical care to quality measurement and reporting, to clinical and translational research. Compared to clinical trials, quality reporting registries typically involve more data collection (all patients and all visits within a set of practices), often with fewer resources (funding, personnel). Data coordinating centers for registries must be aware of these differences, assist practices in embedding data collection into clinical care, and provide time-efficient resources for monitoring and improving data quality. To support ImproveCareNow, a quality reporting registry for pediatric IBD, we worked with an established multicenter network to standardize data definitions and review their processes of data collection and capture. Additionally, we developed a set of data quality metrics to define areas where data quality is critical to desired outcomes or known areas of deficiencies for the registry. Among the measures of interest are:- proportion of patients enrolled in the registry - proportion of visits captured in the registry - proportion of visits with all critical data elements captured - proportion of visits entered in the registry within 30 days of visit date - proportion of visits where data values are suspicious, based on inter or intra-visit inconsistencies We also developed a pair of data quality reports- a set of run charts that allow sites to track data quality metrics over time and a report that allows sites easily identify potential errors to a level of detail that allows for quick updates to be made to the registry. These reports were designed to have a look and feel similar to tools already in use by these sites to increase the probability of their integration into normal clinical practice. Analysis of the effectiveness of these strategies is ongoing. Preliminary results show an increase from 80% to 89% of visits with all critical variables recorded. One major aspect of multi-center clinical trials coordinating centers includes the work, data flow and monitoring of central units which analyze samples and transmit data to the coordinating center. These include laboratories for blood samples and reading centers for electrocardiographs, retinal photos, CT scans, DEXA scans, etc. Data travels from clinical site to collection site (e.g. scan center) to central reading center and finally to the coordinating center. It is critical to ensure the integrity of the data while streamlining the process when data collection and management can be challenging. The first step in the design process is planning the methods of participant flow from clinical site to collection site, including obtaining informed consent, verifying eligibility and participant scheduling. The second step is developing the method of data flow from collection site to reading center using tools such as web-based portals, transmission software or courier services. The third step is for the reading center to securely transfer the data to the coordinating center. Data transmissions should have preapproved formats and sets of components for consistency and accuracy such as dates of analysis and receipt, and unique identifiers for the individuals performing the analysis and the specific image or sample. The fourth step is to develop methods for data validation to ensure the correct attribution of assessment to the corresponding participant. The coordinating center should have a checklist for the incoming central unit data where the data must check and pass each step before moving to the next step. Finally, a process for the reporting of alert values to sites in a timely manner must be developed. Several options for these processes will be described and various methods in which data is collected and transferred from reading centers to coordinating centers will be compared, and future suggestions will be discussed. With the popularity of electronic data capture (EDC) increasing in clinical trials, there is a growing demand for stronger and more efficient data validation tools. Traditionally, online single field range checks and batched offline logic checks performed by statisticians are used to identify data issues related to data transcription errors and protocol compliance discrepancies. Our home-grown, web-based Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) is equipped with a database driven data validation process to perform rule-based data checks at the time of data entry. This process uses a centralized database table to manage all data validation checks for all Case Report Forms (CRFs). Initial data checks against invalid data types, missing required data items and impossible data values are performed prior to saving the record to the database. Records that pass this initial process are saved to the database and further data validation is performed by using database queries involving one or more related data items to ensure sound data collection logic is enforced. Depending on the sources of these data items, such data validation queries can be defined within the current data record, across multiple records within the same data table, or across multiple records from different data tables. Violations of these data checks will be saved in a central rule violation table along with the values of the associated data items. Based on the level of the violation, an alert, warning, or rejection flag will be placed on the data form as an indicator for users to take the next appropriate action. Our data management experiences for more than ten large, multi-center phase III clinical trials demonstrated that this comprehensive, real-time data validation function has significantly reduced data errors occurring during the data entry process and shortened the time required for data cleaning and database lock. Background: Source data verification is the process of comparing information on source records to data recorded in a Case Report Form as part of a research study. Researchers are required to perform source data verification in order to comply with National Regulations and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. There is little guidance for researchers as to the amount and frequency of this process or the effect of source data verification on study outcomes. Recently there has been debate regarding the value of source data verification on data quality. There is little research on the beliefs and attitudes of Investigators and Research Coordinators regarding the amount, frequency, value and effect of source data verification and how it may be optimized. This project is part of a research program to determine the effect of source data verification on study outcomes and the amount of source data verification that should be done. Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the current beliefs and attitudes regarding source data verification of members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group. Methods: We developed a self-administered on-line survey using focus groups of Critical Care Investigators and Research Coordinators. The survey has been pilot tested and is undergoing clinical sensibility and reliability testing. The final survey will be sent electronically to the 330 members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group between December 2011 and February 2011. Results: We will present descriptive summaries for all items and then separately for Investigator and Research Coordinator groups. We will evaluate associations between variables. Significance: The survey results will provide general guidance to adult and pediatric critical care researchers in determining data quality assurance procedures and will inform the next phase of the research program: assessing methods of source data verification and its effect on study outcomes in Canadian Critical Care research. The concept of reproducible research was introduced in the computational sciences some time ago, but has begun to be considered in biostatistics, bioinformatic, and other areas of medically related data analysis. Reproducible research, in this context, involves performing data analysis and statistical evaluation of data in a manner in which the relevant results (tables, figures, incidental text) can be recovered with minimal effort, analyses can be conveyed to data repositories with minimal effort, and analyses can survive the inevitable changes in personnel at the data management center. This has strong implications for clinical trials, which are usually conducted in a "reproducible research" concept, but which are not always analyzed in this manner. From the perspective of data analysis in SAS (a dominant tool in the clinical trials field), structural approaches to project setup, disciplined and consistent uses of macros, and archival approaches to manuscript construction are the first steps to reproducible research. These will be discussed and illustrated with several examples. The use of technology in clinical trials is increasing where ancillary software is utilized to capture data beyond that typically collected via case report forms in an electronic data capture (EDC) system. In recent studies by the Clinical Trials Network of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, software systems have been used to administer and monitor adherence to trial interventions and perform study assessments. Utilization of ancillary systems requires appropriate advanced planning to address key issues. Ancillary systems vary in complexity and sophistication, ranging from simple and home-grown to complex and well-validated. Upon identifying systems deemed necessary for the trial, a communication plan should be developed outlining expectations for software developer support, as well as the workflow and timeline for identifying and resolving issues. The software and hardware needed for hosting and using the system must be identified and procured. Understanding the structure of the data collected in the system, which is facilitated by obtaining a system diagram and data dictionary, is key. If the system will be used to capture data for analysis, it is important to verify that those data are collected and identifiable in the system. The data dictionary can assist in identifying if protected health information is being collected and if so, to develop appropriate security measures, such as encryption. It is also important to explore whether the system can communicate with the EDC system, or at a minimum that the data captured in the system can be linked to those from the EDC system. Finally, a plan for providing initial and ongoing training in the use of the system must be established. The plan should outline who is responsible for the training, the method of training (e.g., face-to-face, webcast), and the development of a user's guide. Despite best practice guidelines, patients presenting for primary care are often not screened for medical issues other than the presenting problem due to time and personnel constraints. This presentation details an electronic screening protocol and technology platform that: a) allows patients to complete a brief screening form prior to their appointment, and b) provides immediate feedback on health risks and conditions for clinicians to use in the patient visit. Patients presenting at the primary care clinic self report via a Comprehensive Primary Care Screening (CPCS) instrument using Android-based tablets. The CPCS assesses risks related to falls, colon cancer, sexual health, domestic violence, oral health, alcohol, depression, and basic needs. Responses are entered via a touch-screen interface in English or Spanish, or via audio versions of the instrument. It incorporates dynamic branch logic to capture detailed information where needed from patients. Upon completion, data is saved into a EDC database where it is scored and analyzed for recommendations, including referrals and standing orders. Results are immediately accessible for physician use; scores and raw data may also be extracted for incorporation into de-identified research datasets. We use a CDISC ODM-based form definition created using the OpenClinica open source EDC platform. The CDISC ODM protocol and data capture definitions are automatically transformed into to XForm definitions that are rendered via an open source medical data capture "app" on the tablets for patient entry and physician retrieval. The EDC engine provides data storage, validation, scoring, reporting, and analysis capability. The project objectives are to: - increase referrals for health risks and conditions, - increase access to and use of de-identified screening results by researchers, and - promote adoption, dissemination, and adaptation of the screening tool by using reusable, configurable open source platform. The methods for data capture have advanced as technology has evolved. Often studies utilize an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, but many studies may still only be paper based. The costs and regulatory requirements of deploying an EDC system may not outweigh the benefits of conducting a paper based study through the use of fax forms, scanning optical character recognition software, telephone data entry, bubble forms, or digital pen capture. However, these methods are thought of as "old technology," but with the proper technical approach, a paper based study may actually be more efficient and productive. A model project was conducted in which digital pen data collection technology was examined for benefits and drawbacks. The digital pen was used by study staff members and/or subjects to complete CRFs, the pen is docked in a docking station attached to a computer, and data is uploaded to the data coordinating center. After project evaluation, it was found that the use of digital pen technology to instantly generate electronic copies of paper CRFs benefited the study by:eliminating the need to ship completed CRFs,eliminating the need to scan paper forms for electronic storage and transmission,dramatically reducing data collection training for staff,using a source document as a CRF, andhaving the ability to track CRF completion virtually. While there are multiple ways to implement digital pen technology, each with their own drawbacks, this project found that data still had to be entered into an electronic database manually, printing CRFs required using print vendors with previous experience with the software, and a method to transfer and track files and store back-up copies was needed. These lessons learned will only benefit future studies using digital pen technology corporately, and help reduce Sponsor costs for paper based studies. The technology of personal computing has undergone great changes the last few years. Naturally, those conducting clinical research would like to take advantage of these advancements. The Clinical Research Database (CRDB) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) was created as a client server application in 1992. In 2003, the first web based platform was made available to facilitate data entry from remote locations. During the past year, it became necessary to expand our application scope to keep up with the latest needs of the researchers. There are two main areas of our system expansion: 1) the multicenter internet platform and 2) mobile devices. Historically at MSKCC, data management for our multicenter protocols was mainly a paper based system. It became evident that participating sites needed access to CRDB to enter data directly. This brought about security and privacy concerns beyond what was needed for an internal database. The conversion to a new external platform to deal with these concerns brought its own set of challenges. In parallel, a mobile option was needed for survey completion by participants in clinic because desktop computers are not always available. However, CRDB was designed for data entry by clinical research professionals, not participants. We were able to design a tablet survey that addressed this as well as other concerns. In this presentation, we will review the need for alternative platforms for collecting clinical research data. We will also address the various challenges we faced while expanding our system from the traditional data entry model, as well as our suggested solutions. Clinical outcomes are an important component of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and are often used to complement patient reported outcome measures such as health-related quality of life. Although clinical outcomes were traditionally collected through clinical examination or laboratory results, routine data sources and self-reporting by patients are increasingly used. We examined four RCTs that collected patient reported clinical outcomes through postal questionnaires. In each RCT the patient reported clinical outcome was verified using either medical records, routine data sources or by contacting the patient's family doctor or hospital physician to ascertain the accuracy. The accuracy of patient reporting of clinical outcomes is dependent on a number of factors including the nature and timing of the clinical outcome and the phrasing of the clinical questions. For example, it may be easier for a patient to report a knee-related hospital re-admission than self-report a urinary tract infection. Nevertheless, approximately 15% of patient reported knee- related hospital re-admissions (collected through annual postal questionnaires) could not be verified through routine data sources and/or medical records. Such inconsistencies were shown to be a combination of misunderstanding by the patient and inaccuracies of the routine data sets. Obtaining clinical information from patients is feasible, especially if the outcome of interest is a symptomatic one. However with the potential inaccuracies associated with patient reporting of clinical outcomes, it may be necessary to consider verifying such outcomes with medical professionals and/or routine data sources. Such a strategy has implications in terms of staff time and cost and therefore has to be considered during the design stage of the RCT. We will discuss some challenges and inconsistencies between self-reporting and medically confirmed clinical outcomes. We will highlight processes involved in verifying patient reported clinical outcomes and how adopting such a verification strategy may impact on the overall trial results. Background: The availability of platforms and devices for electronic data capture has been a major step forward for the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical trials. The advantages of electronic PROs include real-time tracking of compliance, automated patient reminders, and date-time data for individual assessments. Multiple modes of ePRO data capture (e.g. PC/tablet, handheld, automated phone survey) allow flexibility in clinical trial design. This has raised the question of whether use of multiple modes in a single trial might affect statistical power. Methods: We review the growing body of research on the measurement reliability across modes, and estimate the effect on statistical power in several common PRO endpoint analyses. We consider this effect compared to other common and PRO-related threats to power. Results: Peer-reviewed studies indicate the measurement reliability across modes of administration is high (approx 0.90) and consistent with the test-retest reliability of individual modes. We have calculated that even if measurement reliability were more moderate (0.70 - 0.80), effects on statistical power would be small. The estimated reduction in statistical power from using multiple modes of data collection is dwarfed by the estimated loss of power associated with missing data (which can be prevented by allowing a second mode as alternate or backup). The threat of multiple modes to power is also far less than mis-estimation of variance in sample size calculation or use of PRO measures with low responsiveness. Conclusions: Very small reductions in measurement reliability from the use of multiple modes of ePRO are outweighed by the advantage of data completeness. To preserve power in clinical trials, researchers would be better off focusing on well-established areas of methodologic concern, such as accurate estimation of variance and choice of responsive outcome measures. Suppose a limited number (N) of patients is available for study and the traditional randomized trial design comparing 'standard' to 'new' is not feasible. This work was motivated by an interest in comparing two treatments for recurrent Wilm's tumor, where about 40% of patients are event-free long- term with standard treatment. One option is a study design which seeks to maximize the number of study subjects receiving the better treatment. Consider a design for which n1/2 patients are randomized to each of 2 treatments and then time-to-event is compared using the log-rank test. All remaining (N-n1) patients are then assigned treatment 1 (treatment 2) based on whether the log-rank test is positive (negative). We assumed an available sample size of 100. For exponential failure-time distributions with a baseline ? of 0.50 to 0.75, and for a range of relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80, the design which maximized the number of subjects receiving the better treatment was to randomize about 40 patients (having observed about 20% of the total expected information) and then assign the remaining 60 patients to the regimen with the better observed outcome. We hypothesized that, in other settings, the n1 corresponding to observing about 20% of the expected information would be optimal. We ran simulation studies assuming a cure model outcome: S(t) = 0.4 + (0.6)*exp(- 0.75t). We simulated studies of 100 patients, with n1 values from 20 to 80 and cure rate increases corresponding to relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80. The number of study subjects receiving the better treatment was maximized at an n1 value of 40-45 (corresponding to 17- 20% of the total expected number of events). In non-inferiority (NI) trials, the evaluation of the efficacy of a new experimental treatment allows for some defined level of reduced effect as compared to an active control standard. Serial use of NI trials may lead to erosion in the level of improvement provided by newly approved therapies; this phenomenon is called 'bio-creep'. Simulations were designed to facilitate understanding of bio-creep risk when approval of a new treatment with efficacy less than some proportion of the effect of the active control treatment would constitute harm, such as sulfonamides or penicillin for treatment of Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia. In this setting, risk of approval of insufficiently effective therapies may be great, even when the standard treatment effect is 'constant' across trials. Among the many possible factors contributing to this manifestation of bio-creep, the most influential were the method for selecting the active control, the choice of non-inferiority margin, and bias in the active control effect estimate. Therefore, when non-inferiority testing is performed, margins should be based upon the estimated effect of the active control, should account for the variability and for likely sources of bias in this estimate, and should address the importance of preservation of some portion of the effect of the standard. Purpose: This study demonstrates how errors in estimating the SD of a population can lead to inaccurate sample sizes and underpowered studies, and offers recommendations for maximizing the likelihood of achieving adequate statistical power. Results: Our simulated data show that greater sample size provides a more reliable estimate of the SD of the population than a smaller one. All minimal and 25th percentile sample SDs fell below 44 (the population SD) no matter how big the sampling sample size (from 2 to 100). For samples sizes 10 and 100, the minimum sample SDs underestimate the population SD by 47.1% (44 - 23.27] / 44) and 18.3% (44 35.93] / 44), respectively. For all sample sizes below 40, the mean sample SDs fell below the population SD; for sample sizes of 40 or greater, the mean sample SDs were close to the population SD. All maximum and 75th percentile sample SDs exceeded the population SD. Based on a published underpowered trial (n1=13, n2=17 and power 41,000 patients) were included (Figure 1). Based on RCTs, TXA was associated with a reduced risk of death versus aprotinin, while pairwise comparisons were inconclusive for MI, stroke, and renal failure/dysfunction; point estimates and coverage probabilities of these intervals suggested aprotinin was often associated with an elevated probability of increased risk (Table 1). When observational data were incorporated, pairwise comparisons showed increased risks of death with aprotinin relative to TXA and EACA, as well an increased risk of renal failure/dysfunction relative to all comparators. There were also probabilities suggestive of increased risks of MI with aprotinin compared to TXA and EACA (Table 1). Conclusions: Data suggests there remains reason for concern regarding aprotinin safety. While meta-analyses of RCTs can lack sufficient sample size to definitively identify harms imbalances, appropriate incorporation of observational evidence and use of network meta-analysis can help reduce uncertainty in analyses of such data. The success of translational research requires sound judgment in the planning and implementation of trials. Such planning involves synthesis of previous literature. We sought to determine the accessibility of preclinical efficacy studies in a cohort of novel investigational agents entering clinical development between 2000 and 2003. A cohort of initial human trials of new agents reported as full journal publications was identified through systematic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE. The cohort included 100 investigational agents, spanning 10 different indications. Identified agents were linked to preclinical studies by a search of references, EMBASE and PubMed. Preclinical evidence was considered published if at least one full journal article reported disease response in live, non-human animals. Of the 100 agents, 89 had published preclinical work, 80 of which tested the identical intervention and another 9 of which were based on closely related agents. Thirteen percent of agents published preclinical studies only after the initial human trial publication. Fifty-five percent of initial human trial articles referenced published animal work. Of the 89 agents, 57% had five or more animal studies available, 33% had between 2-4, and 10% had one preclinical study available. Of the 13 investigational agents that received eventual FDA approval, 12 had five or more preclinical studies available in the published record. The probability that preclinical evidence was publicly reported in more than five reports was significantly greater for FDA approved drugs than for drugs that did not receive licensure (85% vs. 38%; Yates' chi-squared test, p=0.002). This work demonstrates that a large proportion of investigational agents had at least some preclinical studies available. This suggests that preclinical knowledge synthesis for many new drugs is feasible--especially for those receiving licensure. However, we are unable to estimate what proportion of preclinical efficacy studies go unpublished. Smoking is directly responsible for 4500 deaths each year in New Zealand (NZ) including 22% of all Maori deaths. Despite the proven efficacy of various cessation approaches, long-term cessation rates are still below 25%. Quitline is a national smoking cessation service that offers telephone delivered behavioral support (3 sessions) and an eight-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) at a subsidized rate for smokers in NZ. The Fit2Quit trial aims to determine the effects of a home and community-based exercise intervention on increasing smoking cessation rates at six months when added to usual care. A two-arm parallel randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 2010-11. Eligible participants were recruited through Quitline who were interested in quitting, had their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking, aged 18 years and over, and wanted to be physically active. The intervention group received telephone-based exercise counseling programme delivered by existing Green Prescription (GRx) services over six months, in addition to usual smoking cessation support. The control group received usual care alone. Self-reported smoking abstinence, mood and physical symptoms (MPSS), and physical activity level (IPAQ) were assessed at 8 and 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was self-reported point-prevalence at 24 weeks, confirmed by salivary cotinine reading. Treatment evaluations were performed on the principle of intention-to-treat assuming missing as smoking. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. A total of 906 smokers were randomized (intervention N=455; control N=451). Participants were aged 37 years (18-78yrs), 31% Maori, 46% males, 83% smoked >10 cigarettes per day, 79% made previous quit attempts, and 55% didn't use NRT at baseline. Relative risk and adjusted odds ratio were calculated to assess the smoking abstinence. Repeated measures models were used to evaluate change in MPSS and IPAQ total score between groups. Statistical analyses and full trial results will be presented and discussed. Trajectory-based models are increasingly applied in clinical research to understand the etiology and developmental course of different types of disorder 1, 2, 3]. More recently, the range of applications has been extended to capture heterogeneity in treatment responses to clinical and randomized trials 4, 5]. A double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in nutrition was carried out on 197 subjects to investigate whether the consumption of an active dairy product can improve different clinical parameters, such as well-being scores. For exploratory purpose Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) 6] were used to map the developmental course of these distinct but related outcomes individually, and then according to a joint approach. The statistical analysis was performed with the Proc Traj 7] with SAS® software release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). GBTM provided empirical ways of identifying clusters of individuals in response of the product intake, following both typical and atypical courses of development. Overall, results suggested that the active product was associated with trajectories relating clinical improvements. In this application, GBTM also allowed to highlight different responders' patterns in the active product group by identifying developmentally meaningful subgroups in the population for whom product effects vary. In this communication, authors will discuss the results of applying such methods to a clinical trial in nutrition. Strengths and limits associated to this approach as well as the interpretation will be further detailed. The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study is a Phase 3, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare a moderate-intensity physical activity program to a successful aging health education program in 1,600 sedentary older persons, age 70-89 years, across eight field centers. The primary outcome is major mobility disability, defined as the inability to walk 400 meters. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include serious fall injuries, pulmonary events, and cardiovascular events. Given the number of participants and their age range, we expect to collect data on many outcomes throughout the length of the trial. The need for a central tracking and monitoring system initiated the construction of the Outcomes Management Tool (OMT). The OMT allows the Data Management and Quality Control (DMAQC) Center to centrally track status of outcomes, compile cases for assignment to adjudication committee members, and track the adjudications via an online interface system. The web system registers each outcome reported, eliminates duplicate events identified, and enables field centers and the DMAQC to track outcomes as they move through the outcomes process. Making this process accessible on the web is efficient for real-time reporting, gives administrators the ability to manage documents, assign adjudicators, monitor active adjudication status, communicate with adjudicators when needed, and provides a central repository for outcome details. Generating outcome events from participant reports begins with the data entry of a case report form (CRF). Upon submission of the CRF, if specific criteria are met, this triggers the creation of a unique outcome ID for each event reported by the participant and initiates the tracking of outcomes. This utilizes IBM's WebSphere ILOG-JRules business management system for rules validation and event provocation. This presentation will outline the flow of outcomes in the Outcomes Management Tool from the entry of the CRF to the final adjudication. Patient registries may support a variety of functions, ranging from clinical care to quality measurement and reporting, to clinical and translational research. Compared to clinical trials, quality reporting registries typically involve more data collection (all patients and all visits within a set of practices), often with fewer resources (funding, personnel). Data coordinating centers for registries must be aware of these differences, assist practices in embedding data collection into clinical care, and provide time-efficient resources for monitoring and improving data quality. To support ImproveCareNow, a quality reporting registry for pediatric IBD, we worked with an established multicenter network to standardize data definitions and review their processes of data collection and capture. Additionally, we developed a set of data quality metrics to define areas where data quality is critical to desired outcomes or known areas of deficiencies for the registry. Among the measures of interest are:- proportion of patients enrolled in the registry - proportion of visits captured in the registry - proportion of visits with all critical data elements captured - proportion of visits entered in the registry within 30 days of visit date - proportion of visits where data values are suspicious, based on inter or intra-visit inconsistencies We also developed a pair of data quality reports- a set of run charts that allow sites to track data quality metrics over time and a report that allows sites easily identify potential errors to a level of detail that allows for quick updates to be made to the registry. These reports were designed to have a look and feel similar to tools already in use by these sites to increase the probability of their integration into normal clinical practice. Analysis of the effectiveness of these strategies is ongoing. Preliminary results show an increase from 80% to 89% of visits with all critical variables recorded. One major aspect of multi-center clinical trials coordinating centers includes the work, data flow and monitoring of central units which analyze samples and transmit data to the coordinating center. These include laboratories for blood samples and reading centers for electrocardiographs, retinal photos, CT scans, DEXA scans, etc. Data travels from clinical site to collection site (e.g. scan center) to central reading center and finally to the coordinating center. It is critical to ensure the integrity of the data while streamlining the process when data collection and management can be challenging. The first step in the design process is planning the methods of participant flow from clinical site to collection site, including obtaining informed consent, verifying eligibility and participant scheduling. The second step is developing the method of data flow from collection site to reading center using tools such as web-based portals, transmission software or courier services. The third step is for the reading center to securely transfer the data to the coordinating center. Data transmissions should have preapproved formats and sets of components for consistency and accuracy such as dates of analysis and receipt, and unique identifiers for the individuals performing the analysis and the specific image or sample. The fourth step is to develop methods for data validation to ensure the correct attribution of assessment to the corresponding participant. The coordinating center should have a checklist for the incoming central unit data where the data must check and pass each step before moving to the next step. Finally, a process for the reporting of alert values to sites in a timely manner must be developed. Several options for these processes will be described and various methods in which data is collected and transferred from reading centers to coordinating centers will be compared, and future suggestions will be discussed. With the popularity of electronic data capture (EDC) increasing in clinical trials, there is a growing demand for stronger and more efficient data validation tools. Traditionally, online single field range checks and batched offline logic checks performed by statisticians are used to identify data issues related to data transcription errors and protocol compliance discrepancies. Our home-grown, web-based Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) is equipped with a database driven data validation process to perform rule-based data checks at the time of data entry. This process uses a centralized database table to manage all data validation checks for all Case Report Forms (CRFs). Initial data checks against invalid data types, missing required data items and impossible data values are performed prior to saving the record to the database. Records that pass this initial process are saved to the database and further data validation is performed by using database queries involving one or more related data items to ensure sound data collection logic is enforced. Depending on the sources of these data items, such data validation queries can be defined within the current data record, across multiple records within the same data table, or across multiple records from different data tables. Violations of these data checks will be saved in a central rule violation table along with the values of the associated data items. Based on the level of the violation, an alert, warning, or rejection flag will be placed on the data form as an indicator for users to take the next appropriate action. Our data management experiences for more than ten large, multi-center phase III clinical trials demonstrated that this comprehensive, real-time data validation function has significantly reduced data errors occurring during the data entry process and shortened the time required for data cleaning and database lock. Background: Source data verification is the process of comparing information on source records to data recorded in a Case Report Form as part of a research study. Researchers are required to perform source data verification in order to comply with National Regulations and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. There is little guidance for researchers as to the amount and frequency of this process or the effect of source data verification on study outcomes. Recently there has been debate regarding the value of source data verification on data quality. There is little research on the beliefs and attitudes of Investigators and Research Coordinators regarding the amount, frequency, value and effect of source data verification and how it may be optimized. This project is part of a research program to determine the effect of source data verification on study outcomes and the amount of source data verification that should be done. Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the current beliefs and attitudes regarding source data verification of members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group. Methods: We developed a self-administered on-line survey using focus groups of Critical Care Investigators and Research Coordinators. The survey has been pilot tested and is undergoing clinical sensibility and reliability testing. The final survey will be sent electronically to the 330 members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group between December 2011 and February 2011. Results: We will present descriptive summaries for all items and then separately for Investigator and Research Coordinator groups. We will evaluate associations between variables. Significance: The survey results will provide general guidance to adult and pediatric critical care researchers in determining data quality assurance procedures and will inform the next phase of the research program: assessing methods of source data verification and its effect on study outcomes in Canadian Critical Care research. The concept of reproducible research was introduced in the computational sciences some time ago, but has begun to be considered in biostatistics, bioinformatic, and other areas of medically related data analysis. Reproducible research, in this context, involves performing data analysis and statistical evaluation of data in a manner in which the relevant results (tables, figures, incidental text) can be recovered with minimal effort, analyses can be conveyed to data repositories with minimal effort, and analyses can survive the inevitable changes in personnel at the data management center. This has strong implications for clinical trials, which are usually conducted in a "reproducible research" concept, but which are not always analyzed in this manner. From the perspective of data analysis in SAS (a dominant tool in the clinical trials field), structural approaches to project setup, disciplined and consistent uses of macros, and archival approaches to manuscript construction are the first steps to reproducible research. These will be discussed and illustrated with several examples. The use of technology in clinical trials is increasing where ancillary software is utilized to capture data beyond that typically collected via case report forms in an electronic data capture (EDC) system.

Utilization of ancillary systems requires appropriate advanced planning to address key issues. Ancillary systems vary in complexity and sophistication, ranging from simple and home-grown to complex and well-validated.

Understanding the structure of the data collected in the system, which is facilitated by obtaining a system diagram and data dictionary, is key. If the system will be used to capture data for analysis, it is important to verify that those data are collected and identifiable in the system. The data dictionary can assist in identifying if protected health information is being collected and if so, to develop appropriate security measures, such as encryption. It is also important to explore whether the system can communicate with the EDC system, or at a minimum that the data captured in the system can be linked to those from the EDC system. Finally, a plan for providing initial and ongoing training in the use of the system must be established. The plan should outline who is responsible for the training, the method of training (e.g., face-to-face, webcast), and the development of a user's guide.

The accuracy of patient reporting of clinical outcomes is dependent on a number of factors including the nature and timing of the clinical outcome and the phrasing of the clinical questions. For example, it may be easier for a patient to report a knee-related hospital re-admission than self-report a urinary tract infection. Nevertheless, approximately 15% of patient reported knee- related hospital re-admissions (collected through annual postal questionnaires) could not be verified through routine data sources and/or medical records. Such inconsistencies were shown to be a combination of misunderstanding by the patient and inaccuracies of the routine data sets. Obtaining clinical information from patients is feasible, especially if the outcome of interest is a symptomatic one. However with the potential inaccuracies associated with patient reporting of clinical outcomes, it may be necessary to consider verifying such outcomes with medical professionals and/or routine data sources. Such a strategy has implications in terms of staff time and cost and therefore has to be considered during the design stage of the RCT. We will discuss some challenges and inconsistencies between self-reporting and medically confirmed clinical outcomes. We will highlight processes involved in verifying patient reported clinical outcomes and how adopting such a verification strategy may impact on the overall trial results. Background: The availability of platforms and devices for electronic data capture has been a major step forward for the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical trials. The advantages of electronic PROs include real-time tracking of compliance, automated patient reminders, and date-time data for individual assessments. Multiple modes of ePRO data capture (e.g. PC/tablet, handheld, automated phone survey) allow flexibility in clinical trial design. This has raised the question of whether use of multiple modes in a single trial might affect statistical power. Methods: We review the growing body of research on the measurement reliability across modes, and estimate the effect on statistical power in several common PRO endpoint analyses. We consider this effect compared to other common and PRO-related threats to power. Results: Peer-reviewed studies indicate the measurement reliability across modes of administration is high (approx 0.90) and consistent with the test-retest reliability of individual modes. We have calculated that even if measurement reliability were more moderate (0.70 - 0.80), effects on statistical power would be small. The estimated reduction in statistical power from using multiple modes of data collection is dwarfed by the estimated loss of power associated with missing data (which can be prevented by allowing a second mode as alternate or backup). The threat of multiple modes to power is also far less than mis-estimation of variance in sample size calculation or use of PRO measures with low responsiveness. Conclusions: Very small reductions in measurement reliability from the use of multiple modes of ePRO are outweighed by the advantage of data completeness. To preserve power in clinical trials, researchers would be better off focusing on well-established areas of methodologic concern, such as accurate estimation of variance and choice of responsive outcome measures. Suppose a limited number (N) of patients is available for study and the traditional randomized trial design comparing 'standard' to 'new' is not feasible. This work was motivated by an interest in comparing two treatments for recurrent Wilm's tumor, where about 40% of patients are event-free long- term with standard treatment. One option is a study design which seeks to maximize the number of study subjects receiving the better treatment. Consider a design for which n1/2 patients are randomized to each of 2 treatments and then time-to-event is compared using the log-rank test. All remaining (N-n1) patients are then assigned treatment 1 (treatment 2) based on whether the log-rank test is positive (negative). We assumed an available sample size of 100. For exponential failure-time distributions with a baseline ? of 0.50 to 0.75, and for a range of relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80, the design which maximized the number of subjects receiving the better treatment was to randomize about 40 patients (having observed about 20% of the total expected information) and then assign the remaining 60 patients to the regimen with the better observed outcome. We hypothesized that, in other settings, the n1 corresponding to observing about 20% of the expected information would be optimal. We ran simulation studies assuming a cure model outcome: S(t) = 0.4 + (0.6)*exp(- 0.75t). We simulated studies of 100 patients, with n1 values from 20 to 80 and cure rate increases corresponding to relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80. The number of study subjects receiving the better treatment was maximized at an n1 value of 40-45 (corresponding to 17- 20% of the total expected number of events). In non-inferiority (NI) trials, the evaluation of the efficacy of a new experimental treatment allows for some defined level of reduced effect as compared to an active control standard. Serial use of NI trials may lead to erosion in the level of improvement provided by newly approved therapies; this phenomenon is called 'bio-creep'. Simulations were designed to facilitate understanding of bio-creep risk when approval of a new treatment with efficacy less than some proportion of the effect of the active control treatment would constitute harm, such as sulfonamides or penicillin for treatment of Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia. In this setting, risk of approval of insufficiently effective therapies may be great, even when the standard treatment effect is 'constant' across trials. Among the many possible factors contributing to this manifestation of bio-creep, the most influential were the method for selecting the active control, the choice of non-inferiority margin, and bias in the active control effect estimate. Therefore, when non-inferiority testing is performed, margins should be based upon the estimated effect of the active control, should account for the variability and for likely sources of bias in this estimate, and should address the importance of preservation of some portion of the effect of the standard. Purpose: This study demonstrates how errors in estimating the SD of a population can lead to inaccurate sample sizes and underpowered studies, and offers recommendations for maximizing the likelihood of achieving adequate statistical power. Results: Our simulated data show that greater sample size provides a more reliable estimate of the SD of the population than a smaller one. All minimal and 25th percentile sample SDs fell below 44 (the population SD) no matter how big the sampling sample size (from 2 to 100). For samples sizes 10 and 100, the minimum sample SDs underestimate the population SD by 47.1% (44 - 23.27] / 44) and 18.3% (44 35.93] / 44), respectively. For all sample sizes below 40, the mean sample SDs fell below the population SD; for sample sizes of 40 or greater, the mean sample SDs were close to the population SD. All maximum and 75th percentile sample SDs exceeded the population SD. Based on a published underpowered trial (n1=13, n2=17 and power 500/uL and were referred to the National Institutes of Health for further testing. Of the 41 referred patients, 33 (80.4%) had positive Strongyloides stercoralis-specific serology. Nine of these 33 (27%) also had schistosomiasis (n=6) or hookworm (n=3) infection. Although there was no statistical difference (p=0.15) in the baseline eosinophil levels between those with strongyloidiasis and those without, serum IgE levels differed dramatically between the two groups (geometric mean levels 74 U/ml vs. 566 IU/ml, p500/uL and were referred to the National Institutes of Health for further testing. Of the 41 referred patients, 33 (80.4%) had positive Strongyloides stercoralis-specific serology. Nine of these 33 (27%) also had schistosomiasis (n=6) or hookworm (n=3) infection. Although there was no statistical difference (p=0.15) in the baseline eosinophil levels between those with strongyloidiasis and those without, serum IgE levels differed dramatically between the two groups (geometric mean levels 74 U/ml vs. 566 IU/ml, p 48hr) without increasing risk to the mother. Women eligible for CHIPS are high risk from perinatal and maternal perspectives, such as serious neonatal complications (16%), admission to high level neonatal care (30%), pre-eclampsia (35%), or serious maternal complications (2-3%). We needed to further develop our method of SUE review to prevent anticipated outcomes from being sent to our Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for review as SUEs. In CHIPS, reported SUEs are reviewed by the Working Group (WG) to determine both the urgency of further review and what supporting documents are required. The Outcomes Adjudication Committee (OAC) reviews each SUE to determine whether the event is a pre- specified trial outcome or a 'true' SUE. This decision is reviewed by the Steering Committee (SC). A summary report is submitted to the DSMB at the interim and final analyses or immediately, as decided by the WG, OAC, and/or SC. To date in CHIPS, three SUEs have been reported, all of which were determined to be pre-specified outcomes and will be reviewed by the DSMB at the time of the first interim analysis. The T1DGC was an international effort to identify genes that determine risk of type 1 diabetes. The Consortium created a resource of 2,836 affected sibling pair families as well as 493 trios, 830 cases and 968 controls worldwide. Data and sample collection was conducted in four networks (Asia-Pacific, European, North American and United Kingdom) from January 2004 - January 2010, with support from a Coordinating Center for various activities. While implementing standardized data collection for this international study presented many challenges, study closure proved to be as formidable. Disassembling this complex infrastructure (composed of 214 clinics in 34 countries, four Network Centers and 17 laboratories) while preparing all data and samples for transfer to the NIDDK Central Repository proved as difficult and required as much effort as initiating the study. At the time that we started study closure activities, there were no established guidelines or experience to direct our actions or identify potential difficulties. Study close out was staggered, beginning in October 2006 and concluding in December 2011. We developed a clinic close-out data entry form, delineating key elements required for closure. Additionally, comprehensive checklists of closure tasks for laboratories and Network Centers were developed and utilized. Finally, the Coordinating Center held a meeting with the NIDDK Central Repository to outline the data, samples and study documentation to be deposited. By clearly defining close-out tasks, providing timelines, and performing close-out site visits and/or conference calls, staff at each facility can understand their responsibilities and ensure that all items are completed in this lengthy and complex process. Implementing these steps permits an orderly and efficient study closure and should be undertaken as soon as data collection has been initiated. We will present our procedures and solutions to problems encountered to assist other studies in the close-out process. Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products (CTIMPs) are regulated in the UK via the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. This is implemented via a) Research Ethics Committee (REC) review, b) Research Management & Governance review by the NIHR Clinical Research Networks followed by c) local Trust R&D department review, and d) Competent Authority (CA) review. Non-CTIMPs are approved via the same routes (excluding CA review). However, these studies are not governed by the Clinical Trial Regulations; instead they are conducted in line with the UK Department of Health's Research Governance Framework, and in accordance with the Medical Research Council's Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Robust processes to ensure ethical and governance compliance are implemented but we have observed that low-risk non-CTIMP trials are subject to high levels of scrutiny by RECs and R&D departments, which is not necessarily commensurate with the risk to participants. This can detract from addressing key logistical issues associated with trial implementation (e.g. clinician training, optimising complex data collection processes from many sources), and can considerably extend the set-up phase of such trials, delay the start of recruitment, and even discourage site and patient participation. It is apparent that the measurement of risk in non-CTIMP trials needs to include the risk to the participant per se, but also the complexity of trial conduct (which impacts on participant risk if processes for implementing the trial are not thoroughly planned). We will discuss the risk to the participant and the complexity of trial conduct identified in 3 complex intervention trials co-ordinated by the CTRU, and present the impact this had on the set-up and implementation of each trial. We will present a risk-based approach for review and implementation of complex intervention trials, based on the type of intervention, participant, patient pathways and outcome measures to be used. Response rates of patient reported outcome measures administered postally influence robustness of trial results. We aim to present ways in which postal response rates can be maximised in pragmatic trials using experience gained in the implementation of postal follow-up process for two large multi- centre randomised controlled trials within stroke - Training Caregivers after Stroke (TRACS) and Longer Term Stroke Care (LoTS care) co-ordinated by the University of Leeds' Clinical Trials Research Unit. Both trials obtain their primary outcome measures via patient self-completed measures administered postally. Follow-up procedures include a mixture of postal and telephone reminders, typically undertaken at two weekly intervals. Response rates are carefully monitored and, where necessary, amendments to the process are made and accounted for in later trials. For example in TRACS, following initial monitoring of data to enhance completeness, the team instigated the collection of the primary endpoint via a telephone interview for patients who did not return questionnaires despite earlier standard postal and telephone reminders. This process was adopted much earlier in the subsequent LoTS care trial. In addition, after the publication of a systematic review on methods to increase response rates, trial pens were enclosed with questionnaire packs. Lessons from LoTS care and TRACS led to implementation of strategies to enhance compliance in subsequent trials (e.g. sending questionnaires to participants in advance of a face-to-face interview in participants' homes) Response rates during specific postal and telephone reminder stages will be reported as well as the characteristics (such as age, gender, level of anxiety and depression) of participants responding at the different stages. Many aspects need consideration when developing follow-up response strategies. Above all, strategies need to be easily adaptable, closely monitored from the outset and any lessons learnt disseminated. OBJECTIVE: Patient recruitment in trials often takes longer than expected. This is costly and if the sample size remains insufficient it might lead to indecisive conclusions for practice. The field of obstetrics is unique in the way that there are two patients: the mother and her baby. We aimed to identify reasons why women participated or declined participation in an RCT during or shortly after pregnancy. DESIGN: We performed a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews in women who were asked to participate in a RCT in obstetrics. We randomly selected both women who consented and those who did not for one of a set of 7 different RCT's. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed anonymously using a constant-comparative approach. Two researchers independently identified barriers and facilitators for participation. Interviews were continued until saturation was reached. RESULTS: Of 22 women approached, 20 (90%) consented to be interviewed. Respondents varied by educational level, ethnicity, geographical area, age and parity. The main motivation for trial participation was either to contribute to research, as the women were convinced of it's importance (50%) and/or preference for a treatment arm not available outside the trial (60%). Key barriers for participation in non-consenters were a negative association with the intervention (100%) and/or with randomization (45%). Fear and uncertainty, probably due to unfamiliarity with research and the feeling of being inappropriate because of unique personal characteristics, also played a role. Stress and doubt about the decision were present in both groups. CONCLUSION: Trial participation is a tough decision for most women. The final choice about participation is made intuitively, but will be influenced positively if women are well informed about the importance of research in general and the specific trial in particular. A personal, complete, well-timed dialogue may facilitate to make a balanced decision and improve trial participation. Good clinical practice (GCP) compliance is required for state of the art quality in clinical trials (CT). For HASTA trial (Hand suture vs stapling for closure of loop ileostomy) most participating centers are non-university institutions with little experience in CT. Therefore, we established a quality assurance system with on site monitoring visits and audits in all 27 centers. Based on monitoring reports, GCP violations are analyzed and their impact on patient safety and data quality is assessed. Preparation for HASTA included a 2-day investigator meeting with surgical training and individual on site initiation visits. During recruitment 48 regular on site monitoring visits were conducted. Close out visits and independent audits are currently carried out and will be finished in February 2012. Most GCP violations concerned patient informed consent (IC), although no IC was missing. 16 findings were rated major, 42 minor. Safety: 27 events were identified requiring serious adverse event reporting according to protocol. Primary endpoint needed to be corrected in 6 cases following monitoring findings. Violation of eligibility criteria were reported 4 times only. Further violations were regarding performance of trial intervention (wrong treatment group, procedure not performed according to protocol) and time window for follow-up visits. Quantitative and qualitative results of monitoring findings will be presented and compared to findings discovered by on site audits. As on site monitoring is not routinely established for investigator initiated surgical trials, relevance of monitoring and auditing for conduct of HASTA trial and validity of trial data will be discussed. Like most clinical research studies, minority enrollment rates are low in the EPR, particularly for African American males. In addition, African Americans have higher attrition rates compared with Caucasians. Therefore, in the EPR, we have employed special methods for recruiting and retaining minority subjects with varying levels of success. In this report, we will describe these methods, the lessons learned, and strategies used to improve minority recruitment and retention. These include: relationship-building with key stakeholders; capitalizing on personal and professional contacts; utilizing community "champions" and leaders; and targeting health-related and faith-based organizations/events. Success rates for the various strategies are presented by sex, age, race, and ethnicity. Objectives: During participation in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) adherence to the intervention and to other protocol requirements (e.g. visit attendance and completion of questionnaires) is essential for the production scientifically robust and clinically meaningful outcomes. Yet little is known about the issues that affect adherence during trial participation. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced adherence to research procedures by parents who were invited to enrol their infants in longitudinal RCTs aimed at allergic disease prevention. Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCT and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Parents appeared to commit to a contract in their participation in the studies. The potential to gain direct benefit from participation improved adherence to the protocol. However even when no personal benefit was obtained, parents put considerable effort into adhering. This reflected their beliefs in the worth of the RCT and the importance they placed on fulfilling the perceived contract. Staff took proactive and reactive approaches to improving adherence. This involved 'negotiating' adherence with colleagues and parents to balance manageable participation with achieving scientifically robust outcomes. Conclusion: Many factors are important in achieving optimal adherence to the intervention and other protocol requirements. Parental and staff willingness to invest considerable time and resources is essential to achieving optimal adherence. The results suggest that staff and parents considered that research participation represented a 'contract.' Maintaining an open dialogue regarding the nature of this contract helps to promote adherence in longitudinal RCTs. Objectives: Successful recruitment to clinical trials is essential for scientifically and clinically robust findings. Additionally problems with accrual results in increased trial costs and the inefficient use of resources. Yet little is known about effective recruitment to pediatric studies. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced recruitment to non-therapeutic, pediatric longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCTs and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analyzed thematically. Results: The potential value of participation had a substantial influence on recruitment. Parents considered possible benefits for their child and the scientific worth and integrity of the RCT before agreeing to participate. The possibility that participation would be mutually beneficial was relevant to parents and staff. The ability to manage the demands of participation was also important; parents delayed making a decision until they considered they could cope. The potential for participation to cause harm had a substantial influence; fathers were often more concerned about harm and placed less importance on the scientific worth of the study than mothers. Conclusion: Recruitment to non-therapeutic longitudinal RCTs in early childhood is influenced by complex inter-related factors. Holding detailed discussions with parents regarding the scientific value of the studies and the support that can be offered to improve the manageability of participation may help to promote recruitment. Mothers and fathers often appear to have different opinions about the potential for harm and benefit; holding discussions with both parents (where appropriate) may also increase recruitment. The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) is a unique resource of subjects and their DNA samples that was created to facilitate genotype-driven translational research of complex disease. EPR goals are to recruit 20,000 individuals from North Carolina, collect their blood for DNA isolation, and make these DNA samples available to scientists to screen for genetic variants in environmental response genes. Once individuals with the "genotypes-of-interest" are identified, they are invited to participate in various types of follow-up studies ranging from basic laboratory ex vivo cell phenotyping investigations to observational studies and clinical trials. Since 2005, over 15,000 subjects of diverse sex, age, race, and ethnicity have been enrolled in the EPR from clinics at local hospitals, community-based events (health fairs, health conferences, community meetings, churches, etc.) and the internet. To minimize attrition and ensure high response rates for follow-up studies, these subjects are contacted annually (through multiple mailings and phone calls) and asked to update their contact information and other basic data. Nonresponders are traced using LexisNexis® and other public databases. Using these methods, our overall attrition rate is 48hr) without increasing risk to the mother. Women eligible for CHIPS are high risk from perinatal and maternal perspectives, such as serious neonatal complications (16%), admission to high level neonatal care (30%), pre-eclampsia (35%), or serious maternal complications (2-3%).

The possibility that participation would be mutually beneficial was relevant to parents and staff. The ability to manage the demands of participation was also important; parents delayed making a decision until they considered they could cope. The potential for participation to cause harm had a substantial influence; fathers were often more concerned about harm and placed less importance on the scientific worth of the study than mothers. Conclusion: Recruitment to non-therapeutic longitudinal RCTs in early childhood is influenced by complex inter-related factors. Holding detailed discussions with parents regarding the scientific value of the studies and the support that can be offered to improve the manageability of participation may help to promote recruitment. Mothers and fathers often appear to have different opinions about the potential for harm and benefit; holding discussions with both parents (where appropriate) may also increase recruitment. The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) is a unique resource of subjects and their DNA samples that was created to facilitate genotype-driven translational research of complex disease. EPR goals are to recruit 20,000 individuals from North Carolina, collect their blood for DNA isolation, and make these DNA samples available to scientists to screen for genetic variants in environmental response genes. Once individuals with the "genotypes-of-interest" are identified, they are invited to participate in various types of follow-up studies ranging from basic laboratory ex vivo cell phenotyping investigations to observational studies and clinical trials. Since 2005, over 15,000 subjects of diverse sex, age, race, and ethnicity have been enrolled in the EPR from clinics at local hospitals, community-based events (health fairs, health conferences, community meetings, churches, etc.) and the internet. To minimize attrition and ensure high response rates for follow-up studies, these subjects are contacted annually (through multiple mailings and phone calls) and asked to update their contact information and other basic data. Nonresponders are traced using LexisNexis® and other public databases. Using these methods, our overall attrition rate is 48hr) without increasing risk to the mother. Women eligible for CHIPS are high risk from perinatal and maternal perspectives, such as serious neonatal complications (16%), admission to high level neonatal care (30%), pre-eclampsia (35%), or serious maternal complications (2-3%). We needed to further develop our method of SUE review to prevent anticipated outcomes from being sent to our Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for review as SUEs. In CHIPS, reported SUEs are reviewed by the Working Group (WG) to determine both the urgency of further review and what supporting documents are required. The Outcomes Adjudication Committee (OAC) reviews each SUE to determine whether the event is a pre- specified trial outcome or a 'true' SUE. This decision is reviewed by the Steering Committee (SC). A summary report is submitted to the DSMB at the interim and final analyses or immediately, as decided by the WG, OAC, and/or SC. To date in CHIPS, three SUEs have been reported, all of which were determined to be pre-specified outcomes and will be reviewed by the DSMB at the time of the first interim analysis. The T1DGC was an international effort to identify genes that determine risk of type 1 diabetes. The Consortium created a resource of 2,836 affected sibling pair families as well as 493 trios, 830 cases and 968 controls worldwide. Data and sample collection was conducted in four networks (Asia-Pacific, European, North American and United Kingdom) from January 2004 - January 2010, with support from a Coordinating Center for various activities. While implementing standardized data collection for this international study presented many challenges, study closure proved to be as formidable. Disassembling this complex infrastructure (composed of 214 clinics in 34 countries, four Network Centers and 17 laboratories) while preparing all data and samples for transfer to the NIDDK Central Repository proved as difficult and required as much effort as initiating the study. At the time that we started study closure activities, there were no established guidelines or experience to direct our actions or identify potential difficulties. Study close out was staggered, beginning in October 2006 and concluding in December 2011. We developed a clinic close-out data entry form, delineating key elements required for closure. Additionally, comprehensive checklists of closure tasks for laboratories and Network Centers were developed and utilized. Finally, the Coordinating Center held a meeting with the NIDDK Central Repository to outline the data, samples and study documentation to be deposited. By clearly defining close-out tasks, providing timelines, and performing close-out site visits and/or conference calls, staff at each facility can understand their responsibilities and ensure that all items are completed in this lengthy and complex process. Implementing these steps permits an orderly and efficient study closure and should be undertaken as soon as data collection has been initiated. We will present our procedures and solutions to problems encountered to assist other studies in the close-out process. Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products (CTIMPs) are regulated in the UK via the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. This is implemented via a) Research Ethics Committee (REC) review, b) Research Management & Governance review by the NIHR Clinical Research Networks followed by c) local Trust R&D department review, and d) Competent Authority (CA) review. Non-CTIMPs are approved via the same routes (excluding CA review). However, these studies are not governed by the Clinical Trial Regulations; instead they are conducted in line with the UK Department of Health's Research Governance Framework, and in accordance with the Medical Research Council's Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Robust processes to ensure ethical and governance compliance are implemented but we have observed that low-risk non-CTIMP trials are subject to high levels of scrutiny by RECs and R&D departments, which is not necessarily commensurate with the risk to participants. This can detract from addressing key logistical issues associated with trial implementation (e.g. clinician training, optimising complex data collection processes from many sources), and can considerably extend the set-up phase of such trials, delay the start of recruitment, and even discourage site and patient participation. It is apparent that the measurement of risk in non-CTIMP trials needs to include the risk to the participant per se, but also the complexity of trial conduct (which impacts on participant risk if processes for implementing the trial are not thoroughly planned). We will discuss the risk to the participant and the complexity of trial conduct identified in 3 complex intervention trials co-ordinated by the CTRU, and present the impact this had on the set-up and implementation of each trial. We will present a risk-based approach for review and implementation of complex intervention trials, based on the type of intervention, participant, patient pathways and outcome measures to be used. Response rates of patient reported outcome measures administered postally influence robustness of trial results. We aim to present ways in which postal response rates can be maximised in pragmatic trials using experience gained in the implementation of postal follow-up process for two large multi- centre randomised controlled trials within stroke - Training Caregivers after Stroke (TRACS) and Longer Term Stroke Care (LoTS care) co-ordinated by the University of Leeds' Clinical Trials Research Unit. Both trials obtain their primary outcome measures via patient self-completed measures administered postally. Follow-up procedures include a mixture of postal and telephone reminders, typically undertaken at two weekly intervals. Response rates are carefully monitored and, where necessary, amendments to the process are made and accounted for in later trials. For example in TRACS, following initial monitoring of data to enhance completeness, the team instigated the collection of the primary endpoint via a telephone interview for patients who did not return questionnaires despite earlier standard postal and telephone reminders. This process was adopted much earlier in the subsequent LoTS care trial. In addition, after the publication of a systematic review on methods to increase response rates, trial pens were enclosed with questionnaire packs. Lessons from LoTS care and TRACS led to implementation of strategies to enhance compliance in subsequent trials (e.g. sending questionnaires to participants in advance of a face-to-face interview in participants' homes) Response rates during specific postal and telephone reminder stages will be reported as well as the characteristics (such as age, gender, level of anxiety and depression) of participants responding at the different stages. Many aspects need consideration when developing follow-up response strategies. Above all, strategies need to be easily adaptable, closely monitored from the outset and any lessons learnt disseminated. OBJECTIVE: Patient recruitment in trials often takes longer than expected. This is costly and if the sample size remains insufficient it might lead to indecisive conclusions for practice. The field of obstetrics is unique in the way that there are two patients: the mother and her baby. We aimed to identify reasons why women participated or declined participation in an RCT during or shortly after pregnancy. DESIGN: We performed a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews in women who were asked to participate in a RCT in obstetrics. We randomly selected both women who consented and those who did not for one of a set of 7 different RCT's. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed anonymously using a constant-comparative approach. Two researchers independently identified barriers and facilitators for participation. Interviews were continued until saturation was reached. RESULTS: Of 22 women approached, 20 (90%) consented to be interviewed. Respondents varied by educational level, ethnicity, geographical area, age and parity. The main motivation for trial participation was either to contribute to research, as the women were convinced of it's importance (50%) and/or preference for a treatment arm not available outside the trial (60%). Key barriers for participation in non-consenters were a negative association with the intervention (100%) and/or with randomization (45%). Fear and uncertainty, probably due to unfamiliarity with research and the feeling of being inappropriate because of unique personal characteristics, also played a role. Stress and doubt about the decision were present in both groups. CONCLUSION: Trial participation is a tough decision for most women. The final choice about participation is made intuitively, but will be influenced positively if women are well informed about the importance of research in general and the specific trial in particular. A personal, complete, well-timed dialogue may facilitate to make a balanced decision and improve trial participation. Good clinical practice (GCP) compliance is required for state of the art quality in clinical trials (CT). For HASTA trial (Hand suture vs stapling for closure of loop ileostomy) most participating centers are non-university institutions with little experience in CT. Therefore, we established a quality assurance system with on site monitoring visits and audits in all 27 centers. Based on monitoring reports, GCP violations are analyzed and their impact on patient safety and data quality is assessed. Preparation for HASTA included a 2-day investigator meeting with surgical training and individual on site initiation visits. During recruitment 48 regular on site monitoring visits were conducted. Close out visits and independent audits are currently carried out and will be finished in February 2012. Most GCP violations concerned patient informed consent (IC), although no IC was missing. 16 findings were rated major, 42 minor. Safety: 27 events were identified requiring serious adverse event reporting according to protocol. Primary endpoint needed to be corrected in 6 cases following monitoring findings. Violation of eligibility criteria were reported 4 times only. Further violations were regarding performance of trial intervention (wrong treatment group, procedure not performed according to protocol) and time window for follow-up visits. Quantitative and qualitative results of monitoring findings will be presented and compared to findings discovered by on site audits. As on site monitoring is not routinely established for investigator initiated surgical trials, relevance of monitoring and auditing for conduct of HASTA trial and validity of trial data will be discussed. Like most clinical research studies, minority enrollment rates are low in the EPR, particularly for African American males. In addition, African Americans have higher attrition rates compared with Caucasians. Therefore, in the EPR, we have employed special methods for recruiting and retaining minority subjects with varying levels of success. In this report, we will describe these methods, the lessons learned, and strategies used to improve minority recruitment and retention. These include: relationship-building with key stakeholders; capitalizing on personal and professional contacts; utilizing community "champions" and leaders; and targeting health-related and faith-based organizations/events. Success rates for the various strategies are presented by sex, age, race, and ethnicity. Objectives: During participation in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) adherence to the intervention and to other protocol requirements (e.g. visit attendance and completion of questionnaires) is essential for the production scientifically robust and clinically meaningful outcomes. Yet little is known about the issues that affect adherence during trial participation. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced adherence to research procedures by parents who were invited to enrol their infants in longitudinal RCTs aimed at allergic disease prevention. Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCT and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Parents appeared to commit to a contract in their participation in the studies. The potential to gain direct benefit from participation improved adherence to the protocol. However even when no personal benefit was obtained, parents put considerable effort into adhering. This reflected their beliefs in the worth of the RCT and the importance they placed on fulfilling the perceived contract. Staff took proactive and reactive approaches to improving adherence. This involved 'negotiating' adherence with colleagues and parents to balance manageable participation with achieving scientifically robust outcomes. Conclusion: Many factors are important in achieving optimal adherence to the intervention and other protocol requirements. Parental and staff willingness to invest considerable time and resources is essential to achieving optimal adherence. The results suggest that staff and parents considered that research participation represented a 'contract.' Maintaining an open dialogue regarding the nature of this contract helps to promote adherence in longitudinal RCTs. Objectives: Successful recruitment to clinical trials is essential for scientifically and clinically robust findings. Additionally problems with accrual results in increased trial costs and the inefficient use of resources. Yet little is known about effective recruitment to pediatric studies. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced recruitment to non-therapeutic, pediatric longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCTs and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analyzed thematically. Results: The potential value of participation had a substantial influence on recruitment. Parents considered possible benefits for their child and the scientific worth and integrity of the RCT before agreeing to participate. The possibility that participation would be mutually beneficial was relevant to parents and staff. The ability to manage the demands of participation was also important; parents delayed making a decision until they considered they could cope. The potential for participation to cause harm had a substantial influence; fathers were often more concerned about harm and placed less importance on the scientific worth of the study than mothers. Conclusion: Recruitment to non-therapeutic longitudinal RCTs in early childhood is influenced by complex inter-related factors. Holding detailed discussions with parents regarding the scientific value of the studies and the support that can be offered to improve the manageability of participation may help to promote recruitment. Mothers and fathers often appear to have different opinions about the potential for harm and benefit; holding discussions with both parents (where appropriate) may also increase recruitment.

The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) is a unique resource of subjects and their DNA samples that was created to facilitate genotype-driven translational research of complex disease. EPR goals are to recruit 20,000 individuals from North Carolina, collect their blood for DNA isolation, and make these DNA samples available to scientists to screen for genetic variants in environmental response genes. Once individuals with the "genotypes-of-interest" are identified, they are invited to participate in various types of follow-up studies ranging from basic laboratory ex vivo cell phenotyping investigations to observational studies and clinical trials. Since 2005, over 15,000 subjects of diverse sex, age, race, and ethnicity have been enrolled in the EPR from clinics at local hospitals, community-based events (health fairs, health conferences, community meetings, churches, etc.) and the internet. To minimize attrition and ensure high response rates for follow-up studies, these subjects are contacted annually (through multiple mailings and phone calls) and asked to update their contact information and other basic data. Nonresponders are traced using LexisNexis® and other public databases. Using these methods, our overall attrition rate is =5% and requires 236 patients (based on exact binomial probabilities). If >=230/236 patients (>=97.5%) are recurrence-free at 2 years then the trial will conclude that the event rate is =7 recurrences were observed the trial would be terminated, but more flexibility and guidance for interim monitoring was sought. In calculating the recurrence rate, total follow up for each patient is taken into account. As recurrences are more likely to occur in the early months following treatment, follow up is weighted according to recurrence rates observed in previous studies. To derive appropriate beta values for each analysis we simulated several design parameters. A repeated confidence interval approach was adopted. The beta spending function was selected so that: 1) overall alpha=0.05, beta=0.20 and 2) probability of stopping after 1 recurrence is very low. Results: The chosen rule was that at each recurrence the estimated rate and its exact confidence interval (CI) would be calculated. If the lower limit of this CI exceeded 2% then the trial would stop recruiting. Conclusions: A sequential interim monitoring plan has been developed. This methodology could be adopted in other studies to ensure that a rare event rate does not exceed a pre- specified threshold. Background: Reliable intermediate outcome measures are needed to assess clinical interventions in the current era of HIV treatment. We evaluated the performance of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index that uses routine clinical biomarkers to predict mortality as a surrogate outcome for randomized clinical trials. Methods: VACS Index scores were determined from data collected in the Options In Management with Antiretrovirals (OPTIMA) multi-national study of treatment strategies in patients with advanced HIV (Holodniy, 2011). OPTIMA data were used to validate the use of the VACS Index in a cohort of late-stage HIV patients. Proportional hazards regression and survival analysis using baseline VACS Index scores and changes in score during treatment were used to assess the utility of the index as an outcome for future clinical trials. Results: VACS Index scores at baseline correlated highly with mortality and with time to death in the advanced HIV patients enrolled in OPTIMA (Kirkwood, 2011; c = 0.749). Baseline score and change in score over 48 weeks of treatment were equally associated with all-cause mortality (c = 0.783). Conclusions: The VACS Index accurately predicted mortality and responded to changes in treatment. Measuring changes in VACS Index scores over relatively short time periods may offer an efficient alternative endpoint for the design of randomized clinical interventions among patients with HIV. : Holodniy M, Brown ST, Cameron DW, et al.

Session #423. Recruiting to target sample size is key to the success of all research yet continues to pose a significant problem. Potential barriers are often unknown at the time of securing funding and trials must have processes in place to identify and respond to these barriers. We present our experience from three UK publically funded multicentre RCTs of stroke patients and discuss ways in which recruitment strategies were adapted and refined to help achieve target recruitment. The main approaches we used focused on the site feasibility and the collection of screening data. Site feasibility and selection is used to understand the implementation and delivery of trials within existing services and provides recruitment estimates. This process revealed potential capacity and resource constraints which were subsequently used to facilitate discussion with service providers and allow appropriate allocation of funds. The recruitment estimates are used to engage in discussion with site during the recruitment phase to identify further barriers to target. Systematic collection of screening data from time of recruitment is reviewed monthly and is used to identify trends in the reasons for non-recruitment. This process led to changes in the recruitment and consent procedures to simplify the patient information and to allow obtaining consent on the same day as the provision of information. Eligibility criteria are reviewed and amended where clinically and scientifically valid. Amendments included increasing the time window of recruitment and allowing co-enrolment into other trials. Barriers to trials achieving target recruitment are multifaceted and trial teams need to be responsive to adapt trial processes accordingly. We have shown that the systematic identification of barriers from the time of site selection and during recruitment is essential and allows the trial to adapt to meet target sample size. Data on the impact of the changes on recruitment will be presented. Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC), a condition characterized by cervical discharge and inflammation, can be caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). For the 50- 80% of cases where the cause of MPC is unknown, it is unclear whether empiric antibiotic treatment is effective. Concerns that unnecessary antibiotic use may contribute to antibiotic resistance motivated a noninferiority clinical trial to compare the efficacy of empiric treatment with two antibiotics, azithromycin and cefixime, with placebo for MPC not attributed to STIs. The plan was to screen 3,357 women to enroll 772 participants with MPC, based on an estimated MPC prevalence of 23%. In one year, 577 women were screened at one family planning (FP) and 3 sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics, and 131 (23%) met the definition of clinical MPC: presence of cervical discharge and/or easily induced cervical bleeding on pelvic exam. Eighty-seven (66%) women enrolled on the trial, 31 (24%) were excluded due to the presence of an STI, 10 (8%) met another exclusion criterion, and 3 (2%) chose not to participate. The number of women screened per enrolled participant was 4.6 and 7.0 from FP and STD clinics, respectively. Some entry laboratory test results were not available until after enrollment. They identified 32 participants who were ineligible for the study: 24 had positive results for STIs and 8 did not have > 30 WBCs per high power field on the cervical gram stain, a measure of inflammation. Fifty-five women met all eligibility criteria. The study was terminated due to low accrual. Among women with MPC, 42% had one or more STIs, mainly among those enrolled at STD clinics. Future studies of MPC with unknown etiology should consider recruiting from FP clinics or factor in the high rate of exclusions due to STIs among women recruited through STD clinics. In Europe requirements for conducting clinical trials with medical devices were changed fundamentally by the council directive 2007/47/EC (2007). Meanwhile the international standard ISO 14155:2011 and the German Medical Device Act have been amended accordingly. All these regulations demand appropriately qualified investigational site teams. A certified training curriculum was established in order to develop the required operational competence. It was not only harmonized within the German Clinical Trials Center (CTC)-network, but also reconciled with ethics committees as they examine the qualification of investigators. The curriculum was designed as a two-stage process. It was based on an already well established 2-day training course for investigators focusing on ICH-GCP E6 and German regulations for clinical trials with medicinal products. This course was supplemented by an advanced half-day course for medical devices. This half-day course concentrates on the characteristic requirements of the federal authority and ethics committees, the newly set up electronic application procedure, and the electronic SAE- reporting obligation of sponsor and investigators. In the next step we established a standalone training course qualifying investigators for trials with medical devices without previous knowledge of conducting clinical trials. The curriculum covers all regulatory specifications, good clinical practice, uses incorporated didactic quizzes to upgrade learning effects, and considers the characteristics of Investigator Initiated Trials (IITs). With their know-how and academy CTCs are important components in the field of qualifying for conducting clinical trials with medical devices even beyond the scope of IITs. Our report will show the challenges of developing these certified training courses for investigational site teams. And it presents the experiences of the CCT Cologne conducting these courses and the evaluation by attending investigators. The Network of Hubs for Trials Methodology Research (HTMR Network) was established by the Medical Research Council to create a UK- wide regionally distributed research resource to improve the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials. Consisting of eight Hubs, the HTMR Network possesses methodological expertise and fosters links with clinical trials units and other methodological groups in universities, the National Health Service, industry and relevant professional bodies. The HTMR Network aims to (1) promote and fund high quality collaborative methodological research, both between Hubs and with other groups, UK-wide and internationally; (2) provide methodological advice to the clinical trials community; (3) encourage the implementation of the most effective and appropriate methodological practice, for example by providing education and training; and (4) work with stakeholders, in particular to agree on shared priorities for research and guidance and to advocate for improvements in the conduct of clinical trials. The HTMR Network has funded several successful projects involving the Hubs and other groups, including COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials), DIRUM (Database of Instruments for Resource Use Measurement) and workshops on topics such as randomised trials in surgery and on recruiting children to trials. We are working on methodological issues raised by stakeholders through consultation and provide the Methodology Advisory Service for Trials (MAST), a "second-line" advisory service for clinical trials units and Research Design Services in the UK. In February 2010, the Office of Clinical Research (OCR), at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), established an institutional clinical research monitoring program for MSKCC-sponsored studies. Although MSKCC has an extensive Data and Safety Monitoring plan which includes institutional and clinical department auditing, the focus on protocol compliance auditing only comprises a small percentage of the institutional portfolio in a given year (<15%). The new clinical research monitoring program focuses on in-house, investigator-initiated, MSKCC-sponsored studies, for which no outside organization provides monitoring or oversight. The goal of the monitoring program is to provide "real time" oversight of approximately 40% of MSKCC investigator initiated studies. In order to achieve this goal we developed the following: a set of criteria to evaluate protocols in our institutional portfolio for monitoring priority; documents to conduct protocol compliance, data verification, and regulatory documentation review; and guidelines for selection of participants to be monitored per visit. In addition, we identified department monitors and established written procedures for them to follow in the program. To determine the outcome of the monitoring visits, we created a rating system. Consistently high quality monitoring visits for a particular protocol would allow transition of that protocol off the monitored list and allow for us to initiate review of another protocol. Guidelines for serious and unresolved issues were also established which included suspension of new accruals for continuous unacceptable ratings. To keep a record of the monitoring visits, an access database to collect the summary letters of each visit and enter relevant data was created. In this poster presentation we will review our evaluation of the program and determine whether we are achieving our goal of "real time" oversight of 40% of our investigator initiated studies. We will also outline the challenges we encountered and methods we are developing to improve the program. Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (MiTy) is a multi-center, double masked, randomized placebo-controlled trial for pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. With 500 recruits expected from 25 participating centers across Canada, MiTy seeks to determine the effect of the addition of Metformin to a standard regimen of insulin on perinatal morbidity and mortality. Study sites are required to record specific outcomes for each study participant in prenatal visit forms every four weeks, based on gestational age at randomization. In order to accurately capture the complex nature of this large amount of data, it was decided that electronic data capture (EDC) would be more effective than paper data collection. Since EDC is a recent system, a strategy for disseminating user training was required. Collaborators participated in a three hour training session in which they were guided through a simulation that involved entering patient data into an EDC program. Due to differences in technical skills, abilities and learning styles, it was evident that the majority of the participants did not gain a comprehensive knowledge of how to use the EDC program. Following this, three separate strategies were implemented to provide more effective training. First, an EDC test website was created in which collaborators could enter simulated data to become proficient with the system. This allowed collaborators to familiarize themselves with the program according to their own skill level and pace. Next, a section in the Study Manual was created with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting for further clarification. Lastly, email and phone support was offered to remedy problems that could not be resolved by the Study Manual. These strategies proved both cost-effective and successful in providing collaborators with comprehensive EDC training. INTRODUCTION: Patient recruitment in clinical trials often takes longer than expected. Trials with slow recruitment are more costly and an insufficient sample size leads to indecisive conclusions. We identified factors influencing recruitment in clinical trials. DESIGN We sent a questionnaire to principle investigators of all 1130 trials prospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Register with an expected date of completing recruitment between 2005 and 2010. We used logistic regression analysis to assess whether characteristics of the trial or the principle investigator were associated with successful recruitment, i.e. 80% of the targeted number of patients was recruited within the planned time. RESULTS Of 392 trials questionnaires were completed. For these trials 232,707 persons were to be recruited. In half of the trials recruitment was unsuccessful. Although 42% of the trials were extended for ?6 months, when closing recruitment 46% still had recruited fewer patients than originally intended. Of the investigators 67% stated recruitment was more difficult than expected. Factors univariably associated with unsuccessful recruitment were: clear responsibilities for recruitment, investigator not PhD, multicenter trial, presentation at start for recruiters, newsletter for recruiters, pocket cards, email at start of the trial and a low expected number of randomizations per month. In multivariable analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, associated with recruitment were having a PhD (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0,17-0,83) and giving a presentation at start of the trial for recruiters (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.64) - the latter might be indicative for complexity of a trial. CONCLUSION Investigators frequently overestimate recruitment success when starting a trial. Although we identified factors associated with recruitment, we are unable to make general recommendations for improving recruitment. A possible limitation of this study is the risk for selective responses and unmeasured confounders. Investigators should be aware of potential recruitment difficulties when starting a new trial. The role of glucocorticoid receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in receptor function and metabolic disease is being studied at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). This in vivo and in vitro observational gene association study investigates functional relevance of SNPs in the NR3C1 gene. Individuals with and without functionally relevant SNPs are identified and recruited from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR). The EPR is a DNA biorepository of over 15,000 participants developed at NIEHS to help researchers better understand relationships between environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility and disease. The primary objective is to investigate in vivo the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9b A3669G, hGR N363S) in steroid responsiveness using dexamethasone and comparing serum cortisol levels by genotype. Initial comparisons indicate some hGR9b A3669G carriers are resistant to dexamethasone. The secondary objective is to investigate the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9b A3669G, hGR N363S) in human steroid responsiveness by comparing gene expression profiles of macrophages exposed ex vivo to corticosteroids. A pilot microarray study on macrophages without hGR SNPs revealed that although there is great variability in gene regulation between individuals, treatment with dexamethasone significantly altered gene regulation. These initial study results suggest functional relevance of hGR SNPs in the NR3C1 gene. The study is also the first EPR study conducted at the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and will help define and enhance operations of future EPR studies, including recruitment strategies. Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (MiTy) is a multi-centre, double-masked, randomized placebo-controlled trial for pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. With 500 recruits expected from 25 participating centres across Canada, MiTy seeks to determine whether the addition of Metformin to their usual insulin regimen, will decrease the incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Study sites are required to schedule prenatal visits for study participants every four weeks, based on gestational age at randomization. At MiTy prenatal visits, collaborators are required to supply study drug, distribute glucose strips, take specific blood tests, measure serum creatinine, download glucometer readings, and count pills to verify patient compliance, in addition to routine standard care. Prenatal visit information is then entered on the prenatal visit form following each patient appointment. Specific strategies were needed to help collaborators keep track of prenatal visit schedules; identify which tasks were required to be completed at each visit; and to indicate when to complete the prenatal forms. Therefore, several tools were developed to ensure successful adherence to the study requirements. A study manual was created to explain the specifics on how to manage the trial. This included a timeline with descriptions of tasks to be completed at particular stages during the patient's pregnancy, as well as checklists of tasks to be completed at each appointment. Prenatal visit appointment schedules were programmed upon randomization, notifying study coordinators of the exact week to schedule prenatal visits according to gestational age. Appointment reminders were emailed one week prior to the appointment, along with consistent email and telephone communication. Furthermore, centres receive tips and reminders through the monthly MiTy newsletter, group teleconferences, and regional meetings. This presentation will share successful approaches used to ensure adherence to study requirements. Assessment of the change in tumor size in response to treatment is critical in the evaluation of anti-cancer agents. The purpose of this presentation is to review the status of standardized solid tumor response criteria published since the early 1980s including WHO criteria, RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0. The existing criteria (WHO, RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1) will be compared in terms of number of target lesion requirement at baseline, lymph node usage in the calculation of tumor size, the requirement of confirmatory responses as well as other specific criteria used in the existing guidelines. Similarities and differences between the tumor assessment criteria will be illustrated using specific examples. Consideration of unidimensional and bidimensional measurements as well as the possibility of three-dimensional analyses will be discussed. New imaging techniques such as FDG-PET and MRI in tumor assessment as well as treatment classification, specifically cytostatic, will be examined. Non-measurable disease at baseline will also be considered with respect to each criterion. Other discussions will include "modified RECIST" and why it should be avoided. The limitations of standardization and possible future development will also be discussed. Background: Historically, there have been significant barriers to conducting research in tribal communities, including a lack of understanding of American Indian (AI) culture and research. Methods: Spring of 2002, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center (OUHSC) and four AI Tribe/Nations with Institutional Review Boards (IRB) (Absentee Shawnee Tribe, Cherokee Nation, the Chickasaw Nation, Choctaw Nation) and OKC Area Indian Health Service (IHS) IRB (collectively AI Partner(s)) proposed to participate in one of the largest pediatric diabetes research trials supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This venture required an agreement between AI Nations and academic university addressing essential elements: trust, collaboration, and successful outcome. Results: The four AI Tribe/Nations executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The MOA stipulated: 1) AI Coordinator hired to foster relationships, assist with recruitment, and facilitate pre- review by AI Partners of publications containing AI descriptive data. Sixty-one (61) AI patients were screened and forty (40) of those patients randomized into the TODAY Study. 2) Establish a committee comprised of AI Partner representatives to review publications. The committee meets for monthly publication updates with regular communication between meetings. The committee has met approximately 20 times and has reviewed approximately 50 items. Presentation will describe the efforts in retaining tribal partnerships including barriers that arose and resolutions. Conclusions: After 9 years, 4 AI IRBs and OKC IHS IRB have created and maintained a successful collaboration with an academic university in a large clinical trial. This multi-tribal research partnership is an excellent model of how community and multi-ethnic collaborative research can be effective. Purpose: To ascertain the experiences and perceptions of participation in cancer clinical trials by Hispanic and Black cancer survivors. Methods: As part of a larger study to develop a decision aid for participation in cancer clinical trials, we conducted semi-structured interviews with English-speaking Hispanic (15), Spanish- speaking Hispanic (15), and Black (15) cancer survivors. We employed quantitative content analysis to code responses to 16 specific questions based on transcripts from the interviews. Results: The average age of participants was 56.0 (SD 10.6) years; 93.3% were female, with most having had breast cancer (66.7%). Years since diagnosis ranged from 1-16, with an average of 3.3 (SD 3.0). Only 4 had been asked to participate in a clinical trial, and of these, 3 had joined a trial. Although only 4 had talked with a provider about participating, 23 (54.8%) wished that such a conversation had happened. In addition, 32 (71.1%) said that they would be willing to participate in a trial, and another 8 (17.8%) said that they may be willing. Almost all, 97.8%, said that it would be helpful to hear other cancer patients' experiences with clinical trials. However, most (81.8%) stated that it would not make any difference if the people relaying the experiences were of the participant's own race/ethnicity. Rather, information from someone with their own type of cancer was viewed as very important by 36%. Conclusions: Although few participants had even talked about clinical trials with their health care providers, most cancer survivors expressed willingness to participate. These findings highlight the need for discussions about clinical trials between physicians and patients. Increasing cancer patients' knowledge and self-efficacy to discuss clinical trials with healthcare providers, for example through a decision aid, may lead to a much needed increase in participation rates. Purpose: Participation in cancer clinical trials is very low, particularly for minority cancer patients. The goal of this research was to develop a web-based decision aid to improve minority cancer patients' decision making about whether to participate in a clinical trial. Methods: Steps in developing the decision aid were: a) collecting information on barriers and promoters of participation; b) developing a theoretical framework to conceptualize the decision aid components; c) using cognitive interviewing to pilot test the decision aid; and d) testing the decision aid to determine its effects on attitudes and knowledge about cancer clinical trials. Information was collected using 3 complementary approaches: a) data from a telephone survey of 1100 cancer survivors; b) a literature review; and most importantly, c) semi-structured interviews with cancer survivors. All participants were either Hispanic or Black. Results: For the semi-structured interviews, 45 participants were recruited. The information from the 3 sources was used to develop the KEV (Knowledge, Empowerment, and Values) framework for the decision aid. The website was developed, and successfully pilot tested with 8 participants. Currently, we are assessing the effectiveness of the decision aid to improve patients' knowledge about clinical trials, empower them to talk with their health care provider about trials, and clarify their values and preferences related to trials participation in 100 participants. Assessment of the effect of the decision aid is done by comparing knowledge, attitudes, and decisional conflict about clinical trials before and after viewing the decision aid. Conclusions: While quantitative data on the effectiveness and acceptability of the decision aid is not yet available, feedback from the participants has been extremely positive. Participants knowledge increases, and many state that they wish they had had such an instrument when they were first diagnosed. Our ultimate goal is to make this decision aid widely available. The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) was established to improve the health of women and their children through clinical research and education. As the data coordinating centre for several international randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is imperative that all trial operations are completed in a consistent manner to ensure maintenance of a quality management system. Thus, in adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, CMICR uses written standard operating procedures (SOPs) in its daily operations. In a team setting, it is especially important to have a standard set of detailed SOPs, along with clear, well-established rules to follow. This allows for the management of various aspects of the organization to be structured and easily maintained. In previous years, each trial team created and maintained their individual SOPs. This resulted in varying procedures between each study and a lack of detail, which was addressed in the new format. Various methods were employed to identify the most effective way to achieve uniformity of all SOPs. A staff member was designated the specific role of standardizing all trial SOPs to ensure consistency. The existing SOP system was reviewed over a three month period to assist in developing an improved structure. This new structure includes a revised coding system, as well as improved methods for archiving and updating task-specific SOPs. A template was also created to ensure a simple, easy-to-read layout of all newly established SOPs. In addition, to assist in the implementation of the new SOP system, specific guidelines were established on how to create an SOP document. All SOPs are submitted to the designated staff member for review, and are made accessible to all staff. These revisions to the SOP system have addressed inconsistencies, and created cohesion throughout the organization. The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto, Ontario, Canada The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) is the data coordinating centre and administrative site for several large, multi-centre, international randomized controlled trials that aim to improve clinical practice and the health outcomes of women and their children. CMICR has established an international collaborative group of research sites that may simultaneously participate in several CMICR-coordinated trials. It has become evident that successful recruitment and protocol adherence of a site in one CMICR-coordinated trial does not guarantee its success in another, and in trials with limited budgets and timelines, identifying suitable sites is vital. To assist in the site evaluation and selection process, CMICR developed an improved trial-specific Site Feasibility Questionnaire (SFQ). The revised SFQ developed by CMICR includes four main sections. The first, "Study Background", includes the research summary, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and outlines the study requirements. In the second section, "Site Information", sites are asked to provide information about their experience and performance in other research trials, resource information (i.e. research staff, facilities, equipment), and the total number of patients that meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria annually. The third section, "Study Protocol Requirements", is important in determining whether the site will be able to adhere to the study protocol. Sites are asked about their local standard of care and whether they will be able to follow the schedule of events and carry out all the required tasks. The final section covers recruitment topics and sites are asked to explain any anticipated difficulties with the trial. Once the centre has reviewed the protocol and considered all survey responses, the final requirement is to provide their expected annual recruitment goal. The presentation will share how to write an effective Site Feasibility Questionnaire that will help in site evaluation and selection process. Ensuring timely recruitment of appropriate subjects into clinical trials is not only a measure of study discipline, it provides economic efficiencies and also ensures that study results will be relevant since they are reflective of current practice. We have developed processes to ensure the timely recruitment of appropriate subjects and will provide suggestions and examples from several large international trials involving over 500 hospitals in more than 40 countries. Not only is timely recruitment essential to success of the trial, adherence to the trial intervention and complete follow-up on all patients is critical. We have developed tools to encourage compliance and prevent "potential lost to follow-up" . We will also present examples of specific impediments to follow-up. Among these examples is recent privacy legislation enacted in some countries which has fostered an environment of uncertainty and caution at many investigating sites. There is a perception that individual rights can take precedence over the completeness and accuracy of the clinical trial results. Site personnel have refused to follow any patient who has "withdrawn his/her consent". We will demonstrate how we have been able to overcome this obstacle in most countries by clearing up misconceptions and by re- educating the investigating site personnel. Successful blood sample collection in multi-center trials could be achieved through the implementation of a trial-specific Quality Assurance Monitoring System (QAMS) that ensures the high-quality sample retrieval needed for optimal biomarker measurement. In the SOX Trial, a Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Heart & Stroke Foundation funded multi-center RCT of active vs. placebo stockings to prevent PTS in 803 patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood specimen samples were collected within the first 6-mths of diagnosis to evaluate whether biomarkers reflective of inflammation, coagulation activation and genetic thrombophilia influence PTS development. At baseline, 1 and 6-mth visits, blood samples drawn from consenting patients were processed, aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes, frozen at -80°C and batched from 24 study sites to the Trial Coordinating Centre (TCC) for central storage according to study Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) instructions. Specimens were then assessed for quality based on these standards: sample recovery (SR), correct sample type (CST), adequate sample volume (ASV) and correct tube labeling (CTL). For buffy-coat collection, all 4 criteria were met for 79% of samples: 99.2%, 79.9%, 99.8% and 100% for SR, CST, ASV and CTL standards, respectively. For platelet-poor plasma collection, all 4 criteria were met for 94.3% of samples: 97.7%, 98.2%, 99% and 100% for SR, CST, ASV and CTL, respectively. In general, we noted that sites with lower overall quality were those with a lower patient retention rate, frequent coordinator turnovers, and sample processing left to study personnel. Development of site-directed SOPs followed by routine TCC quality checks for sample integrity are two economical ways to implement a successful QAMS in budget-limited government-funded studies; these mechanisms help safeguard sample quality, reduce missing data and enhance credibility of study results. Additional site-specific monitoring may also be warranted for study sites with poor performance and limited resources. There are unique challenges faced in the conduct of clinical trials in the relatively new research field of cardiac surgery. Several strategies have been implemented in the start-up phase of a large, international, publically-funded clinical trial in cardiac surgery (the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery (SIRS) trial) to address these challenges. Currently, the largest published clinical trial in cardiac surgery is the ROOBY trial which recruited 2203 patients from 18 centers. SIRS will recruit 7500 patients from approximately 85 centers in 18 countries, making it the largest clinical trial conducted in cardiac surgery to date (recruitment as of Nov. 30, 2011 was 1919). From the experience of starting-up SIRS, many challenges were identified and strategies have been used which can be translated to other research fields, particularly to trials being conducted in new disease research areas. The most common challenges faced during the start-up phase of a large, international clinical trial are: adhering to project timelines; dealing with various country-specific regulatory issues; identifying appropriate clinical sites; and ensuring proper study conduct for the duration of the trial. In SIRS, there were the added unique challenges of being a study in a fairly new clinical research field with many novice investigators and without an established global cardiac surgery research network, as well as having limited funding. These challenges and the implemented strategies used to address these obstacles have been outlined in Table 1. Conducting global clinical research is complex and involves many hurdles, especially in a relatively new area such as cardiac surgery. SIRS will hopefully pave the way for future large clinical trials in cardiac surgery by building a global network of investigators, and by developing tools to meet the challenges (particularly in the start-up phase) which are crucial to the successful and efficient coordination of a large clinical trial. Under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA), the protocol "Use of Lorazepam for the Treatment of Pediatric Status Epilepticus: A Randomized, Double- Blinded Trial of Lorazepam and Diazepam," changed from one Clinical Research Organization (CRO) to another CRO mid- study. The transition included moving from paper to electronic case report forms (CRFs). The transition involved four steps: 1) transferring the datasets from the previous CRO's data format to the new data format, 2) creating a user-friendly electronic data capture system that included all required fields and any new fields desired by the sponsor, 3) accurately mapping and uploading the data from the previous CRO to the new system and 4) transitioning the sites to the new system. To streamline these processes, collaboration with the previous CRO, the study sponsor, and the coordinators performing the data entry was essential. Building the electronic data system required identifying all required fields, determining the format of data fields, changing free text fields to drop-down fields, adding new fields requested by the sponsor, obtaining any data quality checks implemented by the previous CRO, and assuring sponsor approval for all changes made to the data collection procedures. All uploaded data required extensive quality control to assure the accuracy of the mapped data. Site transition involved creating a plan for the collection of ongoing data while the electronic system was in process, including reporting of serious adverse events and protocol deviations, and training the sites on the new system. Soliciting input from the site coordinators on the data collection process was valuable in improving efficiency of and satisfaction with the new data collection system. Background: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) invests heavily in the conduct of clinical trials benefiting public health. For the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), trial quality is managed in part through a risk-based monitoring program performed by contract monitors. Prior to 2010, these monitoring functions were not subject to independent review. In 2010, DAIDS began sponsoring an independent auditing program to assess the quality and effectiveness of the contract monitoring. We report on the development and progress of these quality assurance (QA) audits during the first 2 years of the auditing contract, where ~90 QA audits were conducted, and on their preliminary impact on the DAIDS monitoring program. Methods: Using an independent contractor for the NIAID Auditing Services Program (NASP), QA auditors sampled monitoring reports and performed on-site audits at selected clinical research sites (CRSs). About 12 CRSs were chosen quarterly based on several qualifying criteria, including monitoring report content and risk level of protocols. Routine NASP audits are characterized primarily as performance audits rather than Good Clinical Practice (GCP) audits, since DAIDS procedures for the monitoring contractor are very focused due to the risk-based monitoring program design. Teams of NASP auditors based in the United States, South Africa, and Brazil were trained on DAIDS-specific procedures and the same instructions provided to monitors. Auditors reviewed a sample of the same materials that were previously monitored, and reported directly to the DAIDS sponsor on any findings. Results: From over 740 CRSs in nearly 50 countries, over 1170 on-site monitoring visits were performed at about 233 CRSs in 21 countries over the past 2 years. Sampling those visits, ~90 NASP audits were completed in 14 countries, with no critical and few major findings observed. Several findings led directly to significant improvements in DAIDS monitoring policies and procedures. Over the past decade, the administrative burden of clinical trials has become an issue of national concern. One significant component of the bureaucracy is ensuring compliant billing practices. Where a coverage analysis at a single site may take as many as eight hours to complete, the inefficiency of this being repeated by every site in a multi-institution clinical trial highlights an unnecessary burden. One cooperative group, SWOG, piloted providing a coverage analysis to its sites and found the utility of doing so most benefited lower-accruing sites, who reported the most time spent completing analyses for trials they participated in and with the least resources to do so. The pilot also revealed that some sites had not yet adopted a practice of completing a coverage analyses, pointing to the increased risk of clinical billing fraud. With the future of cancer research diverging from standard of care and into innovative new directions such as biomarker discovery, the current federal funding system for cancer research requires processes to ensure compliant billing. In multi-institutional clinical trials, having the sponsor providing a coverage analysis using national guidelines and standards adds efficiency to an administratively over- burdened clinical trial management process. Further, the provision of a sponsor-provided coverage analysis particularly benefits the lower-accruing sites in reducing the risk of fraudulent billing. Cancer research sponsors can easily support success and continued participation by community practices by providing coverage analyses. Project supported by NIH funded grants CA032102 and CA037429 Many dose finding designs including the continual reassessment method (CRM) have been shown as statistically advantageous over traditional up down methods such as the '3+3'. However, these designs have been slow to gain popularity as they can be computationally intensive, often need specialized software, and require additional input during protocol development. We present a practical application that utilizes the likelihood-based CRM to monitor an ongoing investigator initiated '3+3' phase I trial for lymphoma patients at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center. During this trial, dose-limiting toxicities were redefined and there were concerns about the flexibility of the '3+3' to accommodate these changes mid-cohort. Since the CRM accommodates various cohort sizes and makes use of all accrued patient toxicity information to estimate the dose closest to the maximum tolerated dose at any point in the trial, we monitored the ongoing trial to confirm dose escalation rules according to the '3+3' were appropriate. Additionally, we compared operating characteristics of various CRM designs that accommodate ordinal or binary toxicity grades. We describe what information was needed to construct the initial design as well as how current accrued toxicity data was included in the model to estimate the next dose needed, using the R package ordcrm. Interestingly, this monitoring exercise gave clinical investigators, biostatisticians, and other research team members the opportunity to learn more about the likelihood-based CRM and gain information regarding the logistical issues and advantages of applying this design in practice. Not only did this verify that the CRM is feasible to implement and incorporates more toxicity information throughout the trial, but it has educated clinical research team members on this alternative dose finding design and has sparked interest in using the likelihood-based CRM as the design in future trials. The utilization of randomization in phase II trials is increasingly being recommended in the evaluation of anticancer therapies prior to pursuing larger phase III trials. Randomized comparisons offer protection against selection bias and are needed when historical control data are not available for designing a new trial. Several candidate randomized designs can be considered depending on trial design and objectives. A phase II randomized trial in breast cancer of two candidate targeted therapies is planned in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The study endpoints are tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). We consider different study designs to determine patient number requirements and assess feasibility and performance of the trial design under different scenarios. Specifically, we utilize i) selection design (design A); ii) two-stage selection design (design B); iii) screening design (design C); and iv) two-stage randomized phase II trial design (design D). Given the null and alternative hypotheses assumptions for response and PFS endpoints of this particular breast cancer trial, patient number requirements are reasonable across all potential trial designs. Designs C and D offer more conclusive results given the hypothesis-testing strategy of these designs. For the particular regimens and clinical problem being addressed in this phase II breast cancer trial, we favor the use of designs C or D which, although requiring slightly bigger patient numbers, affords more definitive conclusions on whether to proceed to a larger phase III trial. It is important to carefully assess a particular clinical trial scenario to decide not only whether to proceed with a single arm, historical control design but also the most appropriate randomized design if the latter is of interest. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has successfully completed phase Ia and Ib clinical trials of one of their leading HIV vaccine candidates in 2010. While China is committed to launch its first HIV vaccine efficacy trial, it is important to appropriately choose the most promising vaccine regimen to advance from Phase IIa safety and immunogenicity testing to later phase efficacy testing. The candidate vaccine regimen is comprised of 3 DNA prime immunizations followed by one replicating Tiantan Vaccinia (rTV) virus vector boost. Since the timing of the vector boost will have great impact on the potency and longevity of the vaccine-induced immune responses, the Phase IIa trial is designed to evaluate 3 different boosting schedules and to select the best to advance to efficacy testing. For Phase IIa testing, since multiple immunogenicity and safety endpoints with an ordering of preference are of interest for assessment with respect to clinical and biological relevance and importance, we propose a ranking and selection design that accounts for multiple endpoints of different types and allows for equal ranking when vaccine arms are indistinguishable within certain pre-specified margin from the best arm. Bootstrap-based evaluation of the precision of ranking is performed for each endpoint. In addition, to prevent advancing any vaccine arms from trials with uniformly week candidates, we require that a vaccine regimen to be selected must exceed an absolute minimum response probability and/or magnitude threshold. Sample size calculations are performed to evaluate how many vaccinees per arm are needed to achieve high probability of correctly selecting the arm with the best combination of 4 endpoints. Preliminary simulation results show that such selection design performs well. As the distinction between the best arm(s) and inferior arm(s) becomes larger, the selection accuracy increases. Overall the probabilities of incorrect selection are low. Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention plans to launch the country's first Phase IIb HIV vaccine efficacy trial in 2014. The candidate vaccine regimen is comprised of 3 DNA prime immunizations followed by one replicating Tiantan Vaccinia (rTV) virus vector boost. Supported by a supplementary fund to the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) by NIAID, the HVTN statistical team is currently working closely with Chinese researchers on the design and planning of this trial. The proposed trial design is considered to be reviewed by the Chinese State FDA in early 2012. We intend to apply a contingency two-stage evaluation of vaccine efficacy (VE), where durability of VE over a range of 0-3 years will be evaluated in Stage 2 if and only if positive VE proximal (e.g. over the first 18-24 months) to the immunization series is detected in Stage 1. Such a strategy is under consideration for the design of future HVTN trials in South Africa which may launch after the start of this China trial. To foster the most synergetic collaboration, we expect to work with a collaborative trial design team including representatives from trial sponsors, regulators, vaccine developers, manufactures, the Institutional Review Board of China CDC and key HIV vaccine researchers from both US and China. We acknowledge that the design phase will be highly iterative in order to finalize various context-driven trial design parameters, including study population, trial endpoint, type I and type II error rate level, trial outcome monitoring type and monitoring plan. Because the primary HIV vaccine trial sponsors are, for the first time, outside of US and the design expertise is primarily from the US, experience gained and lessons learned during such a process will be a treasure to share with the international clinical trial community. While many Phase III clinical trials have efficacy and safety endpoints, sample size calculations are generally based on efficacy, with safety addressed separately as a secondary endpoint. However, the overall clinical effect often involves efficacy and adverse safety or side effect trade-offs. While joint efficacy and safety endpoints have often been used for Phase II dose finding studies, such approaches have found limited application in Phase III trials. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading morbidity in extremely preterm infants, and prolonged mechanical ventilation increases BPD risk. Dexamethasone can facilitate extubation and decrease BPD incidence, but risk of neurodevelopment impairment (NDI) has led to decreased use. Because preliminary evidence suggests a better long-term safety profile for hydrocortisone than for dexamethasone, we designed a Phase III trial to sequentially evaluate the composite hypothesis that hydrocortisone (a) reduces the risk of death or BDP at 36 weeks; and (b) has an acceptable safety profile for death or NDI at 18 to 22 months. For the two- stage evaluation using robust Poisson models, we will first estimate relative risk and test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone lowers risk of death or BPD. If this test shows benefit, we will evaluate safety descriptively with safety considered achieved if either (1) the point estimate of risk of death/NDI is lower for hydrocortisone, or (2) death/NDI risk for hydrocortisone is increased, but the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the ratio of death/BPD benefit to death/NDI risk is greater than 4. We describe procedures used for power and sample size calculations for this two- stage testing approach, present results from those calculations, and compare operating characteristics of this approach to one previously reported that involves joint testing of the bivariate death/BPD and death/NDI outcomes using extensions of methods described by Tournoux, et al (Contemporary Clinical Trials; 28:514). The objective was to undertake a phase II trial (TO-PARP) to identify the best CRPC patient group(s) to be studied for sensitivity to olaparib in a phase III trial. A multistage phase II design has been adopted which has a non-randomised component with response as the primary endpoint followed by a randomised component with overall survival as the primary endpoint. Non-randomised component : This allows early progression to a randomised comparison if there is evidence of a high response rate (50% or more) in unselected patients. Biomarker defined groups are investigated for treatment sensitivity if the response rate is weaker than this. The first stage involves entry of 30 patients. If 50% or more respond then no more patients will be entered and the randomised component will be undertaken in unselected patients. If 2 (7%) or less respond then olaparib will be rejected. If between 3-14 (10%-47%) patients respond then a further 15 patients will be entered. Should 23 (51%) or more respond overall then the randomised component will be undertaken in unselected patients but if 5 (11%) or fewer respond then olaparib will be rejected. Otherwise with 6-22 responders (13%-49%), biomarker analysis of tissue collected from all 45 patients will be undertaken with the aim of identifying a sensitive subgroup, with a response rate which is compatible with a 50% response rate. If such a subgroup is found, a confirmatory single stage 44 patient trial will be undertaken in this group; this will also yield experience of prospective biomarker testing in a multi-centre clinical trial setting. Randomised component : a phase II assessment of the results generated in the non-randomised part, offering more secure evidence before proceeding to phase III. 180 patients will be randomised 2:1 to olaparib or an appropriate standard of care (? 1-sided 10%, power 80%). Food can have very different effects in terms of health, because of nutrient composition and dosage. In nutritional field, multiple outcomes or multiple hypotheses related to the inter-relationships among those outcomes are common. This induces several statistical issues related to the inflation of the statistical error. Such aspects are not commonly taken into account in nutritional research, whereas are very commonly accomplished for in the drug-related investigations. In the context of multi-functional food, there can be both multiple effects on the health target of a given nutrient, or multiple nutrients acting toward a single target or perhaps even on multiple targets. In nutritional fields it unrealistic to take hypothesis and outcomes as independent, mostly because nutrient effects are strongly related to each other. This induces a different correlation structure among outcomes and targets. Basically, if no health claims intended for components, then the composite endpoint is tested at a predefined alpha-level and components are not statistically tested: then adjustment for multiplicity is needed, and the basic choice would be on how to consider the concurrent outcomes. If claims are intended for components, then a sequential testing scheme might be applied: the composite endpoint is statistically significant ant the alpha-level, and then tests for components are made in sequence for the same significance level alpha. No claims can be made if sequence breaks. The usage of more complex models allows for instance to approach the problem as a fallback testing strategy: allow to continue testing even if sequence breaks, testing the hypothesis after the failed using a weighted Bonferroni method. This paper discuss the issues arising in multifunctional research by multiplicity in testing, both with regard to multiple nutrients and to multiple effects of a single or more nutrients on the people's health. BACKGROUND. In the past few decades, it has become increasingly common for scientists based in richer countries to initiate clinical trials to be conducted in higher risk groups, in developing countries. This may creates opportunities for exploitation, as some activists and authors have argued, following early closure of several trials aiming at testing antiretrovirals for HIV prevention (PrEP), in 2004-2005. We aimed to compare the scientific methods of trials involving recruitment in developing countries to trials involving recruitment only in industrialized countries. METHODS. We conducted a systematic review, with a focus on efficacy/effectiveness trials. Based on guidance documents for the ethical conduct of HIV biomedical prevention trials (by UNAIDS/ WHO and by the Institute of Science), we developed a list of 33 key items. We searched Medline, Embase, Central, trial registries and the World Wide Web to identify eligible trials; and we communicated with investigators to obtain protocols and reports. Each protocol was fully reviewed by two independent assessors. RESULTS. We identified nine eligible trials, among which four had closed early at least one study site. We obtained full- text protocols for all efficacy trials. All but one trial had a Jadad score of 3/5 or more. On average, 20/33 validity items were reported in PrEP efficacy trials (61%). This average was 19/33 (58%) for trials closed early versus 2/33 (67%) for other trials. DISCUSSION. Early closures in HIV PrEP efficacy trials might be related to methodological issues. It is unclear how methods might have affected the ethical design and/or conduct of those trials. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastases have long been believed to be osteoblastic because of bone remodeling leading to the formation of new bone. However, recent studies have shown increased osteolytic activity in the beginning stages of PCa bone metastases, suggesting that targeting both osteolytic and osteoblastic mediators would likely inhibit bone remodeling and PCa bone metastasis. In this study, we found that PCa cells could stimulate differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts through the up-regulation of RANKL, RUNX2 and osteopontin, promoting bone remodeling. Interestingly, we found that formulated isoflavone and 3,3′-diindolylmethane (BR-DIM) were able to inhibit the differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts through the inhibition of cell signal transduction in RANKL, osteoblastic, and PCa cell signaling. Moreover, we found that isoflavone and BR-DIM down-regulated the expression of miR-92a, which is known to be associated with RANKL signaling, EMT and cancer progression. By pathway and network analysis, we also observed the regulatory effects of isoflavone and BR-DIM on multiple signaling pathways such as AR/PSA, NKX3-1/Akt/p27, MITF, etc. Therefore, isoflavone and BR-DIM with their multi-targeted effects could be useful for the prevention of PCa progression, especially by attenuating bone metastasis mechanisms.},

abstract={A tide-influenced two-layer aquifer system in northern Germany was investigated using environmental dating tracers (^sup 3^H, ^sup 39^Ar, ^sup 14^C), the noble gas isotopes ^sup 3^He, ^sup 4^He and Ne. The study area is a marshland at the River Ems estuary, exposed to regular flooding until AD 1000. The construction of dykes, artificial land drainage and groundwater abstraction define the hydraulic gradient. The aquifer depicts a pronounced age stratification with depth. Tritium concentrations above 0.03 TU are found only in the top 30 m. Two tritium-free samples between 20 and 30 m depth show ^sup 39^Ar ages of 130 and 250 years. Below a clay layer-about 50 m below surface level (mbsl)-all analysed samples are ^sup 39^Ar free and, thus, older than 900 years. The initial ^sup 14^C activities were about 70 pmC. Resulting ^sup 14^C ages increase with depth and increase up to 9,000 years, in agreement with minimal ^sup 39^Ar ages. Concentrations of radiogenic ^sup 4^He correlate with ^sup 14^C ages. Samples in a mid-depth range (20-70 mbsl) show significant gas loss. The gas loss is assigned to recharge in a methane producing environment. Deduced ^sup 4^He ages were used to assign this water to a infiltration period of about AD 1000. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Over the last fifty years mobility practices have changed dramatically, improving the way travel takes place, the time it takes but also on matters like road safety and prevention. High mortality caused by high accident levels has reached untenable levels. But the research into road mortality stayed limited to comparative statistical exercises which go no further than defining accident types. In terms of sharing information and mapping accidents, little progress has been mad, aside from the normal publication of figures, either through simplistic tables or web pages. With considerable technological advances on geographical information technologies, research and development stayed rather static with only a few good examples on dynamic mapping. The use of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices as normal equipments on automobile industry resulted in a more dynamic mobility patterns but also with higher degrees of uncertainty on road traffic. This paper describes a road accident georeferencing project for the Lisbon District involving fatalities and serious injuries during 2007. In the initial phase, individual information summaries were compiled giving information on accidents and its majour characteristics, collected by the security forces: the Public Safety Police Force (Polícia de Segurança Pública - PSP) and the National Guard (Guarda Nacional Republicana - GNR). The Google Earth platform was used to georeference the information in order to inform the public and the authorities of the accident locations, the nature of the location, and the causes and consequences of the accidents. This paper also gives future insights about augmented reality technologies, considered crucial to advances to road safety and prevention studies. At the end, this exercise could be considered a success because of numerous consequences, as for stakeholders who decide what to do but also for the public awareness to the problem of road mortality PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In 2003, a systematic review and meta-analysis of its efficacy and safety in depressive disorders was sponsored by the UK Department of Health and performed by the UK ECT Review Group.1 A major finding of that review was that there was substantial evidence to support the short-term efficacy of ECT in depressive disorders, and that it was superior to antidepressant drug treatment. By contrast, other studies raised concerns about the cognitive side-effects of ECT.2,3 Empirical stimulus dose titration was proposed as a means of reducing such side-effects.4,5 In Hong Kong, the utilisation of ECT is low. One study reported the number of persons receiving ECT in Hong Kong in 1998 to be 0.34 per 10,000 of the population,6 which was much lower than the rate in western countries.7,8 Also, only in the recent few years has empirical titration been widely practised by Hong Kong psychiatrists. Because of limited ECT research on Chinese patients and the relative lack of local experience with empirical titration, western guidelines have been adopted for this purpose. In particular, recommendations in the ECT Handbook of the Royal College of Psychiatrists were most often referred to.5 However, western guidelines are based on studies carried out on Caucasians and it is uncertain whether they can be generalised to Chinese patients. With a view to assessing the validity of such an assumption, we describe our early experience of ECT practice after starting empirical titration in 2006 in an acute psychiatric unit in Hong Kong. Methods This was a retrospective review of case notes of patients who had received ECT in the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Hong Kong from June 2006 to April 2009. This regional hospital undertakes a full range of specialty services. Its psychiatric unit serves a population of 0.8 million and admits both voluntary and sectioned patients. Empirical stimulus dose titration was first introduced in June 2006 and carried out using a standard protocol. A total of 34 patients received ECT during the 3-year study period. All relevant patient medical and ECT records were retrieved. Data collected included: demographic and clinical characteristics, consent for treatment, ECT parameters, documented side-effects, and clinical response. The ECT treatments were administered with MECTA spECTrum 5000Q (MECTA Corporation, Tualatin OR], US). The device administered bidirectional, brief, square- wave pulses, using a constant-current stimulus (24-1152 millicoulombs mC]). The empirical titration method was chosen, unless the patient had a life-threatening psychiatric illness (e.g. high suicidal risk or refusal to eat) necessitating a rapid clinical response, in which case preselected dosing was used. Preselected dosing was also used for patients who had previously responded well to such dosing, or were taking a beta-blocker or were at increased cardiac risk for other reasons. We adopted the protocol recommended by MECTA Corporation for both empirical titration and preselected dosing.9 Empirical titration started with a stimulus of 48 mC. If this failed to produce a seizure of at least 15 seconds, re-stimulation was performed at the next level of 96 mC, followed by 192 mC; no more than 3 stimulations were undertaken per patient, per session. After the seizure threshold was determined, a stimulus of 50% above the seizure threshold was delivered at the next session. For preselected dosing, a stimulus of 144 mC was administered for females and 288 mC for males, in the belief it corresponded to 50% above the assumed seizure threshold. In patients taking anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines, the latter drugs might be withdrawn or reduced in dosage before starting ECT. Patients were given intravenous thiopentone for anaesthesia and intravenous suxamethonium as a muscle relaxant. All the patients were adequately ventilated with 100% oxygen before the administration of ECT stimulus. We compared the seizure threshold determined by empirical titration and the MECTA instruction manual recommendation for preselected dosage.9 All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Windows version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL], US). The associations between seizure threshold of bilateral ECT using the empirical titration method and demographic and clinical factors were examined by Pearson’s correlation. The t test between means was used to compare seizure thresholds in male and female subjects, and in patients in receipt of or not in receipt of specific concomitant psychotrophic medications. The difference in demographic variables, clinical variables, clinical outcomes, and side-effects in patients undergoing empirical titration and preselected ECT dosing were compared using t tests between means for continuous variables, and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. The alpha level was set at 0.05 or below and all tests were 2-tailed. All data are shown as mean (± standard deviation SD]). The study was approved by our hospital ethics committee. Results A total of 34 patients received ECT during the 3-year study period, which amounted to 0.6% of the total number of admissions to our unit. All the patients were Chinese, except one who was of mixed Chinese and British origin. Their mean (± SD) age was 62 ± 19 (range, 21-87) years, and 60% were aged 65 years or above; 30 (88%) were females. Twenty- two (65%) patients suffered from depression, 8 (24%) had bipolar affective disorder, 2 (6%) had schizophrenia, and 2 (6%) had schizoaffective disorder. Twenty (59%) of the patients suffered from concomitant physical illnesses. Fourteen (41%) of the patients had hypertension, which was the most common physical disorder. The number of sessions at each course of ECT was 6 ± 2 (range, 3-10); 6 (18%) were terminated early before the 6th session (5 because they enjoyed complete remission, and 1 case as there was no seizure activity). Twenty-seven (79%) received ECT because of treatment-resistant illness; 5 (15%) as an emergency or life-saving procedure (high suicidal risk or refusal to eat), and 2 (6%) as first-choice treatment owing to a previous good response to ECT. Four (12%) of the patients lacked the capacity to consent for treatment for whom a second opinion was sought. Twenty-three (68%) of the patients received bilateral ECT, and empirical titration was used in 17 (50%) of them. The thiopentone dosage in the first session was 1.8 ± 0.6 (range, 1.0-3.3) mg/kg, and the suxamethonium dosage in the first session was 0.5 ± 0.1 (range, 0.2-1.1) mg/kg. Thirteen patients received bilateral ECT treatment according to the empirical stimulus dose titration method, not having received ECT in the previous 12 months. The initial seizure threshold was 81 ± 30 (range, 48-144) mC, with a variation of 200%. Five (39%) patients had a seizure with the lowest stimulus level (48 mC), and 9 (69%) required re-stimulations to induce a seizure; 8 (62%) required 2 stimulations and 1 (8%) required 3 stimulations. Seven (54%) patients had an increase in seizure threshold in subsequent sessions. If the stimulus dose was preselected according to the MECTA instruction manual at 50% above the assumed seizure threshold, the stimulus dose was 177± 63 (range, 144-288) mC, which amounted to an average over-estimate of 67 ± 88% (range, –33 to 300%). Seizure threshold was found to correlate with age (r = 0.6, p = 0.03), but not body mass index (r = 0.2, p = 0.63), thiopentone dosage (r = –0.1, p = 0.74), or suxamethonium dosage (r= –0.3, p = 0.26), and was not associated with gender (t = 0.07, p = 0.94), concomitant use of antidepressants (t = 1.1, p = 0.30), anticonvulsants including benzodiazepine (t = 1.1, p = 0.30), antipsychotics (t = 0.07, p = 0.94), or lithium(t = 0.47, p = 0.65). Among the 34 patients, side-effects were documented in 24 (71%). Headache was the most common side-effect and occurred in 16 (47%) of the patients, and post-ictal confusion in 8 (24%). A summary of the documented side-effects is shown in the Table. No patient suffered a prolonged seizure, for which an intervention was undertaken. Improvement in mental state was reported in 32 (94%) of the patients. Patients were discharged within 57 ± 105 (range, 1-547) days after having ECT; 19 (56%) were discharged within 3 weeks post-ECT. Seventeen (50%) patients underwent ECT by empirical titration and 17 (50%) by the preselected dosage method. The age of patients having empirical titration was 52 ± 18 (range, 21-86) years, and the corresponding figures for those having preselected dosages were 72 ± 16 (range, 34-87) years; the difference between them being statistically significant (t = 3.4, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to other baseline characteristics, including: gender (χ2 = 1.1, p = 0.60), body mass index (t = 3.3, p = 0.74), presence of physical illness (χ2 = 4.3, p = 0.08), antidepressant use (χ2= 0.2, p = 1.00), anticonvulsant use (χ2 < 0.001, p = 1.00), antipsychotic use (χ2 = 0.1, p = 1.00), lithium use (χ2 =0.1, p = 1.00), and concomitant medications for physical illness (χ2 < 0.001, p = 1.00). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to total number of side-effects (χ2 < 0.001, p = 1.00), post-ictal confusion (χ2 = 2.6, p = 0.11) or headache (χ2 = 0.5, p = 0.49). Other side-effects were too infrequent for meaningful analysis. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to clinical improvement (χ2 < 0.001, p =1.00). On average, patients undergoing empirical titration were discharged earlier (44± 45 days) than those given preselected dosages (68 ± 140 days) after the completion of ECT, but this difference was not statistically significant (t = 0.7, p = 0.50). Twenty-three (68%) of the patients underwent bilateral ECT and 11 (32%) underwent unilateral ECT. There was no statistically significant difference between these 2 groups in terms of baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, except that more of those receiving unilateral ECT suffered from physical illness (91% vs. 44%, χ2 = 6.9, p = 0.01). No statistically significant difference was noted between the groups for the total number of side- effects (χ2 < 0.001, p = 1.00), post-ictal confusion (χ2 = 1.9, p = 0.23), headache (χ2 = 0.4, p = 0.72), documented clinical improvement (χ2 = 0.3, p = 1.00), or length of hospital stay after ECT (t = 0.6, p = 0.53). Discussion This is an initial report of our early experience in transition from preselected dosage to empirical dose titration. Admissions for ECT accounted for 0.6% of the total number of admissions to our unit, compared to 0.4 to 1.7% found in state hospitals in the US.10,11 Most of our patients who received ECT were female (88%), and 56% were geriatric (aged ≥ 65 years). Similar findings have been reported in western countries. A study in the US reported that 71% of the patients who received ECT were female and 34% were aged 65 years or older,12 and in Edinburgh 71% were female and 46% aged 65 years or over.13 Some have postulated that the higher proportion of women among those receiving ECT was due to the higher prevalence of depressive episodes in women.10 Unlike western reports, where ECT was seldom performed for patients with any diagnosis other than depression,7,11,12,14 35% of our patients suffered other psychiatric disorders. This was consistent with an earlier report of ECT indications in Hong Kong, in which 35% of the patients did not suffer from depression.15 In particular, 12% of our patients suffered from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, which presumably reflects on the attitudes of Hong Kong psychiatrists regarding the management of the latter disorders. The Cochrane systematic review16 also suggested that ECT, when combined with antipsychotic drug treatment, may be considered a treatment option for patients with schizophrenia, particularly when rapid global improvement and reduction of symptoms was desirable. Most of our patients received ECT because of failed drug treatment. We charted the initial seizure threshold for bilateral ECT carried out in our patients using empirical titration and found the mean was 81 mC, which was lower than that reported in studies carried out in the US (86-134 mC).17,18 In all patients, seizure occurred within 3 electrical stimulations in the first ECT session. The real mean seizure threshold was likely to have been lower than what we reported, because we followed the MECTA instruction manual and started with a stimulus of 48 mC.9 Since 39% of our Chinese patients had initial seizure thresholds of 48 mC or less, in contrast to only 4% with less than 50 mC reported in a UK study,19 a lower starting electrical stimulus may warrant consideration in our Chinese patients. The Royal College of Psychiatrists in UK recommended that empirical titration should not be used in the management of life-threatening illness, where the rate of clinical improvement is critical,5 and we followed this advice in our hospital. However, due to the lack of studies and established dosing schedules for Chinese patients, we routinely followed the MECTA instruction manual preselected dosage table.9 Our study suggests that by doing so, we over-stimulated our patients by 67 ± 88%, and in extreme cases, even up to 300%. Thus, to establish the average seizure threshold and a suitable preselected dosage schedule for Chinese patients, more research on a larger sample is necessary. We found that the initial seizure threshold increased with age, which was consistent with findings from western studies.17,18 No other factors were associated with the initial seizure threshold. This supported the use of empirical titration to determine the seizure threshold for non-urgent cases, because seizure threshold cannot be reliably predicted by patient demographic and clinical factors. Side-effects were commonly reported after ECT though most were mild; headache was the most common (affecting 47% of the patients), whilst the more severe side- effects reported included: dental injury, bradycardia, oxygen desaturation, and bronchospasm. The patient who developed bronchospasm had a history of asthma, whereas 2 others who developed bradycardia and oxygen desaturation had good past health. Thus, careful pre-ECT assessment, as well as monitoring during the procedure, are important. Post- ictal confusion occurred after 24% of the treatments, which may be a particular problem in elderly patients.20 Since ECT is commonly performed in the elderly, regular assessment of cognitive function after ECT is recommended. Finally, improvement in mental state was reported in most patients, many of whom were discharged shortly after the completion of ECT. Comparison of patients undergoing empirical titration versus preselected dosage did not show differences with respect to side-effects or clinical response. However, our results might have been limited by the small sample size, inaccuracy of retrospective data, and the lack of standardised instruments to assess clinical response and side-effects. Moreover, cognitive side-effects were not routinely measured using valid rating scales. Given the excessive electrical over-stimulation of patients being offered preselected dosage therapy, and the possibility of increased cognitive side-effects from electrical over-stimulation,21 we favour the use of empirical titration in non-urgent settings. This study was limited by its retrospective design and small sample size. Nonetheless, it described roughly the range of seizure thresholds in bilateral ECT in our early experience with empirical titration, and yielded important data when compared to preselected stimulus dosing based on MECTA Corporation advice.9 It also described the common side-effects experienced by our patients, adding important data to ECT practice in Chinese patients. Since our hospital was a regional hospital accepting patients from primary and secondary settings, the characteristics of our sample were similar to what might be expected in other psychiatric hospitals in Hong Kong and therefore may be generalisable to other similar local facilities.

On 18 December 2006 by implementing The Hague Programme the EU Council adopted a Framework Decision 2006/960/TVR regarding the simplification of the exchange of information and intelligence-related information among the law enforcement institutions of the European Union Member States. The aim of this Framework Decision was to establish the rules for the facilitation of information accessibility providing the Member States with a possibility to exchange information more efficiently for the purposes of the prevention and investigation of criminal acts. Even though the provisions of this Framework Decision were developed following the principle “need to know”, this Framework Decision is considered to be a global initiative which could give the grounds for the change in the point of view of the intelligence agencies to the information collected and, at the same time, to stimulate them to share information.},

Vienas iš daugybės interesų yra teisinis interesas. Teisinis interesas 0 tai objektyviai egzistuojantis, teisės saugomas ir teisėsaugos institucijų ginamas socialinis poreikis, kurį suformuoja socialinės sąlygos ir kuris patenkinamas teisinėmis priemonėmis. Teisiniai interesai skirstomi į materialiuosius teisinius interesus ir procesinius teisinius interesus.

Teisminė teisinio intereso, kuris neturi materialiojo teisinio aspekto, gynyba yra beprasmė. Procesinis teisinis interesas atspindi tai, kad asmuo ne tik praneša apie pažeidimą, bet ir reikalauja teismo, t. y. valstybės gynybos. Teisėjui, sprendžiančiam ieškinio priėmimo klausimą, svarbu nustatyti šių abiejų interesų egzistavimą.

One of the varieties of interests is legal standing. Legal standing – an objectively existing social need protected by the law and protected by law enforcement institutions, which develops through social conditions and is satisfied by legal means. Legal standing is divided into substantive legal standing and procedural legal standing. It is impossible to analyze legal standing only in the light of procedural law provisions, since legal standing includes a substantive legal element. Judicial defense of legal standing that fails to embody the substantive legal element is meaningless. Procedural legal standing reflects the fact that the person not only reports on the infringement, but also requires judicial review, i. e. state defense. It is important for the judge handling the issue of admissibility of a lawsuit to establish the existence of both elements of legal standing. By handling the issue of a lawsuit’s admissibility, it is important for the judge to determine whether the future decision will have an impact on the rights and obligations of the claimant at the stage of starting the civil proceedings. By stipulating that such a decision will have no impact on the rights and obligations, it may be concluded that the claimant has no substantive legal standing. Initiation of a case in the absence of substantive legal standing contradicts the objectives of civil procedure. The acceptance of a claim in absence of substantive legal standing at the stage of civil case initiation must be rejected. The determination of the absence of substantive legal standing would prevent abuse of the proceedings and decrease the workload of judges. An analysis of court cases clearly shows that admissibility of claims and civil case initiation is related only with the claimants’ procedural legal standing.},

abstract={Straipsnyje aptariami kai kurie jurisprudencijos mąstymo būdai, sukeliantys loginius paradoksus. Tai atvejai, kai konstitucijose ar kituose teisės aktuose tų pačių žmogaus vertybių apsauga įtvirtinama tarpiškai (per žmogaus teises) ir kartu tiesiogiai, kai teisė kaip socialinis santykis tapatinama su jos objektais (biologine, socialine, psichine realybe), kai kuriamos refleksyvios sąvokos, operuojama „absoliučiomis teisėmis“, pernelyg abstrakčiomis sąvokomis, sudvejinami teisės subjektai, teisingumo vykdymo sąvokoje tapatinami bendrasis ir individualusis teisinio reguliavimo lygmenys, ignoruojama teisė kaip santykinai savarankiškas socialinių santykių reguliatorius.Alternate abstract:The article discusses certain ways of jurisprudence thinking, which cause logical paradoxes. These are the cases when in Constitutions or in other legal acts, the protection of adequate values of human beings is established progressively (though human rights) and at the same time directly, when the right is equated to a social relation with its objects (biological, social, psychological reality), when reflex concepts are being created and „absolute rights” are being operated, concepts too abstract, when subjects of law are being geminated and common and individual legal regulation levels are being equated in the concept of law enforcement, and when law as relatively independent regulator of social relations is being ignored.The necessity to establish the protection of human values in Constitutions not directly, but through human rights protection (progressively) rises from the equality of all subjects of law and from law as the relation of reciprocal obligations, which is based on the unity of permissions and orders and which obliges every holder of human values to recognize the same values of another person and thus restrict own behavior in their respect. In the opposite case, protection of human values would become too independent from the behavior of the holder of these values and thus would transform into a source of uncontrollable aggression. This is demonstrated by the legal problems arising after the abolishment of death penalty and entrenchment of direct protection of human life.Legal paradoxes of another type arise from used concepts that are too abstract, and their content is not revealed (e.g. the equation of constitutional legality and constitutional justice), when the solution of a legal problem is based on non–legal arguments (replacement of law as relatively independent legal regulator with economic regulators), and when the subjects of law are geminated (the issue of unborn life as a subject of law).},

abstract={Administracinė jurisdikcija šiuolaikinės administracinės teisės doktrinoje suprantama kaip administracinių institucijų teisė bausti už tam tikrus teisės pažeidimus taikant administracines sankcijas. Nors šiandien administracinės institucijos naudojasi gana plačiomis jurisdikcinėmis galiomis, nuolat vyksta diskusijos dėl tų galių siaurinimo ar visiško ribojimo. Teisinėje literatūroje dažnai išsakoma mintis, jog jurisdikcinė funkcija demokratiniais principais tvarkomoje valstybėje būdinga tik teismui, todėl administracinių institucijų atliekama tokio pobūdžio veikla yra daugiau totalitarinio režimo palikimas, prieštaraujantis Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucijoje įtvirtintam valdžių padalijimo principui, taip pat Konstitucijos 109 straipsniui, kuriame skelbiama tik teismo teisė vykdyti teisingumą. Tyrinėjant administracijos galias taikyti sankcijas už įvairius teisės pažeidimus ir modeliuojant šios srities teisinio reguliavimo perspektyvas svarbu apžvelgti istorinį palikimą šiuo klausimu. Todėl žvelgiant į tarpukario Lietuvoje (1918–1940) gyvavusias idėjas ir teisinę praktiką straipsnyje mėginama atskleisti administracinės jurisdikcijos ir administracinių sankcijų sampratą ir vietą to meto teisės sistemoje bei administracinės jurisdikcijos subjektų įvairovę, o taip pat jų jurisdikcinės veiklos teisinius pagrindus.Alternate abstract:The article reviews the ideas and legal practice in Lithuania between the two wars (1918-1940) and attempts to disclose the concept of administrative sanctions and their place in the legal system of that time, as well as the basis of activity in the field of administrative jurisdiction. Although these issues were not sufficiently discussed in legal doctrine, vast legal practice demonstrates a significant role of administration in implementation of legal sanctions. It should be noted that already in 1922, the Lithuanian Constitution established the principle of separation of powers, which is the basis of organization of government and the system of law of democratic states. However, already in those days scientists assumed that there is no and there cannot be any strict separation of functions of power. In addition to the typical function of governance, the administration pursues jurisdictional activity that was called “administrational punishment” in the doctrine of that time.Thus already in that time, specific terminology was used to define jurisdictional activity of administration, emphasizing its idiosyncrasy and independence in the context of criminal law. On the other hand, this independence was conditional because administrative institutions had to comply with criminal legislation while implementing administrative sanctions. There was no legislative act that would unify the process of administrative sanctioning or would set the general basis of application. Thus acknowledging the relatedness of administrative sanctions and criminal penalties, regulations analogous to those of criminal proceedings were used with certain exceptions. Administrative sanctions were imposed for the infringement of the procedure of the stay of foreigners in Lithuania, passports, statistics, holding meetings and events, sanitary, pharmacy, engagement in economic, commercial or professional activity, education, tax, labour, public order and other areas of public life.In numerous sources of administrative law of interwar Lithuania the major role was given to a monetary fine. Furthermore, legislative acts also provided for administrative sanctions that restricted special rights (e.g. rights allowing engaging in certain activities etc.). The right of administrative punishment was provided for different authorities, from ministers to ordinary policemen; however, the biggest jurisdictional powers were vested in the county governor. We may claim that the growth of jurisdictional powers of administrative authorities in interwar Lithuania was based exceptionally on feasibility arguments. While solving the problems of criminal justice resulting from work overload of courts and aiming to ensure public order in the state and lawfulness in general, administrative sanctions were regarded to be efficient and appropriate measures to achieve these aims. Administrative punishment compensated for the things that were impossible to implement by jurisdictional activities of courts.},

For various reasons, not all of the offences become known to law enforcement authorities. The authorities may not qualify the offences properly. Therefore, there is the unknown, “invisible” side of the criminality, i.e. unregistered part of this phenomenon. The ratio of latent criminality to registered criminality is also uncertain at a particular point in time. Likewise, the fluctuation of this ratio time-wise or structure-wise is uncertain, therefore, it may be concluded that the instability of this ratio could have a negative impact to the error margin associated with the results of the analysis of criminological indicators. The above-mentioned ratio is compound and one of its elements is the dynamically shifting time-lag between the commitment of criminal offences and their official registration. The first part of the article is dedicated to the analysis of the impact of this ratio to the bias associated with the results of the analysis of criminological indicators as well as to describing the model, which helps to minimize these error margins. Unfortunately, the described method requires that rigorous initial conditions are satisfied, otherwise the obtained results can not be considered reliable, i.e. this method is not suitable when the structure of data varies due to internal or external reasons or when the amount of criminal activity to be analyzed is nil, or when the criminal offence is retried under a different article of the Criminal Code during the pre-trial investigation. Therefore, the mathematical model used to minimize the margin of error encountered due to distortion of statistical data caused by variable time-shift between the commitment of criminal act and their registration is to be improved. While a certain part of the above-mentioned issues may be solved by using statistical data in respect of criminal acts in respect of which the court has already convicted the suspect or by simply prolonging the time-period of the analysis, the remaining issues can be solved only by revising the described model. The article proposes several modifications, which allow to eliminate the disadvantages of the original method, because they require application of less stringent conditions,thus enabling application thereof in volatile conditions of social reality more flexibly. Using these variations of the model should assist in fine-tuning of the assessment of distribution or structure of criminality as well as other criminological indicators, allowing obtaining more reliable criminological results.gative},

abstract={In this study, we explore the therapeutic potential of lapatinib a selective inhibitor of both the EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinases for the treatment of endometrial cancer. The effect of lapatinib on tumour cell growth and receptor activation was studied in a panel of human endometrial cancer cell lines. Candidate molecular markers predicting sensitivity were assessed by baseline gene expression profiling, ELISA, and western blot analyses. Multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis was used to study the interactions between chemotherapeutic drugs and lapatinib. Concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects of lapatinib were seen in all endometrial cancer cell lines tested, but varied significantly between individual cell lines (IC(50) range: 0.052-10.9 micromol). HER2 overexpression or increased expression of EGFR was significantly associated with in vitro sensitivity (P=0.024 or 0.011, respectively). Lapatinib exerts growth inhibition in a PTEN-independent manner. Sensitive cell lines also exhibited increased expression of EGFR ligands or HER3. In contrast, lapatinib-resistant cell lines exhibited high androgen receptor (AR) levels or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (post-EMT) features. In endometrial cancer cells, at a wide range of clinically achievable drug concentrations, additive and synergistic interactions were observed for lapatinib plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and doxorubicin. These observations provide a clear biologic rational to test lapatinib as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in endometrial cancer with HER2 overexpression. Expression of EGFR, its ligands, HER3, AR, and post-EMT markers warrant further evaluation to help define patients with HER2-nonoverexpressing endometrial cancer most likely to benefit from lapatinib.},

abstract={There was no responsibility provided in the old Criminal Code (1961 year) for the crimes of illegal disposal of an electronic non-cash payment instrument. The responsibility for such acts has been set since 2003. This new law has caused many problems concerning the practical proceedings of law enforcement agencies. The author have collected some urgent problems and tried to solve them out. Some crime features are described as alternative by the law. In such a law an act could be described presenting several features. Such crimes could be committed either by one or several of the acts. If a crime has been committed by one act or several acts, such an act is considered to be one crime according to the Criminal Code. The act features of the crimes provided in the Criminal Code (Article 214 - illegal acquisition, possession, transfer or realization and Article 215 - illegal initiation or transaction of financial operation) are set out as alternative, therefore the following acts must be qualified as one crime. When a criminal, paying with an electronic non-cash payment instrument, signs a check, such an act is not separately qualified as forgery. Courts' practice says that signing a check is a part of a crime described in the Criminal Code (Ar- ticle 215) and is a part of illegal initiation or transaction of financial operation. Author argues that such signing is a part of fraud, but not a part of illegal initiation or transaction of financial operation. Responsibility for the fraud has been set out, if the value of illegally acquired property is more than 130 Litas (1 Minimum Living Standard). When criminal used electronic non-cash payment instrument and his obtained property value is more than 130 Litas, his act must be qualified according to the Articles 182 and 215 as fraud and illegal initiation of financial operation, and Article 300 as forgery. However, if the value of illegally acquired property is less than 130 Litas, the signing of the check can not be qualified as fraud according to the Article 182 but must be qualified according to the Article 300 as a forgery and Article 215 as illegal initiation of financial operation. When a criminal using the same payment instrument performs several financial operations, it is necessary to decide whether there is one continuous crime in his/her actions or several separate crimes. If several crimes, pursuant to the Criminal Code (Articles 215 and 182), are committed and they have the features of continuous acts, such actions are qualified as one crime. It is problematic when a criminal pays with an electronic payment instrument belonging to another person several times thus acquiring other person's property and is detained having used this payment instrument for several times. In such situations the actions of a criminal that were stopped at the attempt phase are not qualified separately as an attempt to commit a crime but are deemed to be a part of a continuous crime. A crime is qualified considering the fact whether malice prepense is defined or not. When a criminal commits a crime with defined malice prepense, his/her criminal act is qualified according to the consequences that he/she tried to attain, whereas when there is no defined malice prepense, criminal acts are qualified according to the consequences that occured.},

abstract={In June 1980, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) recognized emergency medicine as a free-standing specialty requiring 4 years of residency training. (This was subsequently extended to 5 years.) Concurrently, the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) identified the need to upgrade emergency medicine education for family physicians (FPs) and created the administrative framework for a 1-year training program. As a result, emergency care in Canada today is provided by a heterogeneous group of clinicians. In urban centres, emergency departments are staffed by specialists who hold fellowships from the RCPSC (FRCPCs), FPs with certificates of special competence in emergency medicine from the CFPC (CCFP-EMs) and progressively fewer FPs and clinicians with a general licence.' The situation is different in smaller regional and rural hospitals, where the latter 2 groups provide virtually all emergency care. This diversity of emergency care providers reflects the varied educational, economic and geographic realities of our vast country, and it is further complicated by an overall shortage of Canadian emergency physicians.2-4 Moorehead and colleagues5 have calculated that, in the United States, physicians certified or trained in emergency medicine fill 58% of full-time-equivalent positions in acute care hospitals, and FPs and internists account for most of the rest. Adapting their formula to a Canadian setting, we can calculate that physicians certified in emergency medicine in this country fill about 45% of full-time-equivalent positions and that FPs fill the rest. In the United States, 124 emergency medicine training programs produce 1136 graduates each year.6 In Canada, at present, there are 27 training programs: 11 for FRCPCs and 16 for CCFP-EMs, with 20 and 70 postgraduate entry positions, respectively.7,8 Even with 2 educational tracks, the proportion of residency positions that are in emergency medicine is 21% lower in Canada than in the United States. Future urban emergency practice should become the domain of physicians certified in this speciality, whether FRCPCs or CCFP-EMs. Emergency departments in larger centres are the entry points for patients who present with increasingly more acute or complex medical, psychological or social problems. It is appropriate that practitioners with the most intensive training should carry out patient care, clinical teaching and research in those settings. FRCPCs will be able to draw upon their preparation for academic work and didactic teaching and by virtue of their training in family medicine, CCCFP-EMs will be able to apply their humanistic skills to patient care and clinical teaching.11 FPs will continue to be responsible for providing much of the emergency care in our rural settings. Although training in emergency skills for FPs is, overall, too short, we may expect that the further development of educational resources for emergency medicine in core family medicine programs will enhance the quality of emergency care in nonurban settings.},

abstract={The sexual exploitation of these women is made possible through the racialization of gender and sexuality--or what Hurtado calls "the dual construction of womanhood" (844). The definition and constitution of woman is different for Aboriginal women and women of colour. Access to power and privilege is restricted. In the First Nations context, as Aboriginal women and their families migrate to urban centres to escape the poverty and social disorganization found in rural settings, the reality is that despite "formal" equality of opportunity, they are faced with an explosion of identities and qualitatively different problems, such as a lack of affordable housing, restricted access to jobs that pay a living wage, and tensions surrounding their socio-cultural values about family and sexual culture.(f.3) Given the complex hierarchies of gender (masculinities/femininities), ethnicity ("domestic"/"exotic"),(f.4) and sexuality (hetero/homosexualities), the intersections of otherness pose significant problems for Aboriginal women and women of colour, and there is no mistaking that they fare less well than non-ethnic, "white" women in terms of the social, economic, and cultural distribution of resources in contemporary Canadian society. The difficulties stemming from these hierarchies can be seen in the family (Hill Collins), economic and educational institutions (Mann), and forms of cultural expression (Ng). The irony however, is that in the intersection of race/ethnicity and sexuality, what was, by itself largely invisible, now becomes all too visible and is used to justify racist and sexist behaviours on the part of law enforcement, legal, and correctional officials. They are left with a double bind. When these women remain in dependent situations and in largely rural areas, they are seen as powerless in their ability to help themselves and their families. When they choose to leave their communities, however, in search of economic and social self-determination they are seen as "too" powerful or dangerous, and as not committed to their communities of origin or their families. Historical engagements with sexuality in general, and adolescent sexuality in particular, are difficult to track, given both the quantitative and qualitative changes within and across various communities. According to Rhode, prior to the nineteenth century, attitudes toward early child-bearing and sexual activities among adolescents were relatively permissive.(f.1) Although fornication was forcefully punished, intimacy in the context of courtship was greeted for most, with less hostility. If, for example, a young woman became pregnant, it was, and some would argue still is, expected that she marry, effectively moving her from her father's house (and control) to her husband's. As technology increased and the grasp of industry extended over individual's lives, communities became destabilized in the face of economic turmoil and increased geographic mobility. Sex became a commodity--something that had value outside the confines and control of courtship and marriage, resulting in an increase in out-of- wedlock births and premarital sexual relations without the intention of marriage, and a decline in the prevailing "moral" climate. As a way to increase levels of control over women's bodies and sexuality, religious reform movements emerged on the scene to save women, not from the sexual exploitation of men, but from themselves, and to protect the public interest of chastity and virtue (D'Emilio and Freedman). In Canada, this process began with the nineteenth-century "Child Saving Movement" as a way to protect young women from the temptations of urban life (Valverde). This movement emerged within the context of a "cult of domesticity" that valued, for women, their moral and righteous positions in the home as obedient mothers, wives, and daughters (Kemp). This moral stance was quickly integrated into a "scientific" and medical model that recast female sexuality as a social problem, not simply a moral dilemma. The medicalization of sexuality emerged against a cultural backdrop that was concerned with the "amoral" behaviour of middle-class youth and the gradual deregulation of the sexual lives of single women. Under this medical framework, adolescent sexuality became a pathology, and its symptoms were pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases, and "impurity." In short, sexuality became something to be controlled, much like a chronic disease, subject to the intervention of the male-dominated medical community (Nathanson).},

abstract={In an occupational situation where men and women work at relatively the same grade or pay level the cultural model often causes personal conflicts with the reality of employment competition. For centuries the cultural model was perpetuated in traditional patterns, one being separate occupational for the sexes, thereby avoiding competitiveness between men and women for most jobs. Certain occupations became traditionally "fenced off" as being exclusively the province of one sex or the other. the military profession evolved historically and sociologically as one of the most "male" occupations. From ancient times, societies have conferred upon seasoned soldiers the honor and status of "men," differentiating male adulthood from male youth in the manner that primitive societies mark adulthood with "rites of passage" (1:32-33). The way most men view this profession is best understood in relation to the concept of bonding. The term "bonding" connotes the exclusiveness of a group organized to pursue common interests, or goals. In professions where members anticipate the prospect of facing life-or-death situations, bonding is a necessary phenomenon, e.g., law enforcement and fire-fighting. In military life, through endurance of common hardships and performance of concerted actions under conditions of extreme austerity, bonding among soldiers galvanizes the spirit to fight hard and well to win battles. Leadership is a key factor in developing group cohesiveness, but the commitment and expertise of each individual of the group is crucial to reinforcing the confidence of all other members. In civic clubs of closed membership, such as the Lions, Rotary, Kiwanis, fraternities and sororities, a primary value to members is the sharing of self-affirmation and loyalty to the group that results from association with competent persons of one's own sex (9:274-279). Men, as equals in male groups, measure themselves in relation to other members, developing confidence and self-esteem through comradeship. Women have similar needs and receive encouragement and esteem through their groups. The success of bonding also relates to the status of the group as perceived by its members in linkage with their own individual identities. The "crashing" of a closed membership by an outsider is frequently resisted because the perceptions of the members regarding the group will then be changed. The value of the organization to the original members may lesson as when a woman joins a male group, the implication being that the status and identity relationships have been altered because of her presence (4:171). The character of a mixed group is different from that of an all-female or an all-male group. When quality bonding is present, people tend to take it for granted, its absence is much more noticeable. For example, I felt that members of the Women's Army Corps (WAC) were well-bonded in separate units, just as the men were in theirs. The feeling of bonding began in basic training and was very strong among female soldiers in permanent party units. Women are dispersed now throughout the Army, and in places where only a few females are assigned they may feel isolated. It is a healthy sign that in some units bonding is developing between assigned men and women in a kind of brother-sister relationship (7:24-25). But just because a soldier has joined a unit does not mean he or she is an accepted member, and I believe the absence of bonding is an important factor that makes some soldiers more sensitive today about their overall treatment in the Army. The question of whether the quality of bonding is as strong in units of mixed sexes as it is in all-male or all-female units may merit further study. Again, the issue is important as it affects cohesiveness among soldiers to prepare for and to win in combat (11:71-81, 141-142). Another way the Army keeps the sexist model "up front" is by condoning sexist humor. Most Army schools probably have policies against the use of sexist jokes, but in several that I attended the use of such jokes has been common. An instructor does not have to be very creative in getting the attention of the class as long as a dirty joke is readily available (as it almost always is). On occasions when a joke was not told, the instructor explained that it would not be told because a woman was present in the class. That statement, plus the groan of at least reigned disappointment among male classmates, was yet another way of telling me that I didn't belong in the "club". In fact, I know that some male soldiers also object to the sexist jokes but, like me, they have suffered them rather than be singled out for "spoiling the pleasure of others" by complaining about the practice.},
