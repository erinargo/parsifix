To this end, we present the integration of an augmented reality system that will be used to train military medics in airway management. The system demonstrates how a head-mounted projective display can be integrated with a desktop PC to create an augmented reality visualization. Furthermore, the system, which uses a lightweight optical tracker, demonstrates the low cost and the portability of the application.}

 abstract     = {As mass casualty incidents continue to escalate in the United States, we must improve frontline responder performance to increase the odds of victim survival. In this article, we describe the First Responder Virtual Reality Simulator, a high-fidelity, fully immersive, automated, programmable virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to train frontline responders to treat and triage victims of mass casualty incidents. First responder trainees don a wireless VR head-mounted display linked to a compatible desktop computer. Trainees see and hear autonomous, interactive victims who are programmed to simulate individuals with injuries consistent with an explosion in an underground space. Armed with a virtual medical kit, responders are tasked with triaging and treating the victims on the scene. The VR environment can be made more challenging by increasing the environmental chaos, adding patients, or increasing the acuity of patient injuries. The VR platform tracks and records their performance as they navigate the disaster scene. Output from the system provides feedback to participants on their performance. Eventually, we hope that the First Responder system will serve both as an effective replacement for expensive conventional training methods as well as a safe and efficient platform for research on current triage protocols.}

This systematic review identified how accelerometers and inertial measurement units are currently being used to quantify movement patterns of tactical athletes. Seven research and military databases were searched, producing 26,228 potential articles with 78 articles included in this review. The articles studied military personnel (73.1{\%}), firefighters (19.2{\%}), paramedics (3.8{\%}), and law enforcement officers (3.8{\%}). Accelerometers were the most used type of sensor, and physical activity was the primarily reported outcome variable. Seventy of the studies had fair or poor quality. Research on firefighters, emergency medical services, and law enforcement officers was limited. Future research should strive to make quantified movement data more accessible and user-friendly for non-research personnel, thereby prompting increased use in tactical athlete groups, especially first responder agencies.}

The fire fighters were exposed to high physiological workloads (heart rates of up to 180 beats per minute) and walked considerable distances at the fires. Results from this study have been used in presentations to fire fighters and non-operational fire personnel to understand the pressures fire fighters are under and how others complete the fire fighting tasks.}

The anatomical features and individual calculations make such an emergency much more error-prone than a comparable adult emergency. Particularly in dose calculations, critical errors occur time and again. Since these calculations are based on the child's weight, which is preclinically often derived from the size of the child, the number of errors can be minimized with an assistance service that performs all calculations based on the size. Technically, it is possible to detect the size with a depth camera, which is occasionally installed in smartphones or head-mounted displays. In order to investigate to what extent these cameras provide precise results, a study with 33 children was carried out. The children were measured with both an emergency ruler and an augmented reality app with associated smartphone with depth camera. The result is that the depth camera does not provide significantly different results than an emergency ruler. This allows further research, e.g. the automatic recognition of patients with the help of machine learning or usability studies, to be tackled.}

We reviewed studies that examined HWDs in emergency response contexts to evaluate the impact of HWDs on team performance and on team processes of situation awareness, communication, and coordination. Sixteen studies were identified through manual and systematic literature searches. HWDs appeared to improve the quality of team performance but they increased time to perform under some conditions; effects on team processes were mixed. We identify five challenges to explain the mixed results. We discuss four theoretical perspectives that might address the challenges and guide research needs-joint cognitive systems, distributed cognition, common ground, and dynamical systems. Researchers and designers should use process-based measures and apply greater theoretical guidance to uncover mechanisms by which HWDs shape team processes, and to understand the impact on team performance. Practitioner Summary: This review examines the effects of head-worn displays on teamwork performance and team processes for emergency response. Results are mixed, but study diversity challenges the search for underlying mechanisms. Guidance from perspectives such as joint cognitive systems, distributed cognition, common ground, and dynamical systems may advance knowledge in the area.

As such, novel training methods have emerged to prepare and adequately train MFRs for these challenging situations. Particular focus should be placed on extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR, AR, and MR, respectively), and allows participants to develop high-quality skills in realistic and immersive environments. Given the rapid evolution of high-fidelity simulation technology and its advantages, XR simulation has become a promising tool for emergency medicine. Accordingly, this systematic review aims to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of XR training methods and 2) explore the experience of MFRs undergoing such training.METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy will encompass four distinct themes: MFRs, disasters/MCIs, education and simulation, and XR. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACs) will be searched along with an in-depth examination of the grey literature and reference lists of relevant articles. MetaQAT will be used as a study quality assessment tool and integrated into Covidence as part of the data extraction form. Given the predicted high heterogeneity between studies, it may not be possible to standardise data for quantitative comparison and meta-analysis. Thus, data will be synthesised in a narrative, semi-quantitative manner.DISCUSSION: This review will examine the existing literature on the effectiveness of XR simulation as a tool to train MFRs for MCIs, which could ultimately improve preparedness and response to disasters.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42021275692.}

Remote expert surgeons guided first responders through training cricothyroidotomies in a simulated austere scenario, and on-site surgeons evaluated the participants using standardized evaluation tools. The evaluation comprehended completion time and technique performance of specific cricothyroidotomy steps. The analyses were also performed considering the participants' years of experience as first responders, and their experience performing cricothyroidotomies.

The original 2013 Farm Mapping to Assist, Protect and Prepare Emergency Responders (Farm MAPPER) project was undertaken to develop a method to give emergency responders an up-to-date view of on-farm hazard information to safely and efficiently conduct emergency response activities on private agricultural operations. In 2017, an augmented reality version of Farm MAPPER was developed to combine the technological advantages of geographic information system-based data points with a heads-up display and graphical overlay of superimposed hazard imagery and informative icons.

As part of these efforts, migrating from traditional land mobile radio (LMR) systems toward cellular-enabled, next-generation, mission-critical networks is at the top of these agencies' agendas. In this paper, we provide an overview of cellular technologies ratified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to enable next-generation public safety networks. On top of using wireless communication technologies, emergency first responders need to be equipped with advanced devices to develop situational awareness. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the Internet of Life-Saving Things (IoLST) and focus on the role of wearable devices-more precisely, cellular-enabled wearables, in creating new solutions for enhanced public safety operations. Finally, we conduct a performance evaluation of wearable-based, mission-critical applications. So far, most of the mission-critical service evaluations target latency performance without taking into account reliability requirements. In our evaluation, we examine the impact of device- and application-related parameters on the latency and the reliability performance. We also identify major future considerations for better support of the studied requirements in next-generation public safety networks.}

Anatomical peculiarities and individual adjustments make treatment during pediatric emergency susceptible to error. Critical mistakes especially occur in the calculation of weight-based drug doses. Accordingly, the need for a ubiquitous assistance service that can, for example, automate dose calculation is high. However, few approaches exist due to the complexity of the problem.OBJECTIVE: Technically, an assistance service is possible, among other approaches, with an app that uses a depth camera that is integrated in smartphones or head-mounted displays to provide a 3D understanding of the environment. The goal of this study was to automate this technology as much as possible to develop and statistically evaluate an assistance service that does not have significantly worse measurement performance than an emergency ruler (the state of the art).METHODS: An assistance service was developed that uses machine learning to recognize patients and then automatically determines their size. Based on the size, the weight is automatically derived, and the dosages are calculated and presented to the physician. To evaluate the app, a small within-group design study was conducted with 17 children, who were each measured with the app installed on a smartphone with a built-in depth camera and a state-of-the-art emergency ruler.RESULTS: According to the statistical results (one-sample t test; P=.42; alpha=.05), there is no significant difference between the measurement performance of the app and an emergency ruler under the test conditions (indoor, daylight). The newly developed measurement method is thus not technically inferior to the established one in terms of accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: An assistance service with an integrated augmented reality emergency ruler is technically possible, although some groundwork is still needed. The results of this study clear the way for further research, for example, usability testing.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) apps offer potential support for emergency responders in rural areas.OBJECTIVE: In this report, we described lessons learned from the development process of augmented reality (AR) Farm Mapping to Assist, Protect and Prepare Emergency Responders (MAPPER), a MAR app that provides emergency responders onsite information about the agricultural operation they enter.METHODS: Cross-platform frameworks were used to create AR MAPPER to accommodate budget constraints and overcome issues with markerless MAR technologies. Although the single codebase and Web technologies streamlined development, cross-device hardware limitations impacted location accuracy, lengthened the development cycle, and required regular updates to third-party libraries.RESULTS: A hybrid development approach of using Web-based technologies with native tie-ins for specialized components and enhanced performance cut time and costs. This also led to consistency across multiple platforms and ensured that there is only a single set of source files to modify for Android and iPhone operating systems. Meanwhile, active development was delayed by some major hurdles. Apple and Google both released new versions of their operating systems, and the Wikitude framework issued four major updates, each of which brought with it some important enhancements and also led to some new issues.CONCLUSIONS: Developers should consider single platform native development to benefit from platform-specific MAR implementations and to avoid development, testing, and maintenance costs associated with cross-platform implementation. Emergency response organizations may be more likely to utilize a single platform across the devices used by their command staff. This also reduces the benefits of cross-platform development. Furthermore, providing map-based, non-AR cross-platform apps for landowners, farmers, and ranchers would help improve and maintain data quality, which is crucial for the utility and user experience of MAR apps.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Pediatric emergencies are high-stakes yet low-volume clinical encounters for emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians, necessitating innovative approaches to training. We sought to explore the acceptability, usability, and ergonomics of a novel augmented reality (AR) software for EMS crisis management training.METHODS: This was a prospective, mixed-methods study employing qualitative and quantitative analyses. We enrolled emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics at a municipal fire service in Northern California. We ran the Chariot Augmented Reality Medical simulation software (Stanford Chariot Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA)on the ML1 headset (Magic Leap, Inc., Plantation, FL), which enabled participants to view an AR image of a patient overlaid with real-world training objects. Participants completed a simulation of a pediatric hypoglycemia-induced seizure and cardiac arrest. Participants subsequently engaged in structured focus group interviews assessing acceptability, which we coded and thematically analyzed. We evaluated the usability of the AR system and ergonomics of the ML1 headset using previously validated scales, and we analyzed findings with descriptive statistics.RESULTS: Twenty-two EMS clinicians participated. We categorized focus group interview statements into seven domains after an iterative thematic analysis: general appraisal, realism, learning efficacy, mixed reality feasibility, technology acceptance, software optimization, and alternate use cases. Participants valued the realism and the mixed reality functionality of the training simulation. They reported that AR could be effective for practicing pediatric clinical algorithms and task prioritization, building verbal communication skills, and promoting stress indoctrination. However, participants also noted challenges with integrating AR images with real-world objects, the learning curve required to adapt to the technology, and areas for software improvement. Participants favorably evaluated the ease of use of the technology and comfortability of wearing the hardware; however, most participants reported that they would need technical support.CONCLUSION: Participants positively evaluated the acceptability, usability, and ergonomics of an AR simulator for pediatric emergency management training, and participants identified current technological limitations and areas for improvement. AR simulation may serve as an effective training adjunct for prehospital clinicians.}

Furthermore, more advanced electronic sensors including location traking sensor, thermal imaging caerma, toxic gas detectors, and even physiological monitoring sensors are being integrated into ensemble elements for better protection of firefighters from fire sites. Despite any electronic equipment placed on the firefighter must withstand environmental extremes and continue to properly function under any thermal conditions that firefighters routinely face, there are no specific criteria for these electronics to define functionability of these devices under given thermal conditions. Although manufacturers provide the specifications and performance guidelines for their products, their operation guidelines hardly match the real thermal conditions.

A rich user interface was implemented that provides 3D visual aids including images, text and tracked 3D overlays corresponding to each task that needs to be performed. A user study with 20 participants is conducted which involves training of two tasks where each subject performs one task with the HMD and the other with standard training. Two evaluations were performed, with the first immediately after the training followed by a second one three weeks later.

Less has been done on the accurate testing and assessment of this instrumentation, especially when considering devices thought to be used in harsh environments by subjects or operators performing intense physical activities. This paper presents methodology and results of the evaluation of wearable physiological sensors under these conditions. The methodology has been applied to a specific textile-based prototype, aimed at the real-time monitoring of rescuers in emergency contexts, which has been developed within a European funded project called ProeTEX. Wearable sensor measurements have been compared with the ones of suitable gold standards through Bland-Altman statistical analysis; tests were realized in controlled environments simulating typical intervention conditions, with temperatures ranging from 20{\textdegree}C to 45{\textdegree}C and subjects performing mild to very intense activities. This evaluation methodology demonstrated to be effective for the definition of the limits of use of wearable sensors. Furthermore, the ProeTEX prototype demonstrated to be reliable, since it produced negligible errors when used for up to 1 h in normal environmental temperature (20{\textdegree}C and 35{\textdegree}C) and up to 30 min in harsher environment (45{\textdegree}C).}

 abstract     = {The 2022 Winter Olympics were held in the three competition zones of Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, China. The venues of this Winter Olympics were scattered and the terrain was complex. Moreover, the medical resources of Hebei and Beijing were relatively unbalanced. In the medical security of major events, the connection between first aid and in-hospital processes is of the utmost importance to rescue quality. 5th generation mobile network (5G) applications in medical scenarios are on the rise. It would be of great relevance to fully use 5G's low-latency and high-speed features to share the process information of patients, ambulance personnel, and the destination hospital's rescue team at emergency scenes and in transportation, improving rescue efficiency. This paper proposes a system scheme of cross-institutional emergency health information sharing based on 5G and augmented reality wearable devices. It also integrates the construction method of monitoring and other sign data sharing, in addition to testing the proposed scheme's service quality in 5G environments. In the deployment area of the 5G emergency medical rescue information sharing scheme for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, we selected two designated medical support institutions for testing. The test adopted a combination of fixed-point and driving tests to experiment on the service data, voice service, and streaming media indicators. The 5G signal's coverage rate was close to 100{\%}, the standalone connection's success rate was 100{\%}, and the drop rate was 0. The average downlink rate of multiple scenarios was 620mbps, and the average uplink rate of 5G was over 71.8mbps, which is higher than the average 5G level in China. The downlink rate was more than 20 times larger than the 4th generation mobile network (4G) rate. This study's proposed scheme demonstrates the importance of 5G applications in emergency response and support, in addition to providing a suitable scheme for the integration of 5G networks in the medical scene.}

 abstract     = {Fire service personnel and private ambulance paramedics suffer musculoskeletal injuries as they lift and carry patients while performing emergency medical services (EMS). Engineering changes, such as the design of new EMS patient-handling devices, offer a potential intervention opportunity for combating this problem. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to generate beginning ideas for the design of new EMS patient-handling devices that were framed within the contextual reality of the end user firefighter/paramedics. Guided by an ecological model of musculoskeletal injuries in the fire service, focus groups were conducted with 25 firefighter/paramedics from 13 suburban fire departments. Based on their availability, participants were assigned to one of three groups with each group focusing on a different EMS patient-handling scenario. Each group participated in two focus group sessions: one session to brainstorm ideas for devices and a second session to validate sketches of their design ideas. The sketches were professionally drawn by an industrial designer who attended all focus group sessions. Sketches, photos, videotapes, and written transcripts were content analyzed to describe the phenomena of interest. The ideas centered on EMS devices for lateral transfers, bed-to-stairchair transfers, and stair descent transport, and served as the starting point for the development of EMS devices in subsequent phases of a mixed method research study. The outcomes of this study were an improved understanding of the contextual issues that need to be considered in designing EMS patient handling devices and a set of industrial design sketches that served as a starting point for subsequent development of the devices. End user acceptance criteria for the devices included: affordability, portability/compactness, durability, operability including being quickly ready for use, and cleanability.}

 abstract     = {Currently, visual Augmented Reality (AR) technology is widespread among the public. Similarly, haptic AR technology is also widely practiced in the academic field. However, conventional haptic AR devices are not suitable for interacting with real objects. These devices are often held by the users, and they contact the real object via the devices. Thus, they prevent direct contact between the user and real objects. To solve this problem, we proposed employing Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) technology. EMS technology does not interfere with the interaction between the user and the real object, and the user can wear the device. First, we examined proper stimulus waveforms for EMS, in addition to pulse waveforms. At the same time, we examined the appropriate frequency and pulse width. The waveforms that we used this time were a sawtooth wave, a reverse sawtooth wave, and a sine wave. Second, to clarify the characteristic of the force presented by the EMS, we measured the relationship between the input voltage and the force presented and obtained the point of subjective equality using the constant method. Subsequently, we presented the bump sensation using EMS to the participants and verified its effectiveness by comparing it with the existing methods.}

 abstract     = {Background: Augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are highly disruptive technologies that have revolutionised practices in a wide range of domains, including the security sector. Several law enforcement agencies (LEAs) employ AI in their daily operations for forensics and surveillance. AR is also gaining traction in security, particularly with the advent of affordable wearable devices. Equipping police officers with the tools to facilitate an elevated situational awareness (SA) in patrolling and tactical scenarios is expected to improve LEAs' safety and capacity to deliver crucial blows against terrorist and/or criminal threats. Methods: In this paper we present DARLENE, an ecosystem incorporating novel AI techniques for activity recognition and pose estimation tasks, combined with a wearable AR framework for visualization of the inferenced results via dynamic content adaptation according to the wearer's stress level and operational context. The concept has been validated with end-users through co-creation workshops, while the decision-making mechanism for enhancing LEAs' SA has been assessed with experts. Regarding computer vision components, preliminary tests of the instance segmentation method for humans' and objects' detection have been conducted on a subset of videos from the RWF-2000 dataset for violence detection, which have also been used to test a human pose estimation method that has so far exhibited impressive results, constituting the basis of further developments in DARLENE. Results: Evaluation results highlight that target users are positive towards the adoption of the proposed solution in field operations, and that the SA decision-making mechanism produces highly acceptable outcomes. Evaluation of the computer vision components yielded promising results and identified opportunities for improvement. Conclusions: This work provides the context of the DARLENE ecosystem and presents the DARLENE architecture, analyses its individual technologies, and demonstrates preliminary results, which are positive both in terms of technological achievements and user acceptance of the proposed solution.}

 abstract     = {Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a common event, affecting almost 400,000 individuals annually in North America. Initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using an automated external defibrillator (AED) are critical for survival, yet many bystanders are reluctant to intervene. Digital technologies, including mobile devices, social media, and crowdsourcing might help play a role to improve survival from SCA. In this article we review the current digital tools and strategies available to increase rates of bystander recognition of SCA, prompt immediate activation of emergency medical services (EMS), initiate high-quality CPR, and to locate, retrieve, and operate AEDs. Smartphones can help to educate and connect bystanders with EMS dispatchers, through text messaging or video calling, to encourage the initiation of CPR and retrieval of the closest AED. Wearable devices and household smart speakers could play a future role in continuous vital signs monitoring in individuals at risk of lethal arrhythmias and send an alert to either chosen contacts or EMS. Machine learning algorithms and mathematical modelling might aid EMS dispatchers with better recognition of SCA as well as policymakers with where to best place AEDs for optimal accessibility. There are challenges with the use of digital tech, including the need for government regulation and issues with data ownership, accessibility, and interoperability. Future research will include smart cities, e-linkages, new technologies, and using social media for mass education. Together or in combination, these emerging digital technologies might represent the next leap forward in SCA survival.}

 abstract     = {Recent advances in techniques to improve indoor localization accuracy for personnel and asset tracking challenges has enabled wide-spread adoption within the retail, manufacturing, and health care industries. Most currently deployed systems use distance estimates from known reference locations to localize a person or asset using geometric lateration techniques. The distances are determined using one of many radio frequency (RF) based ranging techniques. Unfortunately, such techniques are susceptible to interference and multipath propagation caused by obstructions within buildings. Because range inaccuracies from known locations can directly lead to incorrect position estimates, these systems often require careful upfront deployment design to account for site-specific interference sources. However, the upfront system deployment requirements necessary to achieve high positioning accuracy with RF-based ranging systems makes the use of such systems impractical, particularly for structures constructed of challenging materials or dense configurations. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the accuracy and precision of alternative RF-based devices within a range of indoor spaces composed of different materials and sizes. These spaces range from large open areas such as gymnasiums to confined engineering labs of traditional buildings as well as training buildings at the local Fire Department Training Facility. Our goal is to identify the impact of alternative RF-based systems on localization accuracy and precision specifically for first responders that are called upon to traverse structures composed of different materials and configurations. Consequently, in this study we have specifically chosen spaces that are likely to be encountered by firefighters during building fires or emergency medical responses. Moreover, many of these indoor spaces can be considered hostile using RF-based ranging techniques. We built prototype wearable localization edge devices designed for first responders and characterize both ranging and localization accuracy and precision using alternative transceivers including Bluetooth Low Energy, 433 MHz, 915 MHz, and ultra-wide band. Our results show that in hostile environments, using ultra-wide band transceivers for localization consistently outperforms the alternatives in terms of precision and accuracy.}

A promising emerging approach to overcoming the inherent biologic constraints of patient capacity to self-detect and respond to stroke symptoms is continuous monitoring by mobile health technologies with wireless sensors and artificial intelligence recognition systems. This review surveys 11 sensing technologies - accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors, touch screen and keyboard input detectors, artificial vision, and artificial hearing; and 10 consumer device form factors in which they are increasingly implemented: smartphones, smart speakers, smart watches and fitness bands, smart speakers/voice assistants, home health robots, smart clothing, smart beds, closed circuit television, smart rings, and desktop/laptop/tablet computers.CONCLUSIONS: The increase in computing power, wearable sensors, and mobile connectivity have ushered in an array of mobile health technologies that can transform stroke detection and EMS activation. By continuously monitoring a diverse range of biometric parameters, commercially available devices provide the technologic capability to detect cardinal language, motor, gait, and sensory signs of stroke onset. Intensified translational research to convert the promise of these technologies to validated, accurate real-world deployments are an important next priority for stroke investigation.}

 abstract     = {Introduction Research suggests Emergency Medical Services (EMS) over-use in urban cities is partly due to substance users with limited access to medical/social services. Recent efforts to deliver brief, motivational messages to encourage these individuals to enter treatment have not considered EMS providers. Problem Little research has been done with EMS providers who serve substance-using patients. The EMS providers were interviewed about participating in a pilot program where they would be trained to screen their patients for substance abuse and encourage them to enter drug treatment.METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD; Baltimore, Maryland USA) EMS providers (N=22). Topics included EMS misuse, work demands, and views on participating in the pilot program. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory and constant-comparison.RESULTS: Participants were mostly white (68.1{\%}); male (68.2{\%}); with Advanced Life Skills training (90.9{\%}). Mean age was 37.5 years. Providers described the "frequent flyer problem" (eg, EMS over-use by a few repeat non-emergent cases). Providers expressed disappointment with local health delivery due to resource limitations and being excluded from decision making within their administration, leading to reduced team morale and burnout. Nonetheless, providers acknowledged they are well-positioned to intervene with substance-using patients because they are in direct contact and have built rapport with them. They noted patients might be most receptive to motivational messages immediately after overdose revival, which several called "hitting their bottom." Several stated that involvement with the proposed study would be facilitated by direct incorporation into EMS providers' current workflow. Many recommended that research team members accompany EMS providers while on-call to observe their day-to-day work. Barriers identified by the providers included time constraints to intervene, limited knowledge of substance abuse treatment modalities, and fearing negative repercussions from supervisors and/or patients. Despite reservations, several EMS providers expressed inclination to deliver brief motivational messages to encourage substance-using patients to consider treatment, given adequate training and skill-building.CONCLUSIONS: Emergency Medical Service providers may have many demands, including difficult case time/resource limitations. Even so, participants recognized their unique position as first responders to deliver motivational, harm-reduction messages to substance-using patients during transport. With incentivized training, implementing this program could be life- and cost-saving, improving emergency and behavioral health services. Findings will inform future efforts to connect substance users with drug treatment, potentially reducing EMS over-use in Baltimore. Maragh-Bass AC , Fields JC , McWilliams J , Knowlton AR .

Prior research has examined the implementation of training systems using augmented reality (AR) in other domains, such as welding, aviation, army, and mathematics, offering significant pedagogical affordances. Nevertheless, firefighting training systems using AR are still an under-researched area. The increasing penetration of AR for training is the driving force behind this study, and the scope is to analyze the main aspects affecting the acceptance of AR by firefighters. The current research uses a technology acceptance model, extended by the external constructs of perceived interactivity and personalization, to consider both the system and individual level. The proposed model was evaluated by a sample of 200 users, and the results show that both the external variables of perceived interactivity and perceived personalization are prerequisite factors in extending the TAM model. The findings reveal that the usability is the strongest predictor of firefighters' behavioral intentions to use the AR system, followed by the ease of use with smaller, yet meaningful, direct and indirect effects on firefighters' intentions. The identified acceptance factors help AR developers enhance the firefighters' experience in training operations.}

With this purpose, we performed proof-of-concept experiments with a bio-signal sensor suite worn by firefighters in two high-fidelity SAR exercises. Moreover, we conducted a survey, distributed to end-users through the Fire Brigade consortium of the Provincial Council of Malaga, in order to analyze the firefighters' opinion about biological signals monitoring while on duty.

Automation of the triage process is still a challenging task. The goal of the paper is to propose a novel algorithm for automation of medical emergency protocol in the military environment by the creation of classifiers that can provide accurate prioritization of injured soldier cases. It is a part of a complex military telemedicine system that provides continuous monitoring of soldiers' vital data gathered on-site using an unobtrusive set of sensors.METHODS: After pre-processing the collected raw physiological data and eliminating the outliers using Naive Bayesian Classifier, the system is capable of calculating the risk level and categorizing the victims based on Markov Decision Process. The NBC has been trained with a dataset that has contained labels and 6 features. Training set has held 8000 randomly chosen samples. Twenty percent of the determined dataset has been used for the validation set.RESULTS: For algorithm verification, several evaluation scenarios have been created. In each scenario, randomly generated vital sign data describing the hypothetical health condition of soldiers was contemporarily assessed by the system as well as by 50 experienced military medical physicians.CONCLUSION: The obtained correlation result of the proposed algorithm and medical physicians' classifications is strong evidence that the system can be implemented in warfare emergency medicine.}

Reporting bias was assessed. Study quality was evaluated by the Kirkpatrick's Level of evidence and the Machine Learning to Asses Surgical Expertise (MLASE) score.RESULTS: Of 422 papers identified, 14 met inclusion criteria, included 282 enrolled subjects, 20{\%} were surgeons, the remainder students, medics and non-surgeon physicians. Study design was poor and sample sizes were low. No data analyses were beyond descriptive and the highest outcome types were procedural success, subjective self-reports, except three studies used validated metrics. Among the 14 studies, Kirkpatrick's level of evidence was level zero in five studies, level 1 in 8 and level 2 in one. Only one study had MLASE Score greater than 9/20. There was a high risk of bias in 6 studies, uncertain bias in 5 studies and low risk of bias in 3 studies.CONCLUSIONS: There was inadequate evidence that VR,MR,AR or haptic interfaces can facilitate training for open trauma surgery or replace cadavers. Because of limited testing in surgeons, deficient study and technology design, risk of reporting bias, no current well-designed studies of computer-supported technologies have shown benefit for open trauma, emergency surgery nor has their use shown improved patient outcomes. Larger more rigorously designed studies and evaluations by experienced surgeons are required for a greater variety of procedures and skills.COMPETENCIES: Medical Knowledge, Practice Based Learning and Improvement, Patient Care, Systems-Based Practice.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: The challenging environment of prehospital casualty care demands providers to make prompt decisions and to engage in lifesaving interventions, occasionally without them being adequately experienced. Telementoring based on augmented reality (AR) devices has the potential to decrease the decision time and minimise the distance gap between an experienced consultant and the first responder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether telementoring with AR glasses would affect chest thoracotomy performance and self-confidence of inexperienced trainees.METHODS: Two groups of inexperienced medical students performed a chest thoracotomy in an ex vivo pig model. While one group was mentored remotely using HoloLens AR glasses, the second performed the procedure independently. An observer assessed the trainees' performance. In addition, trainees and mentors evaluated their own performance.RESULTS: Quality of performance was found to be superior with remote guidance, without significant prolongation of the procedure (492s vs 496s, p=0.943). Moreover, sense of self-confidence among participant was substantially improved in the telementoring group in which 100{\%} of the participants believed the procedure was successful compared with 40{\%} in the control group (p=0.035).CONCLUSION: AR devices may have a role in future prehospital telementoring systems, to provide accessible consultation for first responders, and could thus positively affect the provider's confidence in decision-making, enhance procedure performance and ultimately improve patient prognosis. That being said, future studies are required to estimate full potential of this technology and additional adjustments are necessary for maximal optimisation and implementation in the field of prehospital care.}

 abstract     = {The management of nutrition, food, and health for disaster relief personnel is one of the crucial aspects for carrying out effective rescue activities during large-scale natural disasters, such as a big earthquake, flooding, and landslide following heavy rainfall or man-made disasters, such as widespread fire in industrial areas. Rescue workers, such as fire fighters and rescue teams who work on the disaster relief operations, have to work long, hard, and irregular hours that require energy (both intake and expenditure), with especially altered eating patterns. Reliable estimates of the energy expenditure (TEE) for such disaster relief operations have not been fully established. Here, we propose to clarify the energy expenditure for each type of large-scale disaster activity conducted by fire fighters. Thirty fire fighters (survey participants in this research) who participated in the simulation training of large-scale disaster activities wore tri-axial accelerometers and heart rate monitors during training; and, post-training, 28 fire fighters submitted complete activity record tables. An estimation formula combining tri-axial accelerometer and heart rate monitor data was used. Additionally, energy expenditure per hour (excluding resting energy expenditure: REE) (per average body weight of participants) was calculated for 10 types of large-scale disaster response activities. We propose utilization of these data as a reference value for examining the TEE of firefighting and rescue operations in future large-scale disasters.}

A review is made of the relevant HUD literature, primarily from the aviation field. The primary issues for automotive HUDs relevant to system performance and safety in the driving task involve interference from background scene complexity, system novelty, user perceptual style, cognitive disruption, and perceptual tunnelling. Basic research is necessary to investigate the extent of these issues as well as to resolve fundamental design specifications (e.g. HUD size, shape, placement, information content). It is suggested that the introduction of HUDs into vehicles be carefully considered. This will necessitate not only the reconsideration what constitutes an in-vehicle display, but also what constitutes the information to be conveyed.}

 abstract     = {Traditionally, rural areas in many countries are limited by a lack of access to health care due to the inherent challenges associated with recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals. Telemedicine, which uses communication technology to deliver medical services over distance, is an economical and potentially effective way to address this problem. In this research, we develop a new telepresence application using an Augmented Reality (AR) system. We explore the use of the Microsoft HoloLens to facilitate and enhance remote medical training. Intrinsic advantages of AR systems enable remote learners to perform complex medical procedures such as Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) without visual interference. This research uses the HoloLens to capture the first-person view of a simulated rural emergency room (ER) through mixed reality capture (MRC) and serves as a novel telemedicine platform with remote pointing capabilities. The mentor's hand gestures are captured using a Leap Motion and virtually displayed in the AR space of the HoloLens. To explore the feasibility of the developed platform, twelve novice medical trainees were guided by a mentor through a simulated ultrasound exploration in a trauma scenario, as part of a pilot user study. The study explores the utility of the system from the trainees, mentor, and objective observers' perspectives and compares the findings to that of a more traditional multi-camera telemedicine solution. The results obtained provide valuable insight and guidance for the development of an AR-supported telemedicine platform.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have increasingly appeared in the medical literature in the past decade, with AR recently being studied for its potential role in remote health care delivery and communication. Recent literature describes AR's implementation in real-time telemedicine contexts across multiple specialties and settings, with remote emergency services in particular using AR to enhance disaster support and simulation education. Despite the introduction of AR in the medical literature and its potential to shape the future of remote medical services, studies have yet to investigate the perspectives of telemedicine providers regarding this novel technology.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the applications and challenges of AR in telemedicine anticipated by emergency medicine providers with a range of experiences in using telemedicine and AR or VR technology.METHODS: Across 10 academic medical institutions, 21 emergency medicine providers with variable exposures to telemedicine and AR or VR technology were recruited for semistructured interviews via snowball sampling. The interview questions focused on various potential uses of AR, anticipated obstacles that prevent its implementation in the telemedicine area, and how providers and patients might respond to its introduction. We included video demonstrations of a prototype using AR during the interviews to elicit more informed and complete insights regarding AR's potential in remote health care. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed via thematic coding.RESULTS: Our study identified 2 major areas of use for AR in telemedicine. First, AR is perceived to facilitate information gathering by enhancing observational tasks such as visual examination and granting simultaneous access to data and remote experts. Second, AR is anticipated to supplement distance learning of both minor and major procedures and nonprocedural skills such as cue recognition and empathy for patients and trainees. AR may also supplement long-distance education programs and thereby support less specialized medical facilities. However, the addition of AR may exacerbate the preexisting financial, structural, and literacy barriers to telemedicine. Providers seek value demonstrated by extensive research on the clinical outcome, satisfaction, and financial benefits of AR. They also seek institutional support and early training before adopting novel tools such as AR. Although an overall mixed reception is anticipated, consumer adoption and awareness are key components in AR's adoption.CONCLUSIONS: AR has the potential to enhance the ability to gather observational and medical information, which would serve a diverse set of applications in remote health care delivery and education. However, AR faces obstacles similar to those faced by the current telemedicine technology, such as lack of access, infrastructure, and familiarity. This paper discusses the potential areas of investigation that would inform future studies and approaches to implementing AR in telemedicine.}

 abstract     = {During the past decade, falling has been one of the top three causes of death amongst firefighters in China. Even though there are many studies on fall-detection systems (FDSs), the majority use a single motion sensor. Furthermore, few existing studies have considered the impact sensor placement and positioning have on fall-detection performance; most are targeted toward fall detection of the elderly. Unfortunately, floor cracks and unstable building structures in the fireground increase the difficulty of detecting the fall of a firefighter. In particular, the movement activities of firefighters are more varied; hence, distinguishing fall-like activities from actual falls is a significant challenge. This study proposed a smart wearable FDS for firefighter fall detection by integrating motion sensors into the firefighter's personal protective clothing on the chest, elbows, wrists, thighs, and ankles. The firefighter's fall activities are detected by the proposed multisensory recurrent neural network, and the performances of different combinations of inertial measurement units (IMUs) on different body parts were also investigated. The results indicated that the sensor fusion of IMUs from all five proposed body parts achieved performances of 94.10{\%}, 92.25{\%}, and 94.59{\%} in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively.}

Augmenting the information flow from an EMS vehicle to a receiving hospital may reduce information loss and improve patient outcomes. Such augmentation requires a noninvasive system that can automatically recognize clinical procedures being performed and send near real-time information to a receiving hospital. An automatic clinical procedure detection system that uses wearable sensors, video, and machine-learning to recognize clinical procedures within a controlled environment is presented.

One constructive criticism of the telemedicine initiative has been to question what positive benefits are gained from videoconferencing, paperless transactions, and online access to patient record. With a goal of producing a positive answer to such questions an architecture for multipurpose mobile telemedicine applications has been developed. The core technology is based upon a wearable personal computer with a smart-card interface coupled with speech, pen, video input and wireless intranet connectivity. The TransPAC system with the MedLink software system is designed to provide an integrated solution for a broad range of health care functions where mobile and hands-free or limited-access systems are preferred or necessary and where the capabilities of other mobile devices are insufficient or inappropriate. Structured and noise-resistant speech-to-text interfacing plus the use of a web browser-like display, accessible through either a flatpanel, standard, or headset monitor, gives the beltpack TransPAC computer the functions of a complete desktop including PCMCIA card interfaces for internet connectivity and a secure smartcard with 16-bit microprocessor and upwards of 64K memory. The card acts to provide user access control for security, user custom configuration of applications and display and vocabulary, and memory to diminish the need for PC-server communications while in an active session.

A fire reconnaissance robot was therefore developed to assist in the problem by offering important fire information to fire fighters. The robot consists of three main systems, a display operating system, video surveillance, and mapping and positioning navigation. Augmented reality (AR) goggle technology with a display operating system was also developed to free fire fighters' hands, which enables them to focus on rescuing processes and not system operation. Considering smoke disturbance, a thermal imaging video surveillance system was included to extract information from the complicated fire conditions. Meanwhile, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology was adopted to build the map, together with the help of a mapping and positioning navigation system. This can provide a real-time map under the rapidly changing fire conditions to guide the fire fighters to the fire sources or the trapped occupants. Based on our experiments, it was found that all the tested system components work quite well under the fire conditions, while the video surveillance system produces clear images under dense smoke and a high-temperature environment; SLAM shows a high accuracy with an average error of less than 3.43{\%}; the positioning accuracy error is 0.31 m; and the maximum error for the navigation system is 3.48{\%}. The developed fire reconnaissance robot can provide a practically important platform to improve fire rescue efficiency to reduce the fire casualties of fire fighters.}

We explored the use and potential value of an asynchronous, near-real time protocol-which avoids transmission issues associated with real-time applications-for recording, uploading, and viewing of high-definition (HD) visual media in the emergency department (ED) to facilitate remote surgical consults. Study Design First-responder physician assistants captured pertinent aspects of the physical examination and diagnostic imaging using Google Glass' HD video or high-resolution photographs. This visual media were then securely uploaded to the study website. The surgical consultation then proceeded over the phone in the usual fashion and a clinical decision was made. The surgeon then accessed the study website to review the uploaded video. This was followed by a questionnaire regarding how the additional data impacted the consultation. Results The management plan changed in 24{\%} (11) of cases after surgeons viewed the video. Five of these plans involved decision making regarding operative intervention. Although surgeons were generally confident in their initial management plan, confidence scores increased further in 44{\%} (20) of cases. In addition, we surveyed 276 ED patients on their opinions regarding concerning the practice of health care providers wearing and using recording devices in the ED. The survey results revealed that the majority of patients are amenable to the addition of wearable technology with video functionality to their care. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential value of a medically dedicated, hands-free, HD recording device with internet connectivity in facilitating remote surgical consultation.}

 abstract     = {Wearable haptic technologies have garnered recent widespread attention due to increased accessibility, functionality, and affordability. These systems typically provide haptic feedback to augment the human ability to interact with their environment. This study compares two haptic feedback modalities, vibrotactile and EMS, against visual feedback to elicit a motor response during active hand movement. Forty-five participants, divided into three groups, performed a task to touch their face and received one of three possible sensory feedback cues, namely visual, vibrotactile, and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), to interrupt their movement and avoid touching their face. Two quantitative performance measures are used in the comparison, the response time (time elapsed from stimulation to motor response) and the error rate (percentage that the user fails to avoid touching their face). Results showed that vibrotactile and EMS feedback yielded significantly faster response time than visual feedback, while no significant differences between vibrotactile and EMS were observed. Furthermore, the error rate was significantly lower for EMS compared to visual feedback, whereas no significant differences were observed between vibrotactile and visual feedback. In conclusion, it seems that EMS feedback is preferable for applications where errors are not tolerable (critical medical applications), whereas vibrotactile is superior for non-critical applications due to its low cost and higher usability (more pleasant compared to EMS).}

As a wearable device, HPPE significantly affects firefighters' occupational safety and health along with job performance. This study aims to explore the influential factors of HPPE comfort and collect corresponding functional requirements. A semi-structured interview was conducted among five focus groups comprising 31 Chinese firefighters. Through a qualitative analysis of the interview results, eight dimensions of HPPE comfort were proposed: perceived change, movement, attachment, harm, emotion, anxiety, thermal comfort and comfort of vision and hearing. The aspects of weight and size matching are the important reasons behind the comfort problems of the current HPPE. Four aspects of functional requirements were summarized: communication tools, goggles, full-face helmets and lighting. The study findings will provide references for improving HPPE design.}

In a fire in complex buildings, the importance of the collaboration between firefighters is clear. The increased demand on firefighter training for such environment is now evident. Due to cost, time, and safety issues, it is impossible to experience a real fire in such environments for training. In addition, the use of real fire for training does not enable repeatable training and the evaluation of the training is difficult. We developed a team-based firefighter training simulator for complex buildings using the virtual reality technology. It provides the training and evaluation of firefighting and mission-based team training. To model real fire phenomena in virtual space, a numerical analysis method based on fire dynamics is used. To achieve an immersive virtual environment, an augmented reality technique for the compensation of real world image and a haptic technique for heat experience are adopted. The developed training simulator can help the firefighter to respond to large and complex firefighting scenarios, while maintaining the safety of the trainees}

The proposed model has the function of collecting the information necessary for the first aid simply through the IT equipment based on the reality of reality, and also receiving the first aid method appropriate for the emergency situation to the medical staff and supporting the service. In addition, the proposed model hierarchically collects information related to emergency patient information inquiry, emergency patient status and emergency treatment based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The collected information uses a pair of comparison matrices to compensate for the ambiguity between the information. In particular, the collected information is stored in the server of the medical staff, and in addition to the unique information of the collected information, the collected information can be reflected in the medical service of the medical staff.}

 abstract     = {Faced with increasing demand for their services, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agencies must find more efficient ways to use their limited resources. This includes moving beyond the traditional response and transport model. Alternative Response Units (ARUs) are one way to meet the prehospital medical needs of some members of the public while reducing ambulance transports. They are non-transport vehicles tasked with very specific medical missions. These can include acute management of low-acuity complaints, ongoing home care for chronic medical conditions, preventive medicine, and post-hospital discharge follow-up visits. Their focus can be tailored to the individual needs of the agency. The Philadelphia Fire Department (PFD) operates one of the busiest EMS systems in the country. It has added additional staff and ambulances in recent years yet continues to face an increasing call volume. In an effort to reduce ambulance transports, the PFD recently introduced two ARUs. The first unit, AR-1, is deployed on a university campus and responds to students with low acuity medical complaints or mild alcohol intoxication. It provides many of these a courtesy ride to one of two university emergency departments for further evaluation, eliminating the need for ambulance transport. The second unit, AR-2, works in an area heavily impacted by the opioid crisis. It responds to individuals who have overdosed, been revived with naloxone, and refuse ambulance transport but are interested in long-term treatment for their opioid use disorder. The staff of AR-2 has successfully placed some of these individuals in treatment programs the same day. The AR-1 program is financially supported by the university while AR-2 is funded by the PFD and a federal grant. Both have the potential to decrease ambulance transports or reduce 9-1-1 calls. Whether these or other ARU programs can be financially sustained long-term is unclear. It is also unknown if ARUs represent a better investment than using the money to purchase additional transport vehicles. However, as health care evolves, EMS must innovate and adapt so it can continue to meet the prehospital needs of the public in a timely and cost-effective manner.}

Psychophysiological data may be important complementary indices for investigating variability in treatment response and changes over the course of treatment. The focus of the present investigation was to examine change in psychophysiological indices pre- to post-treatment and to investigate if changes differed for high versus low PTSD treatment responders. Participants included veterans with primary PTSD diagnoses who received a two-week intensive prolonged exposure (PE) treatment. Psychophysiological assessment included trauma-potentiated startle, heart rate, and skin conductance recordings during presentation of three standard virtual reality (VR)-based, trauma-relevant scenes presented through a head mounted display. Results indicate that 48.6{\%} were classified as high treatment responders (≥50{\%} reduction in PCL-5 from baseline). Trauma-potentiated startle was observed in all patients at pre-treatment, F = 13.58, p < .001, in that startle magnitude was increased during VR stimuli relative to baseline regardless of responder status. However, in high treatment responders, there was an interaction of VR with time, F = 14.10, p = .001; VR scenes did not potentiate startle post-treatment. Specifically, high treatment responders were less reactive to trauma stimuli following PE treatment. There was no effect of time in the low responder group. Heart rate reactivity data revealed a significant main effect of treatment, F = 45.7, p = .035, but no significant interaction with responder status. Skin conductance reactivity did not significantly change from pre to post-treatment. These results suggest that trauma-potentiated startle may represent an objective marker of fear- and anxiety-related symptom reduction that is sensitive to both traditional outpatient as well as intensive treatment approaches.}

One such innovation is the application of real-time monitoring, which comprises a smartwatch application and ecosystem, designed to collect, process and transmit a wide range of physiological, biomechanical, bioenergetic and environmental data using cloud-based services. We plan to assess the impact of this wireless technology during Tokyo 2020, where this technology could help characterize the physiological and thermal strain experienced by an athlete, as well as determine future management of athletes during a medical emergency as a result of a more timely and accurate diagnosis. Here we describe some of the innovative technologies developed for numerous sports at Tokyo 2020 ranging from race walking (20 km and 50 km events), marathon, triathlon, road cycling (including the time trial event), mountain biking, to potentially team sports played outdoors. A more symbiotic relationship between sport, health and technology needs to be encouraged that harnesses the unique demands of elite sport (e.g., the need for unobtrusive devices that provide real-time feedback) and serves as medical and preventive support for the athlete's care. The implementation of such applications would be particularly welcome in the field of medicine (i.e., telemedicine applications) and the workplace (with particular relevance to emergency services, the military and generally workers under extreme environmental conditions). Laboratory and field-based studies are required in simulated scenarios to validate such emerging technologies, with the field of sport serving as an excellent model to understand and impact disease.}

A questionnaire was used to rank these types of events according to stress and fatigue and a measure of association was applied to compare this ranking to the ECG features. Results indicate associations between this ranking and both heart rate and heart rate variability features extracted in the time domain.

Mobile phones, smart watches, and wearable activity trackers (WATs) are just some of the technologies that are guiding, nudging, monitoring, and reminding individuals in their day-to-day lives. These devices are designed to enhance and support their human users, however, there is a lack of attention to the unintended consequences, the technology non-neutrality and the darker sides of becoming human-tech hybrids. Using the extended mind theory (EMT) and agential intra-action, we aimed at exploring how human-tech hybrids gain collective skills and how these are put to use; how agency is expressed and how this affects the interactions; and what the darker sides are of being a human-tech hybrid. Using a qualitative method, we analyzed the experiences of using a WAT, with a specific focus on how the tracker and the individual solve tasks, share competences, develop new skills, and negotiate for agency and autonomy. We contributed with new insight on human-tech hybridity and presented a concept referred to as the agency pendulum, reflecting the dynamism of agency. Finally, we demonstrated how the EMT and agential intra-action as a combined theoretical lens can be used to explore human-tech hybridity.}

 abstract     = {The concept of ubiquitous healthcare service, which emerged as one of measures to solve healthcare problems in aged society, means that patients can receive services such as prevention, diagnosis, therapy and prognosis management at any time and in any place with the help of advanced information and communication technology. This service requires not only biomedical digital assistant that can monitor continuously the patients' health condition regardless of time and place, but also wired and wireless communication devices and telemedicine servers that provide doctors with data on patients' present health condition. In order to implement a biomedical digital assistant that is portable and wearable to patients, the present study developed a device that minimizes size, weight and power consumption, measures ECG and PPG signals, and even monitors moving patients' state. The biomedical sensor with the function of wireless communication was designed to be highly portable and wearable, to be operable 24 hours with small-size batteries, and to monitor the subject's heart rate, step count and respiratory rate in his daily life. The biomedical signal receiving device was implemented in two forms, PDA and cellular phone. The movement monitoring device embedded in the battery pack of a cellular phone does not have any problem in operating 24 hours, but the real-time biomedical signal receiving device implemented with PDA operated up to 6 hours due to the limited battery capacity of PDA. This problem is expected to be solved by reducing wireless communication load through improving the processing and storage functions of the sensor. The developed device can transmit a message on the patient's emergency to the remote server through the cellular phone network, and is expected to play crucial roles in the health management of chronic-aged patients in their daily life.}

 abstract     = {Major natural disasters have occurred frequently in the last few years, resulting in increased loss of life and economic damage. Most emergency responders do not have first-hand experience with major natural disasters, and thus, there is an urgent need for pre-disaster training. Due to the scenes unreality of traditional emergency drills, the failure to appeal to the target audience and the novel coronavirus pandemic, people are forced to maintain safe social distancing. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out transregional or transnational emergency drills in many countries under the lockdown. There is an increasing demand for simulation training systems that use virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality visualization technologies to simulate major natural disasters. The simulation training system related to natural disasters provides a new way for popular emergency avoidance science education and emergency rescue personnel to master work responsibilities and improve emergency response capabilities. However, to our knowledge, there is no overview of the simulation training system for major natural disasters. Hence, this paper uncovers the visualization techniques commonly used in simulation training systems, and compares, analyses and summarizes the architecture and functions of the existing simulation training systems for different emergency phases of common natural disasters. In addition, the limitations of the existing simulation training system in practical applications and future development directions are discussed to provide reference for relevant researchers to better understand the modern simulation training system.}

This workflow, however, has proven labor intensive, time consuming, and prone to human error [1]. In collaboration with three EMS groups in the Washington, DC Metropolitan area, we have developed a next generation triage system to improve the effectiveness of emergency response. This system includes: 1) electronic triage tags, 2) wearable vital sign sensors, 3) base stations laptops to monitor and manage patients, 4) pervasive tracking software to locate patients at all stages of the disaster response process, and 5) PDAs to support documentation and communication. Our system has evolved through three iterations of rapid-development, field-studies, usability reviews, and focus-group interview. This paper summarizes engineering considerations for technologies that must operate under constraints of medical emergencies. It is our hope that the lessons reported in this paper will help technologists in developing future emergency response systems.}

Regional tissue oxygenation (rO2) can be assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), but clinical NIRS monitors are unpractical ("big boxes" and additional cables) in HEMS. As an alternative, we identified a wearable, athlete training NIRS device (Moxy; Idiag, Fehraltorf, Switzerland) and hypothesized that it would be applicable in our HEMS setting.METHODS: This feasibility study was performed at the Dutch HEMS Lifeliner 1. The Moxy sensor was tested in-flight and on ground. We tested various anatomic measurement spots, and multiple conditions and interventions were imposed to track rO2.RESULTS: The rO2 measurements with the wearable Moxy NIRS device are both feasible and practical in an HEMS setting. Multiple conditions and interventions were tested successfully (eg, tourniquet placement [rO2], muscle compression [rO2], reperfusion [rO2], oxygen administration [rO2], hyperemia [rO2], and venous congestion [rO2]).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that rO2 measurements with the wearable Moxy NIRS device are both feasible and practical in HEMS, and Moxy allows the tracking of simulated pathophysiologic effects on rO2. Future studies will have to verify our preliminary data and elucidate if and how wearable NIRS monitoring may support treatment in HEMS and improve patient outcome.}

This Georgia Tech Wearable Motherboard (GTWM) provides an extremely versatile framework for the incorporation of sensing, monitoring and information processing devices. The principal advantage of GTWM is that it provides, for the first time, a very systematic way of monitoring the vital signs of humans in an unobtrusive manner. Appropriate sensors have been "plugged" into this motherboard using the developed Interconnection Technology and attached to any part of the individual being monitored, thereby creating a flexible wearable monitoring device. The flexible data bus integrated into the structure transmits the information to monitoring devices such as an EKG Machine, a temperature recorder, a voice recorder, etc. The bus also serves to transmit information to the sensors (and hence, the wearer) from external sources, thus making GTWM a valuable information infrastructure. GTWM is lightweight and can be worn easily by anyone--from infants to senior citizens. GTWM has enormous potential for applications in fields such as telemedicine, monitoring of patients in post-operative recovery, the prevention of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), and monitoring of astronauts, athletes, law enforcement personnel and combat soldiers.}

The usability issues and human factors entailed in these new technologies are important to their application and effectiveness, suggesting the need to examine this information in a systematic review. The systematic review aims to synthesize the user-centered evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies. We conducted a systematic literature search in four databases (Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science) for articles published between the years 2000 and 2019. We included articles that evaluated the technologies developed for supporting prehospital communication and collaboration, and were published in English. A total of 918 articles were retrieved and screened, with 17 articles included for in-depth analysis. Two authors conducted independent screens and reviews of the articles using a list of inclusion/exclusion criteria and defined factors. The types of technology of reviewed articles included ambulance-based telemedicine, wearable, handheld, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Even though these technologies have demonstrated high levels of user acceptance, the reviewed studies noted a variety of challenges faced by emergency care providers, which were grouped into three categories-technical, usability, and organizational challenges. Our review also highlighted the paucity of evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies and the lack of user engagement throughout system design process. Based on the results, we discuss the importance of adopting user-centered design approaches and accounting for three social-technical factors in designing technologies for time-critical medical settings, including cognitive and physical stressor, workflow, and context. This systematic review presents an overview of key evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies. The paucity of evaluative research in prehospital communication technology and challenges faced in adopting advanced technological solutions in emergency care highlight the need to adopt user-centered design and take into account socio-technical issues at the point of system design.}

An augmented reality (AR)-based indoor positioning monitoring system can display locations of rescuer inside the building that can be seen by commanders to help intuitive recognition of positioning. To monitor AR-based indoor positioning, it is necessary to have an estimation technique of line of sight vector of observers. In the present study, an estimation technique of a line of sight vector using ultra-wide band tranceiver installed inside the indoor to trace locations is presented.}

A high degree of correlation was noted for most of the measured variables [HR (r = 0.99), RR (r = 0.98), T(sk) (r = 0.98), V(E) (r = 0.88), and SaO(2) (r = 0.79)]. V(T) (r = 0.60) had a moderate correlation, although a paired differences analysis showed a mean paired difference of -0.03 L. This mean paired difference represents a 1.92{\%} variation for V(T). Data from the wearable sensor vest is comparable to data captured from standard laboratory physiological monitoring equipment on subjects wearing standard firefighter ensembles while exercising at a moderate work rate. This study demonstrates the accuracy of the wearable sensor technology for these physiological parameters under these conditions and suggests that it could be useful for actual field studies of firefighters in traditional firefighting gear.}

High-quality pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is generally challenging for community hospital teams, where pediatric cardiac arrest is infrequent. Current feedback systems are insufficient. Therefore, we developed an augmented reality (AR) CPR feedback system for use in many settings.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether AR-CPR improves chest compression (CC) performance in non-pediatric-specialized community emergency departments (EDs).METHODS: We performed an unblinded, randomized, crossover simulation-based study. A convenience sample of community ED nonpediatric nurses and technicians were included. Each participant performed three 2-min cycles of CC during a simulated pediatric cardiac arrest. Participants were randomized to use AR-CPR in one of three CC cycles. Afterward, participants participated in a qualitative interview to inquire about their experience with AR-CPR.RESULTS: Of 36 participants, 18 were randomized to AR-CPR in cycle 2 (group A) and 18 were randomized to AR-CPR in cycle 3 (group B). When using AR-CPR, 87-90{\%} (SD 12-13{\%}) of all CCs were in goal range, analyzed as 1-min intervals, compared with 18-21{\%} (SD 30-33{\%}) without feedback (p < 0.001). Analysis of qualitative themes revealed that AR-CPR may be usable without a device orientation, be effective at cognitive offloading, and reduce anxiety around and enhance confidence in the CC delivered.CONCLUSIONS: The novel CPR feedback system, AR-CPR, significantly changed the CC performance in community hospital non-pediatric-specialized general EDs from 18-21{\%} to 87-90{\%} of CC epochs at goal. This study offers preliminary evidence suggesting AR-CPR improves CC quality in community hospital settings.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Stress at work has been broadly acknowledged as a worldwide problem and has been the focus of concern for many researchers. Firefighting, in particular, is frequently reported as a highly stressful occupation. In order to investigate firefighters' occupational health in terms of stress events, perceptions, symptoms, and physiological reactions under real-world conditions, an ambulatory assessment protocol was developed.METHODS: Seventeen firefighters' cardiac signal was continuously monitored during an average of three shifts within a working week with medical clinically certified equipment (VitalJacket), which allows for continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) and actigraphy measurement. Psychological data were collected with a software application running on smartphones, collecting potential stressful events, stress symptoms, and stress appraisal.RESULTS: A total of 450.56 h of medical-quality ECG were collected, and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed. Findings suggest that although 'fire' situations are more common, 'accidents' are more stressful. Additionally, firefighters showed high levels of physiological stress (based on AVNN and LF/HF HRV metrics) when compared to normative healthy population values that may not be diagnosed using merely self-reports.DISCUSSION: The proposed ambulatory study seems to be useful for the monitoring of stress levels and its potential impact on health of first responders. Additionally, it could also be an important tool for the design and implementation of efficient interventions and informed management resolutions in real time. Potential applications of this research include the development of quantified occupational health (qOHealth) devices for real life monitoring of emergency personnel stress reactions.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals face high physical demands in high-stress settings; however, the prevalence of cardiovascular health (CVH) risk factors in this health care workforce has not been explored. The primary objective of this study was to compare the distribution of CVH and its individual components between a sample of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. The secondary objective was to identify associations between demographic and employment characteristics with ideal CVH in EMS professionals.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey based on the American Heart Association's (AHA; Dallas, Texas USA) Life's Simple 7 (LS7) was administered to nationally-certified EMTs and paramedics. The LS7 components were scored according to previously described cut points (ideal = 2; intermediate = 1; poor = 0). A composite CVH score (0-10) was calculated from the component scores, excluding cholesterol and blood glucose due to missing data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR; 95{\%} CI) for demographic and employment characteristics associated with optimal CVH (≥7 points).RESULTS: There were 24,708 respondents that were currently practicing and included. More EMTs achieved optimal CVH (n = 4,889; 48.8{\%}) compared to paramedics (n = 4,338; 40.6{\%}). Factors associated with higher odds of optimal CVH included: higher education level (eg, college graduate or more: OR = 2.26; 95{\%} CI, 1.97-2.59); higher personal income (OR = 1.26; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-1.37); and working in an urban versus rural area (OR = 1.31; 95{\%} CI, 1.23-1.40). Paramedic certification level (OR = 0.84; 95{\%} CI, 0.78-0.91), older age (eg, 50 years or older: OR = 0.65; 95{\%} CI, 0.58-0.73), male sex (OR = 0.54; 95{\%} CI, 0.50-0.56), working for a non-fire-based agency (eg, private service: OR = 0.68; 95{\%} CI, 0.62-0.74), and providing medical transport service (OR = 0.81; 95{\%} CI, 0.69-0.94) were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH.CONCLUSIONS: Several EMS-related characteristics were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH. Future studies should focus on better understanding the CVH and metabolic risk profiles for EMS professionals and their association with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), major cardiac events, and occupational mortality.Cash RE, Crowe RP, Bower JK, Foraker RE, Panchal AR.

The practice of medicine in disaster and conflict is a profession practiced in environments where lack of resources, chaos, and unpredictability are the norm rather than the exception. With this consideration in mind, the World Health Organization (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) and its partners set out to improve the disaster response systems. The resulting Emergency Medical Team (EMT) classification system requires that teams planning on engaging in disaster response follow common standards for the delivery of care in resource-constraint environments. In order to clarify these standards, the WHO EMT Secretariat collaborated with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC; Geneva, Switzerland) and leading experts from other stakeholder non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to produce a guide to the management of limb injuries in disaster and conflict.The resulting text is a free and open-access resource to provide guidance for national and international EMTs caring for patients in disasters and conflicts. The content is a result of expert consensus, literature review, and an iterative process designed to encourage debate and resolution of existing open questions within the field of disaster and conflict medical response.The end result of this process is a text providing guidance to providers seeking to deliver safe, effective care within the EMT framework that is now part of the EMT training and verification system and is being distributed to ICRC teams deploying to the field.This work seeks to encourage professionalization of the field of disaster and conflict response, and to contribute to the existing EMT framework, in order to provide for better care for future victims of disaster and conflict.Jensen G, Bar-On E, Wiedler JT, Hautz SC, Veen H, Kay AR, Norton I, Gosselin RA, von Schreeb J.

The various links in the chain of survival are affected differently. Bystander assistance or bystander CPR is available in only 30{\%} of the emergencies, response intervals--if at all required by legislation--are observed to only a limited degree or are too extended for survival in cardiac arrest. A single emergency telephone number is lacking. Too many different phone numbers for emergency reporting result in confusion and delays. Organizational realities are not fully overcome and impair efficiency. The position of the emergency physician in the EMS System is inadequately defined, the qualification of too many emergency physicians are unsatisfactory. In spite of this, emergency physicians are frequently forced to answer out-of-hospital emergency calls. Conflicts between emergency physicians and EMTs may be overcome by providing both groups with comparable qualifications as well as by providing an explicit definition of emergency competence. A further source of conflict occurs at the juncture of prehospital and inhospital emergency care in the emergency department. Deficiencies on either side play a decisive role. At least in principle there are solutions to the deficiencies in the EMSS and in intensive care medicine. They are among others: Adequate financial compensation of emergency personnel, availability of sufficient numbers of highly qualified personnel, availability of a central receiving area with an adjacent emergency ward, constant information flow to the dispatch center on the number of available emergency beds, maintaining 5{\%} of all beds as emergency beds, establishing intermediate care facilities. Efficiency of emergency physician activities can be demonstrated in polytraumatized patients or in patients with ventricular fibrillation or acute myocardial infarction, in patients with acute myocardial insufficiency and other emergency clinical pictures. Cost effectiveness is clearly in favor of emergency medicine. Future developments will be characterized by the consequences of new health care legislation and by effects of financial stringencies on the emergency medical services.}

Hypothesis/Problem The objective of this study was to describe a pilot program evaluating alternative staffing on two ambulances utilizing the paramedic-basic (PB) model (staffed with one paramedic and one emergency medical technician[EMT]).METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted from September 17, 2013 through December 31, 2013. The PB ambulances were compared to geographically matched ambulances staffed with paramedic-paramedic (PP ambulances). One PP and one PB ambulance were based at Station A; one PP and one PB ambulance were based at Station B. The primary outcome was total on-scene time. Secondary outcomes included time-to-electrocardiogram (EKG), time-to-intravenous (IV) line insertion, IV-line success rate, and percentage of protocol violations. Inclusion criteria were all patients requesting prehospital services that were attended to by these teams. Patients were excluded if they were not attended to by the study ambulance vehicles. Descriptive statistics were reported as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Proportions were reported with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI). The Mann-Whitley U test was used for significance testing (P<.05).RESULTS: Median on-scene times at Station A for the PP ambulance were shorter than the PB ambulance team (PP: 10.1 minutes, IQR 6.0-15; PB: 13.0 minutes, IQR 8.1-18; P=.01). This finding also was noted at Station B (PP: 13.5 minutes, IQR 8.5-19; PB: 14.3 minutes, IQR 9.9-20; P=.01). There were no differences between PP and PB ambulance teams at Station A or Station B in time-to-EKG, time-to-IV insertion, IV success rate, and protocol violation rates.CONCLUSION: In the setting of a well-developed EMS system utilizing an all-Advanced Life Support (ALS) response, this study suggests that PB ambulance teams may function well when compared to PP ambulances. Though longer scene times were observed, differences in time to ALS interventions and protocol violation rates were not different. Hybrid ambulance teams may be an effective staffing alternative, but decisions to use this model must address clinical and operational concerns. Cortez EJ , Panchal AR , Davis JE , Keseg DP .

However, because of the lack of effective methods, the damage resulting of repeated and unrelenting disaster has not been reduced. With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, more effective ways to prevent and respond to disasters in humans have been found. Meanwhile, ICT has been applied as the combined disaster prevention response technology. A typical example is the virtual reality/extended reality system, regarded as the core part of this research, which is widely applied in other fields. Especially in the fire training field, the application of virtual reality system is very meaningful. This paper examines the current status of VR/XR and its effectiveness, by analyzing the case of fire training system introduction. The purpose of this paper is that firefighters can respond efficiently at various disaster sites by spreading and application of VR/XR-based disaster training system with domestic technology.}

Although police forces are under increasing pressure to improve efficiency and productivity, the evaluation of well-being in law enforcement is mostly restricted to self-report stress questionnaires that are based on questionable construction methodologies. No instrument to specifically determine the well-being of police force employees currently exists.AIMS: To construct an instrument that measures the work-related well-being of officers and staff within a police force.METHODS: The approach is drawn from well-established clinical models used to evaluate the well-being of patients. Potential variables were confirmed using an item selection method known as impact analysis that places keen emphasis on frequency and importance as perceived by the respondents themselves.RESULTS: Analyses of 822 completed response sets showed that nine separate dimensions of police work can adversely affect well-being (advancement, facilities, home work interface, job, physical health, psychological health, relationships, organizational and workload). Overall, officers showed inferior well-being compared with their colleagues. Content validity and adequate internal reliability were confirmed.CONCLUSIONS: This study considered a new robust approach to evaluating the well-being of all those working in law enforcement. The nine dimensions extended beyond conventional stress measures and may offer a practical alternative way of assessing the overall well-being status of an entire force using a systematic item selection framework.}

What distinguishes it from a pure computer simulation game is that it can interface with external mass casualty incident management systems, such as DIORAMA. The game will enable system developers to specify technical requirements of underlying technology, and test different alternatives of design. After the information system hardware and software are completed, the game can simulate various algorithms such as localization technologies, and interface with an actual user interface on PCs and Smartphones.

The age, weight, height, body fat, and VO(2max) of the firefighters were recorded before the trial, and percentage of heart rate reserve ({\%}HRR) was recorded during the stair climbing. Nonlinear modeling of HRR time series and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the data to isolate a small number of variables that quantify overall individual physical fitness. The HRR was represented as a function of time using the sum of linear and trigonometric functions. Four main factors that influence performance, obtained from PCA analysis, emerged (78.2{\%} of total explained variance): the capacity to carry the extra load (22.8{\%} of total variance); the effect of body fat (19.6{\%} of total variance); the influence of age in the task (19.3{\%} of total variance); and the overall fitness level (16.4{\%} of total variance). This approach allowed us to make a rapid assessment of each subject's fitness level. Such an assessment could be used in planning individualized functional training programs to improve each firefighter's job performance and reduce injuries and hence save time, energy, and financial resources.}

These teams provide 24/7 readiness, yet some parents still call the general emergency medical service (EMS) for various reasons. EMS is exposed to complex medical problems in rare diseases. Questions arose about the experiences of EMS and whether they felt prepared for emergencies involving children treated by a palliative care team.Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach to focus on the interface between palliative care and EMS. First, open interviews were conducted, and a questionnaire was developed based on the results. The variables included demographic items and individual experiences with patients. Second, a case report of a child with respiratory insufficiency was presented to assess the spontaneous treatment intentions of EMS providers. Finally, the need, relevant topics, and duration of specific training in palliative care for EMS providers were evaluated.Results: In total, 1,005 EMS providers responded to the questionnaire. The average age was 34.5 years ({\textpm}10.94SD), 74.6{\%} were male. The average work experience was 11.8 years ({\textpm}9.7), 21.4{\%} were medical doctors. Experience with a call of a life-threatening emergency involving a child was reported by 61.5{\%} and severe psychological distress during such a call was reported by 60.4{\%}. The equivalent distress frequency for adult patient calls was 38.3{\%}. (p<0.001). After review of the case report, the EMS respondents suggested invasive treatment options and rapid transport to the hospital. Most (93.7{\%}) respondents welcomed the consideration of special training in pediatric palliative care. This training should include basic information about palliative care, an analysis of cases involving palliatively treated children, an ethical perspective, practical recommendations, and available (24/7) local contact for further guidance and support.Conclusion: Emergencies in pediatric palliatively treated patients were more common than expected. EMS providers perceived the situations as stressful, and there is a need for specific training with practical aspects.}

 abstract     = {The UK Defence Medical Service's Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) capability includes rapid-deployment Medical Emergency Response Teams (MERTs) comprising tri-service trauma consultants, paramedics and specialised nurses, all of whom are qualified to administer emergency care under extreme conditions to improve the survival prospects of combat casualties. The pre-deployment training of MERT personnel is designed to foster individual knowledge, skills and abilities in PHEC and in small team performance and cohesion in 'mission-specific' contexts. Until now, the provision of airborne pre-deployment MERT training had been dependent on either the availability of an operational aircraft (eg, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter) or access to one of only two ground-based facsimiles of the Chinook's rear cargo/passenger cabin. Although MERT training has high priority, there will always be competition with other military taskings for access to helicopter assets (and for other platforms in other branches of the Armed Forces). This paper describes the development of an inexpensive, reconfigurable and transportable MERT training concept based on 'mixed reality' technologies-in effect the 'blending' of real-world objects of training relevance with virtual reality reconstructions of operational contexts.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Solitary death (kodokushi) has recently become recognized as a social issue in Japan. The social isolation of older people leads to death without dignity. With the outbreak of COVID-19, efforts to eliminate solitary death need to be adjusted in line with changes in lifestyle and accompanying changes in social structure. Health monitoring services that utilize wearable devices may contribute to this end. Our goals are to outline how wearable devices might be used to (1) detect emergency situations involving solitary older people and swiftly connect them with medical treatment, to (2) reduce the frequency of deaths that remain undiscovered and (3) to reduce social isolation by promoting social interaction.METHODS: Theoretical and philosophical approaches were adopted to examine ethical issues surrounding the application of wearable devices and cloud-based information processing systems to prevent solitary death in the world with/after COVID-19. MAIN BODY: (1) Technology cannot replace social connections; without social support necessary to foster understanding of the benefits of health management through wearable devices among older adults, such devices may remain unused, or not used properly. (2) Maturity of the technology; systems face the difficult task of detecting and responding to a wide range of health conditions and life-threatening events in time to avert avoidable morbidity and mortality. (3) Autonomy and personhood; promoting the voluntary use of wearable devices that are a part of larger efforts to connect isolated individuals to a community or social services might be effective. Legal force should be avoided if possible. There is some concern that landlords may require an older person to sign a contract agreeing to wear a device. The autonomy of solitary older people should be respected. (4) Governance: policies must be developed to limit access to data from wearables and the purposes for which data can be used.CONCLUSION: If thoughtfully deployed under proper policy constraints, wearable devices offer a way to connect solitary older people to health services and could reduce cases of solitary death while respecting the personhood of the user.}

IoMT facilitates prompt emergency responses and provides improved quality of medical services with minimum cost. With the advancement of modern technology, progressively ubiquitous medical devices raise critical security and data privacy concerns through resource constraints and open connectivity. Vulnerabilities in IoMT devices allow unauthorized access for potential entry into healthcare and sensitive personal data. In addition, the patient may experience severe physical damage with the attack on IoMT devices. To provide security to IoMT devices and privacy to patient data, we have proposed a novel IoMT framework with the hybridization of Bayesian optimization and extreme learning machine (ELM). The proposed model derives encouraging performance with enhanced accuracy in decision-making process compared to similar state-of-the-art methods.}

 abstract     = {PURPOSE: In recent years, digital technology and wearable devices applied to seizure detection have progressively become available. In this study, we investigated the perspectives of people with epilepsy (PWE), caregivers (CG), and healthcare professionals (HP). We were interested in their current use of digital technology as well as their willingness to use wearables to monitor seizures. We also explored the role of factors influencing engagement with technology, including demographic and clinical characteristics, data confidentiality, need for technical support, and concerns about strain or increased workload.METHODS: An online survey drawing on previous data collected via focus groups was constructed and distributed via a web link. Using logistic regression analyses, demographic, clinical, and other factors identified to influence engagement with technology were correlated with reported use and willingness to use digital technology and wearables for seizure tracking.RESULTS: Eighty-seven surveys were completed, fifty-two (59.7{\%}) by PWE, 13 (14.4{\%}) by CG, and 22 (25.3{\%}) by HP. Responders were familiar with multiple digital technologies, including the Internet, smartphones, and personal computers, and the use of digital services was similar to the UK average. Moreover, age and disease-related factors did not influence access to digital technology. The majority of PWE were willing to use a wearable device for long-term seizure tracking. However, only a limited number of PWE reported current regular use of wearables, and nonusers attributed their choice to uncertainty about the usefulness of this technology in epilepsy care. People with epilepsy envisaged the possibility of understanding their condition better through wearables and considered, with caution, the option to send automatic emergency calls. Despite concerns around accuracy, data confidentiality, and technical support, these factors did not limit PWE's willingness to use digital technology. Caregivers appeared willing to provide support to PWE using wearables and perceived a reduction of their workload and anxiety. Healthcare professionals identified areas of application for digital technologies in their clinical practice, pending an appropriate reorganization of the clinical team to share the burden of data reviewing and handling.CONCLUSIONS: Unlike people who have other chronic health conditions, PWE appeared not to be at risk of digital exclusion. This study highlighted a great interest in the use of wearable technology across epilepsy service users, carers, and healthcare professionals, which was independent of demographic and clinical factors and outpaced data security and technology usability concerns.}

The services were provided for both patients and health professionals.METHODS: The pilot services were implemented to enhance healthcare service quality, improve patient safety, and provide an effective business process to health professionals in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. The services to enhance healthcare service quality include healing tours, cancer information/education, psychological assessments, indoor navigation, and exercise volume checking. The services to improve patient safety are monitoring of high-risk inpatients and delivery of real-time health information in emergency situations. In addition, the services to provide an effective business process to health professionals include surveys and web services for patient management.RESULTS: Considering the sustainability of the pilot services, we decided to pause navigation and patient monitoring services until the interference problem could be completely resolved because beacon signal interference significantly influences the quality of services. On the other hand, we had to continue to provide new wearable beacons to high-risk patients because of hygiene issues, so the cost increased over time and was much higher than expected.CONCLUSIONS: To make the smart connected hospital services sustainable, technical feasibility (e.g., beacon signal interference), economic feasibility (e.g., continuous provision of new necklace beacons), and organizational commitment and support (e.g., renewal of new alternative medical devices and infrastructure) are required.}

Utilizing the state-of-the-art information technologies (IT), various diagnostic medical instruments have been integrated into a personal wearable device and a home telehealthcare system. We developed a wrist-worn integrated health monitoring device (WIHMD) which performs the measurements of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oximetry (SpO2), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration rate, heart rate, and body surface temperature and the detection of falls to determine the onset of emergency situation. The WIHMD also analyzes the acquired bio-signals and transmits the resultant data to a healthcare service center through a commercial cellular phone. Two different kinds of IT-based blood glucometer have been developed using a cellular phone and PDA(personal digital assistant) as a main unit. A blood glucometer was also integrated within a wrist pressure measurement module which is interfaced with a cellular phone via Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) standard in order to provide users with easiness in measuring and handling two important health parameters. Non-intrusive bio-signal measurement systems were developed for the ease of home use. One can measure his ECG on a bed while he is sleeping; measure his ECG, body temperature, bodyfat ratio and weight on a toilet seat; measure his ECG on a chair; and estimate the degree of activity by motion analysis using a camera. Another integrated diagnostic system for home telehealthcare services has been developed to include a 12 channels ECG, a pressure meter for NIBP, a blood glucometer, a bodyfat meter and a spirometer. It is an expert system to analyze the measured health data and based on the diagnostic result, the system provides an appropriate medical consultation. The measured data can be either stored on the system or transmitted to the central server through the internet. We have installed the developed systems on a model house for the performance evaluation and confirmed the possibility of the system as an effective tool for the personalized healthcare services.}

AR, which has largely been explored for communication and collaboration in nonhealth contexts, could play a role in shaping future remote medical services and training. This review summarized existing studies implementing AR in real-time telemedicine and telementoring to create a foundation for health care providers and technology developers to understand future opportunities in remote care and education.OBJECTIVE: This review described devices and platforms that use AR for real-time telemedicine and telementoring, the tasks for which AR was implemented, and the ways in which these implementations were evaluated to identify gaps in research that provide opportunities for further study.METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and MEDLINE to identify English-language studies published between January 1, 2012, and October 18, 2022, implementing AR technology in a real-time interaction related to telemedicine or telementoring. The search terms were "augmented reality" OR "AR" AND "remote" OR "telemedicine" OR "telehealth" OR "telementoring." Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and discussion-based articles were excluded from analysis.RESULTS: A total of 39 articles met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into themes of patient evaluation, medical intervention, and education. In total, 20 devices and platforms using AR were identified, with common features being the ability for remote users to annotate, display graphics, and display their hands or tools in the local user's view. Common themes across the studies included consultation and procedural education, with surgery, emergency, and hospital medicine being the most represented specialties. Outcomes were most often measured using feedback surveys and interviews. The most common objective measures were time to task completion and performance. Long-term outcome and resource cost measurements were rare. Across the studies, user feedback was consistently positive for perceived efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability. Comparative trials demonstrated that AR-assisted conditions had noninferior reliability and performance and did not consistently extend procedure times compared with in-person controls.CONCLUSIONS: Studies implementing AR in telemedicine and telementoring demonstrated the technology's ability to enhance access to information and facilitate guidance in multiple health care settings. However, AR's role as an alternative to current telecommunication platforms or even in-person interactions remains to be validated, with many disciplines and provider-to-nonprovider uses still lacking robust investigation. Additional studies comparing existing methods may offer more insight into this intersection, but the early stage of technical development and the lack of standardized tools and adoption have hindered the conduct of larger longitudinal and randomized controlled trials. Overall, AR has the potential to complement and advance the capabilities of remote medical care and learning, creating unique opportunities for innovator, provider, and patient involvement.}

Emergency medicine residents (resident toxicology consultants) rotating on the toxicology service wore Glass during bedside evaluation of poisoned patients; Glass transmitted real-time video of patients' physical examination findings to toxicology fellows and attendings (supervisory consultants), who reviewed these findings. We evaluated the usability (e.g., quality of connectivity and video feeds) of Glass by supervisory consultants, as well as attitudes towards use of Glass. Resident toxicology consultants and supervisory consultants completed 18 consults through Glass. Toxicologists viewing the video stream found the quality of audio and visual transmission usable in 89 {\%} of cases. Toxicologists reported their management of the patient changed after viewing the patient through Glass in 56 {\%} of cases. Based on findings obtained through Glass, toxicologists recommended specific antidotes in six cases.

 abstract     = {Falls are a serious threat to the health of older people. A wearable fall detector can automatically detect the occurrence of a fall and alert a caregiver or an emergency response service so they may deliver immediate assistance, improving the chances of recovering from fall-related injuries. One constraint of such a wearable technology is its limited battery life. Thus, minimization of power consumption is an important design concern, all the while maintaining satisfactory accuracy of the fall detection algorithms implemented on the wearable device. This paper proposes an approach for selecting power-efficient signal features such that the minimum desirable fall detection accuracy is assured. Using data collected in simulated falls, simulated activities of daily living, and real free-living trials, all using young volunteers, the proposed approach selects four features from a set of ten commonly used features, providing a power saving of 75.3{\%}, while limiting the error rate of a binary classification decision tree fall detection algorithm to 7.1{\%}.Falls are a serious threat to the health of older people. A wearable fall detector can automatically detect the occurrence of a fall and alert a caregiver or an emergency response service so they may deliver immediate assistance, improving the chances of recovering from fall-related injuries. One constraint of such a wearable technology is its limited battery life. Thus, minimization of power consumption is an important design concern, all the while maintaining satisfactory accuracy of the fall detection algorithms implemented on the wearable device. This paper proposes an approach for selecting power-efficient signal features such that the minimum desirable fall detection accuracy is assured.

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: To treat many patients despite lacking personnel resources, triage is important in disaster medicine. Various triage algorithms help but often are used incorrectly or not at all. One potential problem-solving approach is to support triage with Smart Glasses.OBJECTIVE: In this study, augmented reality was used to display a triage algorithm and telemedicine assistance was enabled to compare the duration and quality of triage with a conventional one.METHODS: A specific Android app was designed for use with Smart Glasses, which added information in terms of augmented reality with two different methods-through the display of a triage algorithm in data glasses and a telemedical connection to a senior emergency physician realized by the integrated camera. A scenario was created (ie, randomized simulation study) in which 31 paramedics carried out a triage of 12 patients in 3 groups as follows: without technical support (control group), with a triage algorithm display, and with telemedical contact.RESULTS: A total of 362 assessments were performed. The accuracy in the control group was only 58{\%}, but the assessments were quicker (on average 16.6 seconds). In contrast, an accuracy of 92{\%} (P=.04) was achieved when using technical support by displaying the triage algorithm. This triaging took an average of 37.0 seconds. The triage group wearing data glasses and being telemedically connected achieved 90{\%} accuracy (P=.01) in 35.0 seconds.CONCLUSIONS: Triage with data glasses required markedly more time. While only a tally was recorded in the control group, Smart Glasses led to digital capture of the triage results, which have many tactical advantages. We expect a high potential in the application of Smart Glasses in disaster scenarios when using telemedicine and augmented reality features to improve the quality of triage.}

Fire fighters (smoke divers) which are exposed to both heat-stress and high-risk situations have been used as test case. PASI combines a modified version of the relatively well-known physiological strain index (PSI) with activity data from accelerometers. The algorithm has been developed based on tests in a laboratory, and it has been verified in two field tests performed by smoke divers exposed to heat stress. The verification demonstrates that it is possible to distinguish between high- and low-risk situations when data from accelerometers are added to the situation analysis. This indicates that PASI can contribute to an improved risk assessment and online decision support for smoke divers compared to using PSI alone.}

Studies were deemed relevant to the research question if they involved human subjects, used wearable technology that tracked a health-related parameter, and incorporated data from wearable technology into a predictive model of mortality, readmission, and/or emergency department (ED) visits.Results: Eight unique studies were directly related to the research question, and all were of at least moderate quality. Six studies developed models for readmission and two for mortality. In each of the eight studies, data obtained from wearable technology were predictive of or significantly associated with the tracked outcome.Discussion: Only eight unique studies incorporated wearable technology data into predictive models. The eight studies were of moderate quality or higher and thereby provide proof of concept for the use of wearable technology in developing models that predict clinical outcomes.Conclusion: Wearable technology has significant potential to assist in predicting clinical outcomes, but needs further study. Well-designed clinical trials that incorporate data from wearable technology into clinical outcome prediction models are required to realize the opportunities of this advancing technology.}

Also, work safety can be improved if stress is timely and reliably detected. The availability of low-cost consumer wearable devices that monitor vital-signs, gives access to stress detection schemes. Heart rate variability (HRV), a stress-related vital-sign, was derived from wearable device data to reliably determine stress-levels. In order to build and train a deployable stress-detector, we collected labeled HRV data in controlled environments, where subjects were exposed to physical, psychological and combined stress. We then applied machine learning to separate and identify the different stress types and understand the relationship with HRV data. The resulting C5 decision tree model is capable of identifying the stress type with 88{\%} accuracy, in a 1-minute time window. For the first time physical and psychological stress can be distinguished with a 1-minute time resolution from smoke-divers, firefighters, who enter high-risk environments to rescue people, and experience intense physical and psychological stress. To improve our model, we created an integrated system to acquire expert labels in real-time from firefighters during their training in a Rescue Maze. A next goal is to transfer the algorithms into generic systems for monitoring and coaching high-risk professionals to improve their stress resilience during training and reduce their risk in the field.}

In this work, we propose a deep-learning-assisted implementation incorporating a wearable device, a base station, a mobile application, and a cloud-based infrastructure that can first monitor in real-time the activity, the audio signals, and the location of a SaR dog, and second, recognize and alert the rescuing team whenever the SaR dog spots a victim. For this purpose, we employed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) both for the activity recognition and the sound classification, which are trained using data from inertial sensors, such as 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope and from the wearable's microphone, respectively. The developed deep learning models were deployed on the wearable device, while the overall proposed implementation was validated in two discrete search and rescue scenarios, managing to successfully spot the victim (i.e., obtained F1-score more than 99{\%}) and inform the rescue team in real-time for both scenarios.}

Assessments were modelled according to the Expanded Technology Acceptance Model measuring participant perceived usefulness of and intention to use the new technology. Inductive coding of qualitative feedback resulted in the identification of central themes.RESULTS: From November 2019 to January 2020, 61 participants were enrolled. Most (98{\%}) participants self-rated above neutral for all skills (mean 4.3; range 1.21-5.00). Regression modelling showed that the perceived ease of use of the VR and ability to produce demonstrable results as likely drivers of further use. Participants agreed that others would benefit from the training (97{\%}), it was representative of actual response scenarios (72{\%}) and they would use lessons learnt in the field (71{\%}). Open-response feedback highlighted feeling being immersed in the training and its utility for public health responders.CONCLUSIONS: At a time when a trained emergency public health workforce is a critical need, VR may be an option for addressing this gap. Participants' impressions and feedback, in the setting of their high skill level and experience, highlighted the utility and benefit of using VR to deliver training. Further research is needed to determine skill acquisition through VR training among a pool of future responders with limited to no response experience.}

Two prototypes were developed to validate the adequacy of the technology.RESULTS: The result is a new community-based model of care called 'Le Bon Samaritain'. It relies on a network of people called 'Bons Samaritains' willing to help and deal with the basic care and safety aspects of their community. Their role is to make sure that people in their community receive and understand the messages from emergency and health services. The new care model is integrated with existing emergency warning, community and health services.CONCLUSION: Le Bon Samaritain model is scalable, community-based and can help people feel safer, less isolated and more integrated in their community. It could be the key to reduce healthcare cost, increase resilience and drive the change for a more integrated emergency and care system.}

Among the former, the following had been found: lack of leadership and support from managers, initial shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), lack of participation in decision making, initial lack of clinical protocols, and slowness and/or lack of adaptability of the system, among others. Among the solutions adopted: reinforcement of emergency call centers, development of specific coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) telephone lines and new resources, personal effort of professionals, new functions of EMS, support to other structures, and reinforcement of the role of nursing.CONCLUSION: The general perception among the respondents was that there was a lack of support and communication with health care managers and that the staff expertise was not used by policy makers to make decisions adapted to reality, also expressing the need to improve the capacity for analysis of the EMS response. Few respondents reported good overall satisfaction with their EMS response. The EMS adopted different types of measures to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.}

 abstract     = {"Technology - Born from Human Nature" is a familiar Taiwan advertising slogan. Healthcare is a profession that is intimately entwined with human nature. In order to keep up with today's fast-changing healthcare environment and the broadly diverse needs of different healthcare settings, how to best use technology to creatively and efficiently develop patient-friendly care services and interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategies is a topic that is now receiving significant and growing attention in this field. The increasing utilization of big data worldwide is allowing us to better understand public needs and to more-accurately predict changing trends. Related technologies apply knowledge from the field of AI learning, as this process requires deep understanding of how target populations think and reason. This technology has the capacity to significantly improve the accuracy of healthcare diagnoses and to better anticipate patient safety risks in terms of prescription medicine use, the reporting of critical test results, and other factors, thus generating savings in terms of time and costs (Cheong, 2018). Furthermore, healthcare education is increasingly emphasizing the use of simulated environments in order to improve scenario-based learning and teaching efficacy. Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) applications help educators overcome the limitations of traditional models of education (Hsieh {\&} Lin, 2017). Educators are now able to incorporate simulations of situations that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to experience otherwise, such as disaster scenes, in-flight medical emergencies, surgeries, emergency rescue scenarios, and gender-care scenarios, into integrated innovative-technology education strategies. Moreover, related technology applications are assisting healthcare professionals to improve their familiarity with clinical techniques, outreach and communication skills, and training. Moreover, whether applied in healthcare education and training, clinical caregiving, emergency medical units, or chronic care settings, these simulation-related, cross-disciplinary technology applications have much to contribute.}

 abstract     = {Digital health innovations for hypertension include cuffless blood pressure sensors, wireless smartphone-enabled upper arm blood pressure monitors, mobile applications, and remote monitoring technologies. Wearable trackers have drawn interest from medical professionals and patients alike. They have the potential to improve hypertension control and medication adherence through easier logging of repeated blood pressure measurements, better connectivity with health-care providers, and medication reminder alerts. With increasing emphasis on home and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to confirm hypertension prior to treatment, such devices also can help improve the diagnostic landscape. However, privacy, accuracy, and cost concerns have prevented widespread clinical uptake. To foster implementation, device designers and clinical researchers should collaborate on development of rigorous clinical trials that test cardiovascular outcomes associated with emerging technologies. We review the current literature on mobile health technologies and novel diagnostic and management protocols and make recommendations on how to incorporate these innovations into practice.}

Despite frequent interface between the health system (HS) and LE sectors, the published evidence that supports their collaboration in injury surveillance, control and prevention has not been comprehensively reviewed.METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of literature published from 1990 to 2016 that focused on local and regional HS and LE collaborations in injury surveillance, control and prevention. Our aim was to describe what is known and what remains unexplored about these cross-sector efforts.RESULTS: 128 articles were included in the final review. These were categorised by their focus on either surveillance activities or partnerships in injury control and prevention programmes. The majority of surveillance articles focused on road traffic injuries. Conversely, articles describing partnerships and programme evaluations primarily targeted the prevention of interpersonal violence.DISCUSSION: This review yielded two major findings: overall, the combination of HS and LE injury data added value to surveillance systems, especially as HS data augmented LE data; and HS and LE partnerships have been developed to improve injury control and prevention. However, there are few studies that have evaluated the impact and sustainability of these partnerships.CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence to support HS and LE collaboration in injury surveillance and control and prevention programmes is heterogeneous. Notable gaps suggest ample opportunity for further research and programme evaluation across all types of injury.}

The up-to-date systems of ambient surveillance energized by CCTV, police wearable cameras, drones, and thermal imaging devices enable the police to thoroughly monitor public spaces as well as to rigorously arrest on-scene criminals. These efforts to improve the level of surveillance are often met with public resistance raising concerns over citizens' rights to privacy. Recent studies on the use of police video equipment have constantly raised the issues related to the lack of applicable legal provisions, risk of personal information and privacy infringement as well as security vulnerabilities. In this regard, the present study attempted to review the public surveillance methods currently used by law enforcement agencies worldwide within the context of public safety and individual rights to privacy. Furthermore, the present study also discussed the legal boundaries of police use of video equipment to address public concerns over privacy issues.}

 abstract     = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine recent trends in imaging utilization in emergency departments (EDs) in the Medicare population.METHODS: The 2002 to 2012 Medicare Part B databases were used. Imaging studies were categorized by modality. Medicare's place-of-service codes identified those studies performed in ED patients. Specialty codes identified the specialties of the interpreting physicians. Utilization rates per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries were calculated. Trends were assessed in plain radiography (XR), CT, noncardiac ultrasound, MRI, and nuclear medicine.RESULTS: XR and CT were the most widely used modalities in ED patients. From 2002 to 2012, the XR utilization rate per 1,000 increased from 248.7 to 320.0 (+29{\%}), and CT increased from 57.2 to 147.9 (+159{\%}). Utilization rates of the other modalities were much lower. Ultrasound increased from 9.5 to 21.0 (+121{\%}), while MRI increased from 1.4 to 5.1 (+264{\%}). Growth in these 4 modalities was continuous and did not show the flattening that has characterized the utilization trends in other places of service. Nuclear medicine use was very low and remained essentially flat. During the study period, CT accrued 91 new examinations per 1,000, followed by XR at 71 and ultrasound at 11.5. The vast majority of examinations were interpreted by radiologists.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the cessation of overall utilization growth of the various modalities in recent years, ED utilization rates continued to increase. The greatest increases, in terms of accrued new examinations per 1,000, were seen in CT and XR. This suggests that radiologists and ED physicians need to work together to better manage imaging utilization.}

Yet, little is known about health care utilization patterns associated with achieving HUD-VASH housing.OBJECTIVES: We compare health service utilization at the VA Greater Los Angeles among: (1) formerly homeless Veterans housed through HUD-VASH (HUD-VASH Veterans); (2) currently homeless Veterans; (3) housed, low-income Veterans not in HUD-VASH; and (4) housed, not low-income Veterans.RESEARCH DESIGN: We performed a secondary database analysis of Veterans (n=62,459) who received VA Greater Los Angeles care between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011. We described medical/surgical and mental health utilization [inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department (ED)]. We controlled for demographics, need, and primary care use in regression analyses of utilization data by housing and income status.RESULTS: HUD-VASH Veterans had more inpatient, outpatient, and ED use than currently homeless Veterans. Adjusting for demographics and need, HUD-VASH Veterans and the low-income housed Veterans had similar likelihoods of medical/surgical inpatient and outpatient utilization, compared with the housed, not low-income group. Adjusting first for demographics and need (model 1), then also for primary care use (model 2), HUD-VASH Veterans had the greatest decrease in incident rates of specialty medical/surgical, mental health, and ED care from models 1 to 2, becoming similar to the currently homeless, compared with the housed, not low-income group.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that currently homeless Veterans underuse health care relative to housed Veterans. HUD-VASH may address this disparity by providing housing and linkages to primary care.}

 abstract     = {Ambient intelligence plays a crucial role in healthcare situations. It provides a certain way to deal with emergencies to provide the essential resources such as nearest hospitals and emergency stations promptly to avoid deaths. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, several artificial intelligence techniques have been used. However, situation awareness is a key aspect to handling any pandemic situation. The situation-awareness approach gives patients a routine life where they are continuously monitored by caregivers through wearable sensors and alert the practitioners in case of any patient emergency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a situation-aware mechanism to detect Covid-19 systems early and alert the user to be self-aware regarding the situation to take precautions if the situation seems unlikely to be normal. We provide Belief-Desire-Intention intelligent reasoning mechanism for the system to analyze the situation after acquiring the data from the wearable sensors and alert the user according to their environment. We use the case study for further demonstration of our proposed framework. We model the proposed system by temporal logic and map the system illustration into a simulation tool called NetLogo to determine the results of the proposed system.}

 abstract     = {Because contractions signal the approach of labor, pregnant women-especially primigravidas (i.e., women pregnant for the first time)-usually go to the hospital to seek medical intervention when they begin experiencing contractions, which is not conductive to good perinatal outcomes. Conventionally, uterine contraction monitoring requires specialized medical devices and relies on the doctor's clinical experience. Therefore, exploring an objective method to detect labor onset at home and avoid early hospital admission has essential importance. In this article, a labor progress monitoring system based on a sensing device, edge service, and Internet of things (IoT) platform is proposed, aiming to suggest suitable hospital admission times for low-risk primigravidas. The pregnant woman places the sensing device on her abdomen with the help of a belt to detect contraction activities. An intelligent edge service for contraction classification is deployed on a mobile phone. The system's artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted algorithm is lightweight, with 670 kB and 194 kB of memory dedicated to a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory, respectively. It classifies the pregnant woman as deferred admission, optional admission, or recommended admission according to different contraction states. An IoT platform connected to the hospital is implemented, providing professional suggestions from doctors. The test set collected in an emergency clinic shows that the proposed system can reach a classification accuracy of more than 96{\%}. In conclusion, the proposed system enables remote labor progress monitoring at home and avoids early hospital admission.}

However, few information systems are available regarding escape guidelines for nuclear accidents. Therefore, this study constructs escape guidelines on mobile phones. This application is called Mobile Escape Guidelines (MEG) and adopts two techniques. One technique is the geographical information that offers multiple representations; the other is the augmented reality that provides semi-realistic information services. When this study tested the mobile escape guidelines, the results showed that this application was capable of identifying the correct locations of users, showing the escape routes, filtering geographical layers, and rapidly generating the relief reports. Users could evacuate from nuclear accident sites easily, even without relief personnel, since using slim devices to access the mobile escape guidelines is convenient.

The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the feasibility of radio-frequency identification tags to measure clinician-patient contact and (2) to test the relationship between ED occupancy and clinician-patient contact time.METHODS: In this 4-week observational study, radio-frequency identification tags were worn by emergency clinicians in a 21-bay urban teaching hospital emergency department. The time-motion data were merged with electronic medical repository patient information (N = 3,237) to adjust for occupancy, age, gender, and acuity. Qualitative themes were generated from focus group (N = 39) debriefings of the quantitative results.RESULTS: Data were collected on 56,342 total clinician events. Adjusting for patient age, increasing ED occupancy increased the number of times the attending physician entered and left the patient room (b = 0 .008, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = [0.001-0.016], P = 0.03). There was no relationship for patient gender, triage acuity, shift at arrival, disposition to home, or discharge diagnosis category with either total minutes or number of encounters per patient visit. No time-motion and occupancy associations were observed for nurses, residents, or nurse practitioners/physician assistants. Debriefings indicated occupancy influenced the quality of care, despite maintaining the same quantity of contact time.DISCUSSION: The physical environment and clinician privacy concerns limit the feasibility of wearable tracking technology in the emergency setting. Attending physician care becomes more fragmented with increasing ED occupancy. Other clinicians report changes in the quality of care, whereas the quantity of time and encounters were unchanged with occupancy rates.}

Heart rate variability (HRV)-based seizure detection devices have presented good detection sensitivity. However, false alarm rates (FAR) are too high.METHODS: In this phase-2 study we pursued to decrease the FAR, by using patient-adaptive logistic regression machine learning (LRML) to improve the performance of a previously published HRV-based seizure detection algorithm. ECG-data were prospectively collected using a dedicated wearable electrocardiogram-device during long-term video-EEG monitoring. Sixty-two patients had 174 seizures during 4,614h recording. The dataset was divided into training-, cross-validation-, and test-sets (chronological) in order to avoid overfitting. Patients with >50 beats/min change in heart rate during first recorded seizure were selected as responders. We compared 18 LRML-settings to find the optimal algorithm.RESULTS: The patient-adaptive LRML-classifier in combination with using only responders to train the initial decision boundary was superior to both the generic approach and including non-responders to train the LRML-classifier. Using the optimal setting of the LRML in responders in the test dataset yielded a sensitivity of 78.2{\%} and FAR of 0.62/24h. The FAR was reduced by 31{\%} compared to the previous method, upholding similar sensitivity.CONCLUSION: The novel, patient-adaptive LRML seizure detection algorithm outperformed both the generic approach and the previously published patient-tailored method. The proposed method can be implemented in a wearable online HRV-based seizure detection system alerting patients and caregivers of seizures and improve seizure-count which may help optimizing the patient treatment.}

Participants were registrants in an EMS course on MCI triage broadcast from University of California, Irvine Medical Simulation Center. The intervention was a Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) course. The primary outcome was successful implementation of the course via telesimulation. The secondary outcome was an assessment of participant thoughts, feelings, and attitudes via a qualitative survey. We also sought to obtain quantitative data that would allow for the assessment of triage accuracy. Descriptive statistics were used to express the percentage of participants with favorable responses to survey questions.RESULTS: All 32 participants enrolled in the course provided a favorable response to all questions on the survey regarding their thoughts, feelings, and attitudes toward learning via telesimulation with wearable/mobile technology. Key barriers and challenges identified included dependability of Internet connection, choosing appropriate software platforms to deliver content, and intercontinental time difference considerations. The protocol detailed in this study demonstrated the successful implementation and feasibility of providing education and training to learners at an off-site location.CONCLUSION: In this feasibility study, we were able to demonstrate the successful implementation of an intercontinental MCI triage course using telesimulation and wearable/mobile technology. Healthcare providers expressed a positive favorability toward learning MCI triage via telesimulation. We were also able to establish a process to obtain quantitative data that would allow for the calculation of triage accuracy for further experimental study designs.}

The system includes continuous collection and evaluation of multiple vital signs, intelligent multiparameter medical emergency detection, and a cellular connection to a medical center. By integrating the whole system in an unobtrusive, wrist-worn enclosure and applying aggressive low-power design techniques, continuous long-term monitoring can be performed without interfering with the patients' everyday activities and without restricting their mobility. In the first two and a half years of this EU IST sponsored project, the AMON consortium has designed, implemented, and tested the described wrist-worn device, a communication link, and a comprehensive medical center software package. The performance of the system has been validated by a medical study with a set of 33 subjects. The paper describes the main concepts behind the AMON system and presents details of the individual subsystems and solutions as well as the results of the medical validation.}

The next generation for clinical laboratory testing may be devices that are worn or attached to the patient.CONTENT: POCT devices that are designed where samples are tested directly on the patient include bilirubinometers, pulse oximeters, breathalyzers (for alcohol and, more recently, cannabinoid detection), transcutaneous blood gas analyses, and novel testing applications such as glucose and tumor signatures following surgical excision. The utility of these devices with special reference for use within the intensive care unit and the emergency department is reviewed.SUMMARY: It is likely that wearable POCT devices will be developed in the future that can meet current and emerging clinical needs. Advancements in biomedical engineering and information technology will be needed in the creation of next-generation devices.}

Recent advances toward wearable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have ignited tremendous interest in expanding such sensor technology to other important fields. This article reviews for the first time wearable electrochemical sensors for monitoring therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse. This rapidly emerging class of drug-sensing wearable devices addresses the growing demand for personalized medicine, toward improved therapeutic outcomes while minimizing the side effects of drugs and the related medical expenses. Continuous, noninvasive monitoring of therapeutic drugs within bodily fluids empowers clinicians and patients to correlate the pharmacokinetic properties with optimal outcomes by realizing patient-specific dose regulation and tracking dynamic changes in pharmacokinetics behavior while assuring the medication adherence of patients. Furthermore, wearable electrochemical drug monitoring devices can also serve as powerful screening tools in the hands of law enforcement agents to combat drug trafficking and support on-site forensic investigations. The review covers various wearable form factors developed for noninvasive monitoring of therapeutic drugs in different body fluids and toward on-site screening of drugs of abuse. The future prospects of such wearable drug monitoring devices are presented with the ultimate goals of introducing accurate real-time drug monitoring protocols and autonomous closed-loop platforms toward precise dose regulation and optimal therapeutic outcomes. Finally, current unmet challenges and existing gaps are discussed for motivating future technological innovations regarding personalized therapy. The current pace of developments and the tremendous market opportunities for such wearable drug monitoring platforms are expected to drive intense future research and commercialization efforts.}

The ED arrival time, time to being seen by an emergency physician (EP), time to CT scan, and time to neurology consultation were obtained by medical record review.RESULTS: The median delay (interquartile range) from ED arrival to being seen by an EP for the 170 eligible subjects was 0.42 (0.20-0.75) hours. The median delay to CT scan was 1.88 hours (1.25-2.67) and the median delay to neurology consultation was 2.42 hours (1.50-3.48). Age, race, sex, and hospital discharge diagnosis had little influence on delay. Subjects arriving by emergency medical services (EMS) had a significantly shorter time to being seen by an EP (0.33 vs 0.50 hours) when compared with those who arrived by other means. Time to CT scan was shorter by 0.5 hours for patients arriving by EMS as well. These differences persisted when stratified by out-of-hospital delay times.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that arriving by EMS is associated with shorter times to being seen by an EP and receiving a CT scan. The influence of EMS on delays associated with rapid medical care of stroke patients reaches beyond the out-of-hospital transport phase.}

Participant responses were compared to UK national recommendations and to a previous survey in 2009.RESULTS: A total of 98 specialist registrars (in Anesthesiology, n=51; in Emergency Medicine (EM), n=21; and in Intensive Care Medicine (ICM) n=26) completed hand-delivered surveys. The best knowledge of PPE requirements (76{\%}) was found for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with less knowledge about PPE requirements for anthrax, plague, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and smallpox (60{\%}). The results show limited knowledge of PPE requirements (20{\%}-30{\%}) for various chemical warfare agents. Personal protective equipment knowledge regarding treatment of sarin-contaminated casualties was over-rated by 80{\%}, and for patients with EVD, it was over-rated by up to 67{\%} of participants.CONCLUSION: The results of the tested cohort indicate that current knowledge regarding PPE for chemical warfare agents remains very limited.}

Four interventions for promoting voluntary exercise training among firefighters (i.e., virtual reality exercise system intervention, poster intervention, monitor intervention, and wearable health device intervention) were performed in a fire station located in Seoul, South Korea. To evaluate reach and dose received related to each intervention, participants were asked to answer several simple questions. Three process evaluators completed a 20-item survey to share their impressions related to the quality of intervention delivery. Paired t test was used to examine mean changes in primary (i.e., mean minutes of exercise training per week) and secondary outcomes (i.e., beliefs and intention) between pre- and postinterventions. More than 60{\%} of participants experienced monitor and wearable health device interventions. Process evaluators tend not to agree with a statement saying that the number of the virtual reality exercise equipment was appropriate. Among firefighters who participated in exercise training less than 150 min per week at 1-month follow-up, mean minutes of exercise training per week increased by 67.95 min after interventions. Future studies need to examine whether the monitor and wearable health device interventions effectively increase exercise training participation among firefighters in other fire stations located in Seoul, South Korea.}

Recently, the sensor network technology, which composes of the sensor interface for small-seize hardware, processor, the wireless communication module and battery in small sized hardware, has been extended to the area of bio-senor network systems due to the advances of the MEMS technology. In this paper we have suggested a design and implementation of a health care information system(called u-EMS) using a bio-sensor network technology that is a combination of the bio-sensor and the sensor network technology. In proposed system, we have used the following vital body sensors such as EKG sensor, the blood pressure sensor, the heart rate sensor, the pulse oximeter sensor and the glucose sensor. We have collected various vital sign data through the sensor network module and processed the data to implement a health care measurement system. Such measured data can be displayed by the wireless terminal(PDA, Cell phone) and the digital-frame display device. Finally, we have conducted a series of tests which considered both patient's vital sign and context-awared information in order to improve the effectiveness of the u-EMS.}

The authors measured the acquisition of triage skills by novice learners after exposing them to three sequential scenarios (A, B, and C) of five simulated patients each in a fully immersed three-dimensional VR environment. The hypothesis was that learners would improve in speed, accuracy, and self-efficacy.METHODS: Twenty-four medical students were taught principles of mass casualty triage using three short podcasts, followed by an immersive VR exercise in which learners donned a head-mounted display (HMD) and three motion tracking sensors, one for their head and one for each hand. They used a gesture-based command system to interact with multiple VR casualties. For triage score, one point was awarded for each correctly identified main problem, required intervention, and triage category. For intervention score, one point was awarded for each correct VR intervention. Scores were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each student. Before and after surveys were used to measure self-efficacy and reaction to the training.RESULTS: Four students were excluded from analysis due to participation in a recent triage research program. Results from 20 students were analyzed. Triage scores and intervention scores improved significantly during Scenario B (p < 0.001). Time to complete each scenario decreased significantly from A (8:10 minutes) to B (5:14 minutes; p < 0.001) and from B to C (3:58 minutes; p < 0.001). Self-efficacy improved significantly in the areas of prioritizing treatment, prioritizing resources, identifying high-risk patients, and beliefs about learning to be an effective first responder.CONCLUSIONS: Novice learners demonstrated improved triage and intervention scores, speed, and self-efficacy during an iterative, fully immersed VR triage experience.}

The ProeTEX project is one of many initiatives dedicated to the development of smart garments specifically designed for people who risk their lives in the line of duty such as fire fighters and Civil Protection rescuers. These garments have integrated multipurpose sensors that monitor their activities while in action. To this aim, we have developed an algorithm that combines both features extracted from the signal of a triaxial accelerometer and one ECG lead. Microprocessors integrated in the garments detect the signal magnitude area of inertial acceleration, step frequency, trunk inclination, heart rate (HR), and HR trend in real time. Given these inputs, a classifier assigns these signals to nine classes differentiating between certain physical activities (walking, running, moving on site), intensities (intense, mild, or at rest) and postures (lying down, standing up). Specific classes will be identified as dangerous to the rescuer during operation, such as, subject motionless lying down or subject resting with abnormal HR. Laboratory tests were carried out on seven healthy adult subjects with the collection of over 4.5 h of data. The results were very positive, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 88.8{\%}.}

Two managers and thirteen physicians (from four community health centers and stations) participated. The data were analyzed using a thematic inductive analysis approach.RESULTS: Based on our interviews, most of the physicians were not fully trained as general practitioners but still assumed the duties of that position; they were supposed to eventually become fully trained in line with the reforms of the Chinese primary care system. However, they reported a lack of in-service training opportunities to fulfill this goal. Even those who said that they had such opportunities perceived the efficacy of that training as being poor. The managers and most of the physicians reacted positively to the idea of using augmented reality in continuing professional development, and they suggested antibiotics treatment, surgery, and emergency care as learning areas in which augmented reality could be applied.CONCLUSIONS: Due to the Chinese reforms of the primary care system, both managers and the physicians themselves expect general practitioners to become qualified by engaging in continuing professional development. Both groups also regarded augmented reality as a potentially useful tool.}

 abstract     = {Wearable sensors allow continuous monitoring of metabolites for diabetes, sports medicine, exercise science, and physiology research. These sensors can continuously detect target analytes in skin interstitial fluid (ISF), tears, saliva, and sweat. In this review, we will summarize developments on wearable devices and their potential applications in research, clinical practice, and recreational and sporting activities. Sampling skin ISF can require insertion of a needle into the skin, whereas sweat, tears, and saliva can be sampled by devices worn outside the body. The most widely sampled metabolite from a wearable device is glucose in skin ISF for monitoring diabetes patients. Continuous ISF glucose monitoring allows estimation of the glucose concentration in blood without the pain, inconvenience, and blood waste of fingerstick capillary blood glucose testing. This tool is currently used by diabetes patients to provide information for dosing insulin and determining a diet and exercise plan. Similar technologies for measuring concentrations of other analytes in skin ISF could be used to monitor athletes, emergency responders, warfighters, and others in states of extreme physiological stress. Sweat is a potentially useful substrate for sampling analytes for metabolic monitoring during exercise. Lactate, sodium, potassium, and hydrogen ions can be measured in sweat. Tools for converting the concentrations of these analytes sampled from sweat, tears, and saliva into blood concentrations are being developed. As an understanding of the relationships between the concentrations of analytes in blood and easily sampled body fluid increases, then the benefits of new wearable devices for metabolic monitoring will also increase.}

 abstract     = {This study presents a novel wireless, ambulatory, real-time, and autoalarm intelligent telecardiology system to improve healthcare for cardiovascular disease, which is one of the most prevalent and costly health problems in the world. This system consists of a lightweight and power-saving wireless ECG device equipped with a built-in automatic warning expert system. This device is connected to a mobile and ubiquitous real-time display platform. The acquired ECG signals are instantaneously transmitted to mobile devices, such as netbooks or mobile phones through Bluetooth, and then, processed by the expert system. An alert signal is sent to the remote database server, which can be accessed by an Internet browser, once an abnormal ECG is detected. The current version of the expert system can identify five types of abnormal cardiac rhythms in real-time, including sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, wide QRS complex, atrial fibrillation (AF), and cardiac asystole, which is very important for both the subjects who are being monitored and the healthcare personnel tracking cardiac-rhythm disorders. The proposed system also activates an emergency medical alarm system when problems occur. Clinical testing reveals that the proposed system is approximately 94{\%} accurate, with high sensitivity, specificity, and positive prediction rates for ten normal subjects and 20 AF patients. We believe that in the future a business-card-like ECG device, accompanied with a mobile phone, can make universal cardiac protection service possible.}

Many countries are facing rising opioid overdose deaths and have been implementing rapid opioid overdose response Systems (ROORS). We describe how technology is increasingly being used in ROORS design, implementation and delivery.RECENT FINDINGS: Technology can contribute in significant ways to ROORS design, implementation, and delivery. Artificial intelligence-based modelling and simulations alongside wastewater-based epidemiology can be used to inform policy decisions around naloxone access laws and effective naloxone distribution strategies. Data linkage and machine learning projects can support service delivery organizations to mobilize and distribute community resources in support of ROORS. Digital phenotyping is an advancement in data linkage and machine learning projects, potentially leading to precision overdose responses. At the coalface, opioid overdose detection devices through fixed location or wearable sensors, improved connectivity, smartphone applications and drone-based emergency naloxone delivery all have a role in improving outcomes from opioid overdose. Data driven technologies also have an important role in empowering community responses to opioid overdose.SUMMARY: This review highlights the importance of technology applied to every aspect of ROORS. Key areas of development include the need to protect marginalized groups from algorithmic bias, a better understanding of individual overdose trajectories and new reversal agents and improved drug delivery methods.}

 abstract     = {Smart home technology with situation-awareness is important for seniors to improve safety and security. With the development of context-aware computing, wearable sensor technology, and ubiquitous computing, it is easier for seniors to manage their health problem in smart home environment. For monitoring senior activity in smart home, wearable, and motion sensors-such as respiration rate (RR), electrocardiography (ECG), body temperature, and blood pressure (BP)-were used for monitoring movements of seniors. For context-awareness, environmental sensors-such as gas, fire, smoke, dust, temperature, and light sensors-were used for senior location data collection. Based on senior activity, senior health status can be classified into positive and negative. Based on senior location and time, senior safety is classified into safe and emergency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid inspection service middleware for monitoring elderly health risk based on senior activity and location. This hybrid-aware model for the detection of abnormal status of seniors has four steps as follows: (1) data collection from biosensors and environmental sensors; (2) monitoring senior location and time of stay in each location using environmental sensors; (3) monitoring senior activity using biometric data; finally, (4) expectation-maximization based decision-making step recommending proper treatment based on a senior health risk ratio.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: First responders and military personnel experience rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) far in excess of the general population. Although exposure to acute traumatic events plays a role in the genesis of these disorders, in this review, we present an argument that the occupational and environmental conditions where these workers operate are also likely contributors.PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: First responders and military personnel face occupational exposures that have been associated with altered immune and inflammatory activity. In turn, these physiological responses are linked to altered moods and feelings of well-being which may provide priming conditions that compromise individual resilience, and increase the risk of PTSD and depression when subsequently exposed to acute traumatic events. These exposures include heat, smoke, and sleep restriction, and physical injury often alongside heavy physical exertion. Provided the stimulus is sufficient, these exposures have been linked to inflammatory activity and modification of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), offering a mechanism for the high rates of PTSD and depressive disorders in these occupations.TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: To test this hypothesis in the future, a case-control approach is suggested that compares individuals with PTSD or depressive disorders with healthy colleagues in a retrospective framework. This approach should characterise the relationships between altered immune and inflammatory activity and health outcomes. Wearable technology, surveys, and formal experimentation in the field will add useful data to these investigations.IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Inflammatory changes, linked with occupational exposures in first responders and military personnel, would highlight the need for a risk management approach to work places. Risk management strategies could focus on reducing exposure, ensuring recovery, and increasing resilience to these risk contributors to minimise the rates of PTSD and depressive disorders in vulnerable occupations.}

Cumulative counts over subsequent intervals (months 1-3, months 1-6, months 2 through 6) were tallied.RESULTS: The studies randomised 2428 patients. Over month 1, 24.6{\%}, 22.8{\%} and 12.5{\%} of patients were composite responders with eluxadoline 100 mg, eluxadoline 75 mg and placebo respectively. For month 1 responders, 77.8{\%} and 81.5{\%} (over months 1-3) and 70.7{\%} and 73.9{\%} (over months 1-6) showed a continuous response with eluxadoline 100 mg and 75 mg respectively. [Correction added on 5 April 2017, after first online publication: The percentage for the responders over months 1-3 was previously wrong and has been corrected.] Of the month 1 nonresponders, <20{\%} showed a response over months 1-3 or months 1-6. Similar results were seen for the analysis of proportions of AR responders over these time intervals.CONCLUSIONS: Over two-thirds of patients who respond over the first month retain a positive response over 6 months of treatment with eluxadoline, indicating that early clinical response to eluxadoline is associated with sustained benefits for up to 6 months in patients with IBS-D.}

Our aim was to understand if e-technology can enhance the safety and quality of older adult care by detecting changes in health status early.METHODS: E-technology was implemented with 30 seniors in an assisted living facility. We used wireless devices to monitor blood pressure, oxygen saturation, weight, and hydration. This 1-year feasibility study included: a readiness assessment, procuring devices, developing an alert software, training staff, and weekly monitoring for several months.RESULTS: Analysis of service utilization data showed no significant differences in number of emergency or hospital visits between the intervention and control group. Qualitative data suggested residents were satisfied with the e-technology. Among staff, several saw value in weekly monitoring, however staff emphasized the need for devices to be suitable for older adults.CONCLUSION: It is imperative that researchers work with facilities to ensure there is value-added in implementing new technology. Staff feedback helped fine-tune devices, training materials, and measurement process. It took longer than anticipated to procure suitable devices, set up the software, and recruit residents, thus limiting data collection. Future studies should dedicate more time to implementation and propose longer timelines.}

Therefore, considering the aspects such as installation space, construction costs, maintenance costs, user characteristics, and education effects, other than for those trainings where real models and objects are more effective such as first aid training, it is with a strong recommendation that establishing military safety training facilities with VR/AR (Virtual and augmented reality) is a must in the coming future. We have derived the need for hands-on training  by considering the development of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), analysis of operation status of the public safety experience centers, characteristics of military units, installation and maintenance costs, and proposed plan to establish safety training centers where effective training performance can be achieved at a lower cost than the public safety experience center. In addition, we suggested the scale of the required safety training center and the composition of the experience rooms considering the number of trainees and the environment of each military units. Given this analysis it will contribute to the prevention of military safety and suicide by building a safety training center in the future.}

The aim of this study is the development of a wearable gas sensor for the detection of NH3 at room temperature based on the organic semiconductor poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), electrochemically deposited iridium oxide particles, and a hydrogel film. The hydrogel composition was finely optimised to obtain self-healing properties, as well as the desired porosity, adhesion to the substrate, and stability in humidity variations. Its chemical structure and morphology were characterised by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively, and were found to play a key role in the transduction process and in the achievement of a reversible and selective response. The sensing properties rely on a potentiometric-like mechanism that significantly differs from most of the state-of-the-art NH3 gas sensors and provides superior robustness to the final device. Thanks to the reliability of the analytical response, the simple two-terminal configuration and the low power consumption, the PEDOT:PSS/IrOx Ps/hydrogel sensor was realised on a flexible plastic foil and successfully tested in a wearable configuration with wireless connectivity to a smartphone. The wearable sensor showed stability to mechanical deformations and good analytical performances, with a sensitivity of 60 {\textpm} 8 muA decade-1 in a wide concentration range (17-7899 ppm), which includes the safety limits set by law for NH3 exposure.}

It explores how continuous vital signs monitoring can be integrated into the ED. The article presents four shortcomings on current ED triage systems and proposes a new conceptual clinical decision support model that exploits the benefits of combining wireless wearable devices with Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to address those shortcomings. A literature review was conducted using various engineering and medical research databases, analyzing current practices and identifying potential improvement opportunities. The results from the literature review show that advancements in wireless wearable devices provide opportunities to enhance current ED processes by monitoring patients while they wait after triage and, therefore, reduce the risk of an adverse event. A dynamic mathematical decision support model to prioritize patients is presented, creating a feedback loop in the ED. The coupling of wearable devices (to collect data) with decision theory (to synthesize and organize the information) can assist in reducing sources of uncertainty inherent to ED systems. The authors also address the feasibility of the proposed conceptual model.}

A laboratory protocol was conducted among 6 firefighters, including a laboratory stress-inducer task - the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST) - and a 2-choice reaction time task (CRTT) that was performed before (CRTT1) and after (CRTT2) the stress condition. ECG signals were continuously acquired using the VitalJacket, a wearable t-shirt that acts as a medical certified ECG monitor. Results showed that ECG morphological features such as QT and ST intervals are able to differentiate stressful from non stressful events in first responders. Group mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for stress assessment significantly increased after the stress task (TSST), relatively to the end of CRTT2 (after TSST: 4.67{\textpm}1.63; after CRTT2: 3.17{\textpm}0.75), a change that was accompanied by a significant increase in group mean QT and ST segments corrected for heart rate during TSST.

So far, we have only verified our system's effectiveness under constantly wired network conditions. To determine its FAST performance within an emergency vehicle, we extended it to a WiMAX mobile network and performed experiments on it. Experiment results showed that paramedics could attach the system to FAST areas on a patient's body on the basis of the attaching position and procedure.

The first phase presents the identification process to propose a decision matrix (DM) on the basis of a crossover of 'multi-healthcare services' and 'hospital list' within intelligent data and service management centre (Tier 4). The second phase discusses the development of a DM for hospital selection on the basis of integrated VIKOR-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods. Finally, the last phase examines the validation process for the proposed framework.}

 abstract     = {Wireless technologies and vehicle-mounted or wearable medical sensors are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications. However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by radio frequency transmission. A high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors, and in such a scenario, a few users who are not transmitting emergency data could be required to reduce their transmit power or even temporarily disconnect from the network in order to guarantee the normal operation of medical sensors as well as the transmission of emergency data. In this paper, we propose a joint power and admission control algorithm to schedule the users' transmission of medical data. The objective of this algorithm is to minimize the number of users who are forced to disconnect from the network while keeping the EMI on medical sensors at an acceptable level. We show that a fixed point of proposed algorithm always exists, and at the fixed point, our proposed algorithm can minimize the number of low-priority users who are required to disconnect from the network. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve robust performance against the variations of mobile hospital environments.}

A 12-month period from 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2015 was compared as the pre-Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units period. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods were used. This included semi-structured interviews of 30 Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units patients and 30 emergency department staff (10 of each for all 3 sites), patient survey, statistical analysis of Client Management Interface data for the emergency department and related Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units as well as audit of RISKMAN registers.RESULTS: There were 365 Austin, 567 Eastern and 791 Peninsula Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units admissions. Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units were generally well accepted by patients and emergency department staff, relatively safe, operating within the Key Performance Indicators with mixed effect on emergency department flow. Austin emergency department processing times improved post-Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units (4hours 57minutes to 4 hours 19minutes; p<0.001) while deteriorating at Eastern and Peninsula. Adjustment Disorder and Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder were the most common admission diagnoses. While the Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units had mixed utility on emergency department processing times, they appear to serve a demographic not previously accommodated in traditional emergency department psychiatry models.CONCLUSION: The emergency department-embedded Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Unit model of care appears effective on some measures, safe and acceptable to patients and staff. The Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units seem to service a group not previously accommodated in traditional emergency psychiatry models.}

Wearable electrochemical drug detection devices possess the potential to function as potent screening instruments in the possession of law enforcement personnel, aiding in the fight against drug trafficking and facilitating forensic investigations conducted on site. These wearable sensors are promising alternatives to traditional detection methods. In this study, we present a novel wearable electrochemical glove-based analytical device (eGAD) designed especially for detecting the club drug, methamphetamine. To develop this sensor, we immobilized meth aptamer onto silver nanoparticle (AgNPs)-modified electrodes that were printed onto latex gloves. The characteristics of AgNPs, including their shape, size and purity were analysed using FTIR, SEM and UV vis spectrometry, confirming the successful synthesis. The developed sensor shows a 0.1 g/mL limit of detection and 0.3 g/mL limit of quantification with a linear concentration range of about 0.01-5 g/mL and recovery percentages of approximately 102 and 103{\%}, respectively. To demonstrate its applicability, we tested the developed wearable sensor by spiking various alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink samples. We found that the sensor remains effective for 60 days, making it a practical option with a reasonable shelf-life. The developed sensor offers several advantages, including its affordability, ease of handling and high sensitivity and selectivity. Its portable nature makes it an ideal tool for rapid detection of METH in beverages too.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Mixed reality has been used in trauma and emergency medicine simulation for more than a decade. As mixed reality potential in trauma simulation continues to expand, so too does the need to validate it as a surrogate for real-life emergency scenarios. Validation of these simulations can occur by measuring fidelity, or the degree to which a computing system can reproduce real-world experiences. After performing a literature review, we determined that most fidelity assessments of trauma and emergency simulations focus on how the user subjectively experiences the simulation. Although subjective user assessment is an important component of determining fidelity, we pose an introductory three-part framework that may assess mixed reality trauma simulation more adequately.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Uniformed Services University PowerER search database. Relevant articles were assessed to identify how studies measured fidelity in trauma simulation. We then designed the three-part framework to aid researchers in assessing the fidelity of mixed reality trauma simulations.RESULTS: The domains we determined to best assess mixed reality emergency simulation are as follows:1. Continue assessing fidelity via subjective user assessments. This allows the researcher to know how real the simulation looked and felt to the user based on their individual report.2. Determine whether the trauma simulation changes the medical decision-making capacity of the user. If the user's decision-making capacity changes with a stress-inducing trauma simulation versus a non-stress-inducing simulation, then the stress-inducing trauma environment would be approaching greater fidelity.3. Study the domain of our newly proposed concept: physiologic fidelity. We define physiologic fidelity as the degree to which the simulation elicits a measurable, autonomic response independent of observed emotion or perceived affect. Recreating objective autonomic arousal may be the best way to ensure a trauma simulation reaches fidelity.CONCLUSION: We propose a methodology to assess mixed reality trauma simulation fidelity. Once fidelity is more fully known to the researcher and the simulation user, adjustments can be made to approach reality more closely. Improved simulators may enrich the preparedness of both junior and senior learners for real-life emergencies. We believe assessing the three domains using the Wide Area Virtual Experience at the Val G. Hemming simulation center in Bethesda, MD, will validate mixed reality-trauma simulators as invaluable surrogates for real-life emergency scenarios and ultimately contribute to improved clinical outcomes for clinicians and their patients.}

The Wearable Health Monitoring System (WHMS) is used to manage and monitor chronic disease in elderly people, postoperative rehabilitation patients and persons with special needs. Location-aware healthcare is achievable as positioning systems and telecommunications have been developed and have fulfilled the technology needed for this kind of healthcare system. In this paper, the researchers propose a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (LMCES) to track the patient's current location when Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has been activated as well as to locate the nearest healthcare unit for the ambulance service. The location coordinates of the patients can be retrieved by GPS and sent to the healthcare centre using GPRS. The location of the patient, cell ID information will also be transmitted to the LMCES server in order to retrieve the nearest health care unit. For the LMCES, we use Dijkstra's algorithm for selecting the shortest path between the nearest healthcare unit and the patient location in order to facilitate the ambulance's path under critical conditions.}

 abstract     = {Face masks are an important way to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the prolonged pandemic has revealed confounding problems with the current face masks, including not only the spread of the disease but also concurrent psychological, social, and economic complications. As face masks have been worn for a long time, people have been interested in expanding the purpose of masks from protection to comfort and health, leading to the release of various "smart" mask products around the world. To envision how the smart masks will be extended, this paper reviewed 25 smart masks (12 from commercial products and 13 from academic prototypes) that emerged after the pandemic. While most smart masks presented in the market focus on resolving problems with user breathing discomfort, which arise from prolonged use, academic prototypes were designed for not only sensing COVID-19 but also general health monitoring aspects. Further, we investigated several specific sensors that can be incorporated into the mask for expanding biophysical features. On a larger scale, we discussed the architecture and possible applications with the help of connected smart masks. Namely, beyond a personal sensing application, a group or community sensing application may share an aggregate version of information with the broader population. In addition, this kind of collaborative sensing will also address the challenges of individual sensing, such as reliability and coverage. Lastly, we identified possible service application fields and further considerations for actual use. Along with daily-life health monitoring, smart masks may function as a general respiratory health tool for sports training, in an emergency room or ambulatory setting, as protection for industry workers and firefighters, and for soldier safety and survivability. For further considerations, we investigated design aspects in terms of sensor reliability and reproducibility, ergonomic design for user acceptance, and privacy-aware data-handling. Overall, we aim to explore new possibilities by examining the latest research, sensor technologies, and application platform perspectives for smart masks as one of the promising wearable devices. By integrating biomarkers of respiration symptoms, a smart mask can be a truly cutting-edge device that expands further knowledge on health monitoring to reach the next level of wearables.}

Unsupervised classification of high risk falls activities are used to facilitate an immediate response from caregivers by alerting them of the high risk activity, the particular patient, and their location. Early identification of high risk falls activities through a longitudinal and unsupervised setting in real-time allows the preventative intervention to be administered in a timely manner. Furthermore, real-time detection allows emergency protocols to be deployed immediately in the event of a fall.

It revolutionizes the practice of medicine by making innovative treatment forms possible by the accelerated exchange of patient data. In this way it brings tremendous advantages to all stakeholders in healthcare delivery. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity, the decreasing number of physicians, long distances and poor road infrastructure between doctors and patients create loopholes in the delivery of healthcare services, especially in rural regions, which can at least partially be filled by the use of telemedicine. The acceptance of ehealth is the most important success factor in its use for the management of patients. User-friendliness, efficiency, effectiveness, legal safety and reimbursement of telemedical services are the important conditions for this. Furthermore, training and continuing training of healthcare personnel also drive the development of telemedicine. Factors delaying the use of telemedicine are partial lack of reimbursement and lack of interoperability among different systems of medical technology. Pilot projects serve to provide evidence for the usefulness and effectiveness of telemedicine. They also help to build the structural foundation on which telemedicine can develop. Examples of such projects are emergency triage, online video consultations and digital care projects. There are many emerging trends in the field of digital health, which are developing at different paces. Examples of such trends are artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain and augmented reality.}

We sought to determine a non-invasive technique for objective stress monitoring. Data were collected from firefighters during 24-h shifts using sensor belts equipped with a dry-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) and a three-axial accelerometer. Levels of stress experienced during fire incidents were evaluated via a brief self-assessment questionnaire. Types of physical activity were distinguished basing on accelerometer readings, and heart rate variability (HRV) time series were segmented accordingly into corresponding fragments. Those segments were classified as stress/no-stress conditions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed true positive classification as stress condition for 15{\%} of incidents (while maintaining almost zero False Positive Rate), which parallels the amount of truly stressful incidents reported in the questionnaires. These results show a firm correspondence between the perceived stress level and physiological data. Psychophysiological measurements are reliable indicators of stress even in ecological settings and appear promising for chronic stress monitoring in high-risk jobs, such as firefighting.}

 abstract     = {Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in the development of wearable sensor systems for continuous health monitoring in the home and community settings. One of the main areas of application for these wearable sensor systems is in detecting emergency events such as falls. Wearable sensors like accelerometers are increasingly being used to monitor daily activities of individuals at a risk of falls, detect emergency events and send alerts to caregivers. However, such systems tend to have a high rate of false alarms, which leads to low compliance levels. Home robots can enable caregivers with the ability to quickly make an assessment and intervene if an emergency event is detected. This can provide an additional layer for detecting false positives, which can lead to improve compliance. In this paper, we present preliminary work on the development of a fall detection system based on a combination sensor networks and home robots. The sensor network architecture comprises of body worn sensors and ambient sensors distributed in the environment. We present the software architecture and conceptual design home robotic platform. We also perform preliminary characterization of the sensor network in terms of latencies and battery lifetime.}

New smart textile and clothing systems can be developed by integrating sensors in the textile constructions. Application fields for these added-value products are e.g. protective clothing for extreme environments, garments for the health care sector, technical textiles, sport and leisure wear. Some products have already been introduced on the markets, but generally it can be stated that the development is only in its starting phase, and the expectations for the future are big. Many different aspects have to be considered in the development of the wearable technology products for the health care sector: medical problems and their diagnosis, sensor choice, data processing and telecommunication solutions, clothing requirements. A functional product can be achieved only if all aspects work together, and therefore experts from all fields should participate in the RTD projects. In the EC-funded project DE3002 Easytex clothing and textiles for disabled and elderly people were investigated. Some recommendations concerning durability, appearance, comfort, service and safety of products for different special user groups were defined, based on user questionnaires and seminars, general textile and clothing requirements and on laboratory test series."Clothing Area Network--Clan" is a research project aiming to develop a technical concept and technology needed in enabling both wired and wireless data and power transfer between different intelligent modules (user interfaces, sensors, CPU's, batteries etc.) integrated into a smart clothing system. Fire-fighters clothing system is chosen as the development platform, being a very challenging application from which the developed technology can be transferred to other protective clothing systems.}

The MCT has been found to be the most frequently used in-vehicle technology and the main source of police in-vehicle distraction.METHOD: Twenty police officers participated in a driving simulator-based assessment of driving behavior, task completion time, and perceived workload with two MCT configurations under operational and tactical levels of driving.RESULTS: The findings revealed that using the MCT configuration with speech-based data entry and head-up display location while driving improved driving performance, decreased task completion time, and reduced police officers' workload as compared to the current MCT configuration used by police departments. Officers had better driving but worse secondary task performance under the operational driving as compared to the tactical driving condition.CONCLUSION: This study provided an empirical support for use of an enhanced MCT configuration in police vehicles to improve police officers' safety and performance. In addition, the findings emphasize the need for more training to improve officers' tactical driving skills and multitasking behavior.APPLICATION: The findings provide guidelines for vehicle manufacturers, MCT developers, and police agencies to improve the design and implementation of MCTs in police vehicles considering input modality and display eccentricity, which are expected to increase officer and civilian safety.}

 abstract     = {Exposure to extreme temperatures in workplaces implies serious physical hazards to workers. In addition, a poorly acclimatized worker can have reduced performance and alertness. It may therefore be more vulnerable to the risk of accidents and injuries. Due to the incompatibility of standards and regulations with some work environments and a lack of thermal exchange in many personal protective equipment, heat stress remains among the most common physical risks in many industrial sectors. Furthermore, conventional methods of measuring physiological parameters in order to calculate personal thermophysiological constraints are not practical to use during work tasks. However, the emergence of wearable technologies can contribute to real-time measurement of body temperature and the biometric signals needed to assess thermophysiological constraints while actively working. Thus, the present study was carried out in order to scrutinize the current knowledge of these types of technologies by analyzing the available systems and the advances made in previous studies, as well as to discuss the efforts required to develop devices for the prevention of the occurrence of heat stress in real time.}

However, the reliability and validity of the Stryd during walking on positive slopes using different backpack loads have never been investigated.RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the Stryd Power Meter reliable and valid for quantifying gait mechanics during walking on positive inclines and during level walking incorporating load carriage?METHODS: Seventeen participants from a police force rescue team performed 8 submaximal walking trials for 5-min at 3.6km{\textperiodcentered}h-1 during different positive slope (1{\%}, 10{\%} and 20{\%}) and backpack load (0{\%}, 10{\%}, 20{\%}, 30{\%} and 40{\%} of body mass) conditions. Two Stryd devices were utilized for reliability analyses. Validity of cadence and ground contact time (GCT) were analyzed against a gold standard device (Optojump).RESULTS: The Stryd demonstrated acceptable reliability [mean bias: <2.5{\%}; effect size (ES): <0.25; standard error of the mean: <1.7{\%}; r: >0.76] for power, cadence, and GCT. Validity measures (mean bias: <0.8{\%}; ES: <0.07; r: >0.96; Lin's Concordance Coefficient: 0.96; Mean Absolute Percent Error: <1{\%}) for cadence were also found to be acceptable. The Stryd overestimated (P<0.001; ES: >5.1) GCT in all the walking conditions. A significant systematic positive bias (P<0.022; r=0.56-0.76) was found in 7 conditions.SIGNIFICANCE: The Stryd Power Meter appears to produce reliable measurements for power output, cadence and GCT. The Stryd produced valid measurements for cadence during walking on positive slopes and during level walking with a loaded backpack. However, the Stryd is not valid for measuring GCT during these walking conditions. This study adds novel data regarding the reliability and validity of this device and might be of particular interest for scientists, practitioners, and first responders seeking reliable devices to quantify gait mechanics during walking.}

 abstract     = {A novel, fully-autonomous, wearable, wireless sensor network is presented, where each flexible textile node performs cooperative synchronous acquisition and distributed event detection. Computationally efficient situational-awareness algorithms are implemented on the low-power microcontroller present on each flexible node. The detected events are wirelessly transmitted to a base station, directly, as well as forwarded by other on-body nodes. For each node, a dual-polarized textile patch antenna serves as a platform for the flexible electronic circuitry. Therefore, the system is particularly suitable for comfortable and unobtrusive integration into garments. In the meantime, polarization diversity can be exploited to improve the reliability and energy-efficiency of the wireless transmission. Extensive experiments in realistic conditions have demonstrated that this new autonomous, body-centric, textile-antenna, wireless sensor network is able to correctly detect different operating conditions of a firefighter during an intervention. By relying on four network nodes integrated into the protective garment, this functionality is implemented locally, on the body, and in real time. In addition, the received sensor data are reliably transferred to a central access point at the command post, for more detailed and more comprehensive real-time visualization. This information provides coordinators and commanders with situational awareness of the entire rescue operation. A statistical analysis of measured on-body node-to-node, as well as off-body person-to-person channels is included, confirming the reliability of the communication system.}

To assess the incremental utilization and cost of asthma-related health services due to concomitant AR among asthmatic children.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asthma-related claims were extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) claims database, which covers 97{\%} of the population. Per-capita utilization and costs of asthma-related services were determined from the societal perspective.RESULTS: Of 319,714 children (1-14 years old) with chronic asthma in 2003, 195,026 had concomitant AR (prevalence 610 per 1,000 asthmatic children). Children with AR had 1.14 times more outpatient visits, 1.30 times more emergency department (ED) visits, and 1.49 times more hospitalizations than children without AR. More children with AR used general hospitals (7.17{\%}) than children without AR (3.23{\%}). The ratios of unit pharmaceutical costs per outpatient visit, ED visit, and admission between children with and without AR were 1.27, 1.20, and 1.14. Total annual expenditure combining direct health care, transportation, and caregivers' costs, were {\$}273 and {\$}217 for children with and without AR, respectively.CONCLUSION: Health service utilization and costs for asthma were greater for asthmatic children with AR. More frequent ED visits and admissions among asthmatic children with AR suggest poorer control and more frequent exacerbations. Higher unit cost of pharmaceuticals during visits, tendency to receive asthma care from a higher-level facility, and greater risk of ED visit or admission all contributed to the additional economic burden of AR.}

Out of 1 336 patients a total of 34 patients (2,5 {\%}) were transfused without any adverse events. Our demography is predominantly male and the most common mechanism of injury is trauma. Amongst the most common interventions were endotracheal intubation, thoracostomy and CPR. Preliminary analysis showed an increase in median systolic blood pressure and decrease in median heart rate after prehospital blood transfusion. Half of the patients that received CPR had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

The consistency rate was significantly higher in patients aged <40 years (95.5{\%} in ≤30 years and 90.9{\%} in 31-40 years) as compared to older patients (81.8{\%}, 68.2{\%}, and 72.7{\%} in 41-60 years, 61-80 years, and >80 years, respectively; P < 0.001 for each). The consistency rate was also higher for posteroanterior (PA) chest XR views than for anteroposterior (AP) chest XR views (72.7{\%} vs. 68.2{\%}, P = 0.005) and for high- and moderate-quality chest XR views than for poor-quality views (72.7{\%} and 77.3{\%} vs. 70.5{\%}, P = 0.001).Conclusion: The consistency between the chest XR and CT was more likely in patients aged <40 years and for PA and moderate-to-high quality chest XR views, as compared to older patients and AP and poor-quality views, respectively. We suggest that an upright position PA chest X-ray with high imaging quality may be the first choice, especially in patients aged <40 years admitted to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Prehospital rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is prone to suboptimal documentation. The Greater Sydney Area Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (GSA-HEMS) uses a dedicated Airway Registry (AR) to aid documentation. The AR was only evaluated shortly after its introduction. This first evaluation is followed up to assess the long-term effectiveness of the AR. The secondary objective was to compare the AR with templates in the literature.METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic records was undertaken to compare completeness of documentation between an immediate postintroduction and a long-term postintroduction cohort. Differences between the two cohorts were tested for significance.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in documentation for Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy grade at the first intubation attempt (P = .552) and confirmation of end-tidal carbon dioxide (P = .258). A significant improvement in the documentation of laryngoscopy grade for the second attempt (P = 0) was found. The documentation of intubator details remained at 100{\%} (165/165). The variables collected by GSA-HEMS corresponded well to the literature, but some definitions differ (eg, desaturation).CONCLUSION: There was no significant change in completeness of documentation for most key intubation variables eight years after the introduction of the AR. GSA-HEMS performs well in registering variables as proposed in the literature; however, variable definitions need to be synchronized.}

 abstract     = {Telehealth refers to the use of telecommunication technology to remove time and distance barriers in the delivery of healthcare services. Telehealth can help nurses provide education and counseling, social support, disease monitoring, and disease management reminders to cardiovascular patients in their homes. As a result, patients gain more flexibility in scheduling healthcare visits, have easier and more convenient access to healthcare, may have fewer time-demanding clinic visits, receive care in a location that does not require the burden of transportation, and in an environment that is less threatening than a clinic or emergency department. Cardiovascular healthcare may be enhanced through diverse telehealth applications, including sensor technology and wearable monitoring systems, Internet-based peripheral monitoring devices, videophones, interactive voice response systems, and nanotechnology. Although telehealth enhances care, legal, human, and environmental factors need to be considered before implementing a telehealth program. Additionally, more evidence that is obtained through large multicenter controlled trials about the potential benefits and cost effectiveness of telecardiovascular health is needed.}

 abstract     = {As a chronic disease, diabetes in the elderly patients is incurable and has a long treatment time, most of the symptoms are atypical, and onset is difficult to detect. This is among the challenging issues in front of doctors and paramedical stall and needed to be addressed on a priority basis as it poses a great threat to the health and life of the elderly. At present, the corresponding home medical products and emergency medical equipment cannot provide comprehensive and real-time services for monitoring physical conditions. At present, smart wearable health monitoring products are still in an emerging field. Relying on the advantages of internet technology, actively monitoring the physical condition of elderly diabetic patients is conducive to health protection. This article uses questionnaire surveys and experimental research methods to analyze the information source channels of the elderly diabetic patients interviewed for diabetes and their concerns about using smart wearable health monitoring products and compare their satisfaction with traditional blood glucose monitoring products and smart wearable health monitoring products. According to the investigation results of 50 elderly diabetes patients in P City,, they use TV, newspapers, and magazines to learn more about relevant information. They are mainly worried that they are unfamiliar with the product and will not use the process. Compared with traditional blood glucose monitoring products, smart wearable health monitoring products are satisfied, and degree is higher. Therefore, in order to better let elderly diabetic patients understand their physical condition, they can also effectively avoid the risk factors that may be suffered in life so that the disease can be effectively controlled. Various claims of the proposed scheme are verified through a rigorous evaluation process which is carried out in the form of numerous experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme is an effective way to resolve the aforementioned issue in the hospitals.}

These pharmacists serve culturally diverse American Indian populations throughout the United States and interface with tribal and federal programs to impact the opioid epidemic in Indian Country.PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Pharmacists have reduced barriers to care by expanding clinical practices to include novel approaches in pain management clinics and MAT programs.PRACTICE INNOVATION: As part of a multidisciplinary team, IHS pharmacists provide comprehensive patient care while focusing on the prevention of opioid dependence and opioid overdose death.EVALUATION: Pharmacists have also expanded professional competencies to include coprescribing naloxone and training first responders on naloxone use.RESULTS: Pharmacists within IHS have proactively completed advanced training on responsible opioid prescribing, augmented services to increase access to MAT for American Indians and Alaska Natives, and increased access to naloxone for opioid overdose reversal. Pharmacists have also developed a comprehensive training program and program measurement tools for law enforcement officers serving in tribal communities. These materials were used to train 350 officers in 6 districts and conduct a mass naloxone dispensing initiative across Indian Country. Pharmacists have consequently developed successful community coalitions that are focused on saving lives.CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist involvement in key initiatives including responsible opioid prescribing, expanded access to MAT, and expanded access to naloxone for trained first responders, coupled with an emphasis on enhanced education, illustrates pharmacists' impact with the opioid epidemic.}

 abstract     = {Cancer patients seeking emergency care can be vulnerable in increasingly overcrowded Emergency Departments and timely delivery of care is often aspirational rather than reality in many acute care systems. Ambulatory emergency care and its various international models are recognized as contributing to the safety and sustainability of emergency care services. This schema can logically be extended to the emergency oncology setting. The recent proliferation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to another opportunity for the management of oncologic complications in the ambulatory emergency care setting. More nuanced risk stratification of currently perceived high-risk toxicities may also afford the opportunity to personalize acute management. Virtual wards, which predominantly provide virtual monitoring only, and hospital at home services, which provide more comprehensive in-person assessment and interventions, may be well suited to supporting care for ICI toxicity alongside hospital-based assessment. Emergency management guidelines for immune-mediated toxicities will increasingly need to be both pragmatic and deliverable, especially as larger numbers of patients will present outside cancer centers. Identifying and modelling those suitable for emergency ambulatory care is integral to achieving this.}

Early recognition, diagnosis, and reperfusion are the key elements of treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The absence of a prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (P12ECG) can cause definitive treatment delay and repeated transfer. Although guidelines highly recommend the measurement and transmission of P12ECG data, P12ECG use has not been widely established.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to verify the time-efficiency and feasibility of the use of a patchy-type 12-lead ECG measuring and transmitting device (P-ECG) by an emergency medical technician (EMT) in an ambulance during patient transport.METHODS: This was a simulation-based prospective randomized crossover-controlled study that included EMTs. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A began the experiment with a conventional 12-lead ECG (C-ECG) device and then switched to the intervention device (P-ECG), whereas group B began the experiment with the P-ECG and then switched to the C-ECG. All simulations were performed inside an ambulance driving at 30 km/h. The time interval was measured from the beginning of ECG application to completion of sending the results. After the simulation, participants were administered the System Usability Scale questionnaire about usability of the P-ECG.RESULTS: A total of 18 EMTs were recruited for this study with a median age of 35 years. The overall interval time for the C-ECG was 254 seconds (IQR 247-270), whereas the overall interval time for the P-ECG was 130 seconds (IQR 112-150), with a significant difference (P<.001). Significant differences between the C-ECG and P-ECG were identified at all time intervals, in which the P-ECG device was significantly faster in all intervals, except for the preparation interval in which the C-ECG was faster (P=.03).CONCLUSIONS: Performance of 12-lead ECG examination and transmission of the results using P-ECG are faster than those of C-ECG during ambulance transport. With the additional time afforded, EMTs can provide more care to patients and transport patients more rapidly, which may help reduce the symptoms-to-balloon time for patients with acute coronary syndrome.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04114760; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04114760.}

Belton, the United States Supreme Court decided the subject about the recent criticism from scholars and Supreme Court Justices, alike, calling for the Court to re-examine its broad construction of the search incident to arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against warrantless searches and seizures in the vehicle-search context. The Court seized the opportunity to revisit Belton in Arizona v. Gant. While narrowing the scope of the search incident to arrest exception in some situations, the Gant holding extended its scope in others, perhaps straying from the principles of the Fourth Amendment.The current study was organized in the following manner: First, summarizes the case, including the facts, issue, holding, legal rule and reasoning; second, reviews the social realities that affect the ruling of the case; Finally, addresses the impact of the decision on law enforcement processes and/or social behavior. The present study relied on the several research paper and book, and media stories.The current study focused the review Arizona v. Gant, and the purpose of the present research is to provide an overview of the social realities that affect the case and the impact of the case on law enforcement processes. Prior to the Court's decision in Gant, Fourth Amendment jurisprudence was in a state of muddled, silent chaos. Supreme Court precedent had been stretched beyond its ``breaking point.'' In an effort to resolve unanswered questions surrounding the search incident to arrest exception the Court accepted Gant for review. By leaving the existing exceptions to the Fourth Amendment requirement intact, the Court did not handcuff law enforcement into overly stringent constraints. Instead, police officers have wide discretion in their creative selection of alternative exceptions in rationalizing further searches. Gant presented the Court with an opportunity to establish a ``bright-line'' rule in order to secure the safeguards of the Fourth Amendment and provide guidance to police for conducting searches incident to arrests.The study's review showed that the Supreme Court's decision in Gant cuts two ways: First, it returns to a narrow search incident to arrest exception for non-evidentiary crimes, although its wording might result in confused application of the rule by lower courts; Second, it reflects a continuing trend placing higher value on successful prosecution of suspected criminals than on the intent of the Fourth Amendment's framers. Implications for warrantless searches and seizures in the vehicle-search context are discussed.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Adequate training and preparation of medical first responders (MFRs) are essential for an optimal performance in highly demanding situations like disasters (e.g., mass accidents, natural catastrophes). The training needs to be as effective as possible, because precise and effective behavior of MFRs under stress is central for ensuring patients' survival and recovery. This systematic review offers an overview of scientifically evaluated training methods used to prepare MFRs for disasters. It identifies different effectiveness indicators and provides an additional analysis of how and to what extent the innovative training technologies virtual (VR) and mixed reality (MR) are included in disaster training research.METHODS: The systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and focused specifically on (quasi-)experimental studies published between January 2010 and September 2021. The literature search was conducted via Web of Science and PubMed and led to the inclusion of 55 articles.RESULTS: The search identified several types of training, including traditional (e.g., lectures, real-life scenario training) and technology-based training (e.g., computer-based learning, educational videos). Most trainings consisted of more than one method. The effectiveness of the trainings was mainly assessed through pre-post comparisons of knowledge tests or self-reported measures although some studies also used behavioral performance measures (e.g., triage accuracy). While all methods demonstrated effectiveness, the literature indicates that technology-based methods often lead to similar or greater training outcomes than traditional trainings. Currently, few studies systematically evaluated immersive VR and MR training.CONCLUSION: To determine the success of a training, proper and scientifically sound evaluation is necessary. Of the effectiveness indicators found, performance assessments in simulated scenarios are closest to the target behavior during real disasters. For valid yet inexpensive evaluations, objectively assessible performance measures, such as accuracy, time, and order of actions could be used. However, performance assessments have not been applied often. Furthermore, we found that technology-based training methods represent a promising approach to train many MFRs repeatedly and efficiently. These technologies offer great potential to supplement or partially replace traditional training. Further research is needed on those methods that have been underrepresented, especially serious gaming, immersive VR, and MR.}

 abstract     = {Monitoring the vital signs and physiological responses of the human body in daily activities is particularly useful for the early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we proposed a wireless and flexible biosensor patch for continuous and longitudinal monitoring of different physiological signals, including body temperature, blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiography. Moreover, these modalities for tracking body movement and GPS locations for emergency rescue have been included in biosensor devices. We optimized the flexible patch design with high mechanical stretchability and compatibility that can provide reliable and long-term attachment to the curved skin surface. Regarding smart healthcare applications, this research presents an Internet of Things-connected healthcare platform consisting of a smartphone application, website service, database server, and mobile gateway. The IoT platform has the potential to reduce the demand for medical resources and enhance the quality of healthcare services. To further address the advances in non-invasive continuous BP monitoring, an optimized deep learning architecture with one-channel electrocardiogram signals is introduced. The performance of the BP estimation model was verified using an independent dataset; this experimental result satisfied the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, and the British Hypertension Society standards for BP monitoring devices. The experimental results demonstrated the practical application of the wireless and flexible biosensor patch for continuous physiological signal monitoring with Internet of Medical Things-connected healthcare applications.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined differences in learning outcomes among newborn intensive care unit (NICU) workers who underwent virtual reality simulation (VRS) emergency evacuation training versus those who received web-based clinical updates (CU). Learning outcomes included a) knowledge gained, b) confidence with evacuation, and c) performance in a live evacuation exercise.METHODS: A longitudinal, mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was implemented utilizing a sample of NICU workers randomly assigned to VRS training or CUs. Four VRS scenarios were created that augmented neonate evacuation training materials. Learning was measured using cognitive assessments, self-efficacy questionnaire (baseline, 0, 4, 8, 12 months), and performance in a live drill (baseline, 12 months). Data were collected following training and analyzed using mixed model analysis. Focus groups captured VRS participant experiences.RESULTS: The VRS and CU groups did not statistically differ based upon the scores on the Cognitive Assessment or perceived self-efficacy. The virtual reality group performance in the live exercise was statistically (P{\&}lt;.0001) and clinically (effect size of 1.71) better than that of the CU group.CONCLUSIONS: Training using VRS is effective in promoting positive performance outcomes and should be included as a method for disaster training. VRS can allow an organization to train, test, and identify gaps in current emergency operation plans. In the unique case of disasters, which are low-volume and high-risk events, the participant can have access to an environment without endangering themselves or clients.

CT scan image interpretation reports recorded in the hospital automation system were considered eligible to be included in the study. XR images were interpreted by an orthopedics and traumatology specialist. The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Kappa (kappa) coefficient of XR were calculated according to CT. Inter-rater agreement was graded according to kappa values.RESULTS: A total of 274 patients were included in the study. Fractures were identified in the XR images in 180 (66{\%}) patients and in the CT images in 196 (72{\%}) patients. Compared to CT, the Sn, Sp, PPV, NPV and kappa coefficient of XR were 89{\%}, 92{\%}, 97{\%}, 77{\%} and 0.764 respectively. Compared to CT, the highest sensitivity of XR was measured to detecting radius (Sn: 95{\%}, kappa: 0.896) and 5th metacarpal fractures (Sn: 77{\%}, kappa: 0.859), the lowest sensitivity of XR was calculated in detecting scaphoid, capitate, pisiform, trapezium hamate, and triquetrum fractures (Sn: 59-14{\%}, kappa: 0.619-0.240). The sensitivity and kappa coefficient of XR were calculated 54{\%} and 0.530 in the adjacent bone fracture, 83{\%} and 0.830 in joint dislocation, 75{\%} and 0.661 in the fractures extending to the joint space.CONCLUSIONS: XR is the first-choice imaging modality in the evaluation of wrist injuries, but CT imaging should be preferred when fractures extending to the joint space, adjacent bone fracture and carpal bone fracture are being considered.}

 abstract     = {This paper proposes an emergency Traffic Adaptive MAC (eTA-MAC) protocol for WBANs based on Prioritization. The main advantage of the protocol is to provide traffic ranking through a Traffic Class Prioritization-based slotted-Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (TCP-CSMA/CA) scheme. The emergency traffic is handled through Emergency Traffic Class Provisioning-based slotted-CSMA/CA (ETCP-CSMA/CA) scheme. The emergency-based traffic adaptivity is provided through Emergency-based Traffic Adaptive slotted-CSMA/CA (ETA-CSMA/CA) scheme. The TCP-CSMA/CA scheme assigns a distinct, minimized and prioritized backoff period range to each traffic class in every backoff during channel access in Contention Access Period (CAP). The ETCP-CSMA/CA scheme delivers the sporadic emergency traffic that occurs at a single or multiple BMSN(s) instantaneously, with minimum delay and packet loss. It does this while being aware of normal traffic in the CAP. Then, the ETA-CSMA/CA scheme creates a balance between throughput and energy in the sporadic emergency situation with energy preservation of normal traffic BMSNs. The proposed protocol is evaluated using NS-2 simulator. The results indicate that the proposed protocol is better than the existing Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols by 86{\%} decrease in packet delivery delay, 61{\%} increase in throughput, and a 76{\%} decrease in energy consumption.}

Although past research on officer stress is informative, it is limited, and most studies measure stress using self-report questionnaires or observational studies that have limited generalizability. We know of no research studies that have attempted to track direct physiological stress responses in high fidelity, especially within an operational police setting. The outcome of this project will have an impact on both practitioners and policing researchers. To do so, we will establish a capacity to obtain complex, multisensor data; process complex datasets; and establish the methods needed to conduct idiopathic clinical trials on behavioral interventions in similar contexts.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study is to demonstrate the practicality and utility of wrist-worn biometric sensor-based research in a law enforcement agency.METHODS: We will use nonprobability convenience-based sampling to recruit 2-3 participants from the police department in Durham, North Carolina, USA.RESULTS: Data collection was conducted in 2016.

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: As a form of the Internet of Things (IoT)-gateways, a smart helmet is one of the core devices that offers distinct functionalities. The development of smart helmets connected to IoT infrastructure helps promote connected health and safety in various fields. In this regard, we present a comprehensive analysis of smart helmet technology and its main characteristics and applications for health and safety.OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the trends in smart helmet technology and provides an overview of the current and future potential deployments of such technology, the development of smart helmets for continuous monitoring of the health status of users, and the surrounding environmental conditions. The research questions were as follows: What are the main purposes and domains of smart helmets for health and safety? How have researchers realized key features and with what types of sensors?METHODS: We selected studies cited in electronic databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO on smart helmets through a keyword search from January 2010 to December 2021. In total, 1268 papers were identified (Web of Science: 87/1268, 6.86{\%}; EBSCO: 149/1268, 11.75{\%}; ScienceDirect: 248/1268, 19.55{\%}; and Google Scholar: 784/1268, 61.82{\%}), and the number of final studies included after PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) study selection was 57. We also performed a self-assessment of the reviewed articles to determine the quality of the paper. The scoring was based on five criteria: test environment, prototype quality, feasibility test, sensor calibration, and versatility.RESULTS: Smart helmet research has been considered in industry, sports, first responder, and health tracking scenarios for health and safety purposes. Among 57 studies, most studies with prototype development were industrial applications (18/57, 32{\%}), and the 2 most frequent studies including simulation were industry (23/57, 40{\%}) and sports (23/57, 40{\%}) applications. From our assessment-scoring result, studies tended to focus on sensor calibration results (2.3 out of 3), while the lowest part was a feasibility test (1.6 out of 3). Further classification of the purpose of smart helmets yielded 4 major categories, including activity, physiological and environmental (hazard) risk sensing, as well as risk event alerting.CONCLUSIONS: A summary of existing smart helmet systems is presented with a review of the sensor features used in the prototyping demonstrations. Overall, we aimed to explore new possibilities by examining the latest research, sensor technologies, and application platform perspectives for smart helmets as promising wearable devices. The barriers to users, challenges in the development of smart helmets, and future opportunities for health and safety applications are also discussed. In conclusion, this paper presents the current status of smart helmet technology, main issues, and prospects for future smart helmet with the objective of making the smart helmet concept a reality.}

Recently, elamipretide has been tested as a potential first disease-modifying drug. This study aimed to identify patients with BTHS who may respond to elamipretide, based on continuous physiological measurements acquired through wearable devices.RESULTS: Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 12 patients with BTHS were used, including physiological time series data measured using a wearable device (heart rate, respiratory rate, activity, and posture) and functional scores. The latter included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue score, SWAY Balance Mobile Application score (SWAY balance score), BTHS Symptom Assessment (BTHS-SA) Total Fatigue score, muscle strength by handheld dynamometry, 5 times sit-and-stand test (5XSST), and monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin ratio (MLCL:CL). Groups were created through median split of the functional scores into "highest score" and "lowest score", and "best response to elamipretide" and "worst response to elamipretide". Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) models were implemented to assess whether physiological data could classify patients according to functional status and distinguish non-responders from responders to elamipretide. AHC models clustered patients according to their functional status with accuracies of 60-93{\%}, with the greatest accuracies for 6MWT (93{\%}), PROMIS (87{\%}), and SWAY balance score (80{\%}). Another set of AHC models clustered patients with respect to their response to treatment with elamipretide with perfect accuracy (all 100{\%}).CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that continuously acquired physiological measurements from wearable devices can be used to predict functional status and response to treatment among patients with BTHS.}

 abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently attracted much interest in the research community because of their wide range of applications. An emerging application for WSNs involves their use in healthcare where they are generally termed wireless medical sensor networks. In a hospital, outfitting every patient with tiny, wearable, wireless vital sign sensors would allow doctors, nurses, and other caregivers to continuously monitor the state of their patients. In such a scenario, patients are expected to be treated in reasonable time, so an access control model is needed, which will provide both real-time access to comprehensive medical records and detect unauthorized access to sensitive data. In emergency situations, a doctor or nurse needs to access data immediately. The loss in data availability can result in further decline in the patient's condition or can even lead to death. Therefore, the availability of data is more important than any security concern in emergency situations. To address that research issue for medical data in WSNs, we propose the break-the-glass access control (BTG-AC) model that is a modified and redesigned version of the break-the-glass role-based access control (BTG-RBAC) model to address data availability issue and to detect the security policy violations from both authorized and unauthorized users. Several changes within the access control engine are made in BTG-RBAC in order to make the new BTG-AC to apply and fit in WSNs. This paper presents the detailed design and development of the BTG-AC model based on a healthcare scenario. The evaluation results show that the concepts of BTG, prevention and detection mechanism, and obligation provide more flexible access than other current access control models in WSNs. Additionally, we compare the BTG-AC model with an adaptive access control (A2C) model, which has similar properties, for further evaluation. Alongside with the comparison, the advantages and disadvantages of BTG-AC over current WSN access control models are presented.}

The purpose of this study is to test sociometers in a smart environment in a live clinical setting, to assess their reliability in capturing and quantifying data. The long-term goal of this work is to create an intelligent emergency department that captures real-time human interactions using sociometers to sense current system dynamics, predict future state, and continuously learn to enable the highest levels of emergency care delivery. Ten actors wore the devices during five simulated scenarios in the emergency care wards at a large non-profit medical institution. For each scenario, actors recited prewritten or structured dialogue while independent variables, e.g., distance, angle, obstructions, speech behavior, were independently controlled. Data streams from the sociometers were compared to gold standard video and audio data captured by two ward and hallway cameras. Sociometers distinguished body movement differences in mean angular velocity between individuals sitting, standing, walking intermittently, and walking continuously. Face-to-face (F2F) interactions were not detected when individuals were offset by 30{\textdegree}, 60{\textdegree}, and 180{\textdegree} angles. Under ideal F2F conditions, interactions were detected 50 {\%} of the time (4/8 actor pairs). Proximity between individuals was detected for 13/15 actor pairs. Devices underestimated the mean duration of speech by 30-44 s, but were effective at distinguishing the dominant speaker. The results inform engineers to refine sociometers and provide health system researchers a tool for quantifying the dynamics and behaviors in complex and unpredictable healthcare environments such as emergency care.}

Theseassigned tasks require excessive force and often occur in uncomfortable situations. In somecases, tasks are performed in undesirably high or low temperature environments. Some workerssuch as emergency call operator retain a static position for long working hours. In addition, theboundaries of fire protection tasks in Korea have extended to include emergency managementsince 1999, exposing firefighters to the greater risks of WMSDs.

In Korea, 2007, it was reported out of 30,630 firefighters,279 were involved in work-related accident or injury. Even though there was no exact informationreported on WMSDs, it must be acknowledged that during performing fire protection tasks,injuries including low back pain, sprain, strain, and more easily occurs. Also when treating theinjured fire prevention related workers, its work-relatedness must be considered, becauseprevention will become a reality only if work-relatedness is fully understood.

 abstract     = {Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a once-a-month injectable formulation that is Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients able to abstain from alcohol before treatment initiation. This paper presents the results of an analysis of efficacy data from a subgroup of patients with 4 days or more of voluntary abstinence before treatment initiation (n = 82) on a wide range of drinking-related outcomes. In these patients, all of whom received counseling, the rate of abstinence was severalfold higher for XR-NTX 380 mg compared with placebo: median time to first drink was 41 days versus 12 days, respectively; rate of continuous abstinence at end of the study was 32{\%} versus 11{\%} (P = 0.02). Extended-release naltrexone 380 mg, compared with placebo, substantially increased time to first heavy drinking event (>180 days vs 20 days; P = 0.04) and decreased the median number of any drinking days per month by 90{\%} (0.7 vs 7.2; P = 0.005) and heavy drinking days per month by 93{\%} (0.2 days vs 2.9 days; P = 0.007). The XR-NTX 380 mg group also had more than twice as many responders compared with placebo (70{\%} vs 30{\%}; P = 0.006; responder defined as having no more than 2 heavy drinking days in any consecutive 28-day period) and experienced greater improvement in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels (P = 0.03). Outcomes for XR-NTX 190 mg (n = 26) were generally intermediate, demonstrating a dose-response effect. In conclusion, XR-NTX 380 mg prolonged abstinence and reduced the number of heavy drinking days and drinking days in patients who were abstinent for as few as 4 days before treatment initiation.}

 abstract     = {The number of patients seeking help in emergency departments is steadily increasing. In part, this is due to patients who have acute symptoms, but do not require emergency care, as well as multimorbid patients needing complex medical care. Emergency departments serve as an interface between primary care and in-patient as well as out-patient care. The ongoing public discussion about the need to readjust emergency care structures in Germany does not adequately address this aspect. The knowledge of characteristics and needs of patients seeking help in emergency departments is insufficient. In order to develop interventions matching these needs it is necessary to gain deeper insight into these characteristics and needs. EMANet is a health services research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Its aim is to collect representative data on the course of medical care of emergency patients with ambulatory care sensitive conditions in all eight emergency departments in Mitte, the inner city district of Berlin. The EMANet project focuses on three patient groups: a) patients with cardiac symptoms and possible psychiatric comorbidities, b) ambulatory patients with acute or chronic diseases of the respiratory tract, and c) geriatric patients with hip fractures. The collected data shall be used to gain a better understanding of health care utilization patterns, patient-perceived satisfaction and risk factors for potentially avoidable medical conditions or worsening of chronic disease. The mixed methods design of EMANet includes quantitative data of 1,650 patients at two time points and corresponding secondary (i. e. routine) data from hospital information systems. In addition, qualitative interviews with patients and health care professionals shall reveal unmet needs for medical care. The results will give us more in-depth insight into the perceived current capacity overload and help implement structural changes in the health care system.}

Given that children are involved in most mass casualty events and there are deficiencies in the day-to-day emergency care of children, this project was undertaken to document the preparedness of hospitals in AR for the care of children in mass casualty or disaster situations.DESIGN: Mailed survey to all emergency department medical directors in AR. Nonresponders received a second mailed survey and an attempt at survey via phone.PARTICIPANTS: Medical directors of the emergency departments of the 80 acute care hospitals in AR.RESULTS: Seventy-two of 80 directors responded (90 percent response rate). Only 13 percent of hospitals reported they have pediatric mass casualty protocols and in only 28 percent of hospitals the disaster plan includes pediatric-specific issues such as parental reunification. Most hospitals hold mass casualty training events (94 percent), at least annually, but only 64 percent report including pediatric patients in their disaster drills. Most hospitals include local fire (90 percent), police (82 percent), and emergency medical services (77 percent) in their drills, but only 23 percent report involving local schools in the disaster planning process. Eighty-three percent of hospitals responding reported their staff is trained in decontamination procedures. Thirty-five percent reported having warm water showers available for infant/children decontamination. Ninety-four percent of hospitals have a plan for calling in extra staff in a disaster situation, which most commonly involves a phone tree (43 percent). Ninety-three percent reported the availability of Ham Radios, walkie-talkie, or Arkansas Wireless Information Network (AWIN) units for communication in case of land line loss, but only 16 percent reported satellite phone or Tandberg units. Twelve percent reported reliance on cell phones in this situation.CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrated important deficiencies in the preparedness of hospitals in AR for the care of children in disaster. Although many hospitals are relatively well prepared for the care of adults in disaster situations, the needs of children are different and hospitals in AR are not as well prepared for pediatric disaster care.}

 abstract     = {Assessment of mental workload is crucial for applications that require sustained attention and where conditions such as mental fatigue and drowsiness must be avoided. Previous work that attempted to devise objective methods to model mental workload were mainly based on neurological or physiological data collected when the participants performed tasks that did not involve physical activity. While such models may be useful for scenarios that involve static operators, they may not apply in real-world situations where operators are performing tasks under varying levels of physical activity, such as those faced by first responders, firefighters, and police officers. Here, we describe WAUC, a multimodal database of mental Workload Assessment Under physical aCtivity. The study involved 48 participants who performed the NASA Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery II under three different activity level conditions. Physical activity was manipulated by changing the speed of a stationary bike or a treadmill. During data collection, six neural and physiological modalities were recorded, namely: electroencephalography, electrocardiography, breathing rate, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and blood volume pulse, in addition to 3-axis accelerometry. Moreover, participants were asked to answer the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire after each experimental section, as well as rate their physical fatigue level on the Borg fatigue scale. In order to bring our experimental setup closer to real-world situations, all signals were monitored using wearable, off-the-shelf devices. In this paper, we describe the adopted experimental protocol, as well as validate the subjective, neural, and physiological data collected. The WAUC database, including the raw data and features, subjective ratings, and scripts to reproduce the experiments reported herein will be made available at: http://musaelab.ca/resources/.}

 abstract     = {Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.}

This achieves interactive peg rehabilitation by sharing muscle activities among patients and therapists. Through the performance study, it was shown that 1) applied EMS and measured wrist joint stiffness, and 2) produced wrist joint stiffness and measured EMG value has a linear correlation, which allows designing a mapping function between the measured EMG value on one person and the EMS value applied to another person. In a perceptual study, which shared the wrist stiffness between two persons, participants were able to recognize the level of their confederate's wrist joint stiffness using a 4-point Likert scale linearly. The developed system would benefit a physical therapist and a patient for sharing their wrist stiffness and grip force, which are usually difficult to be observed in a visual contact.}

 abstract     = {Driving under the influence of cannabis and alcohol represents a major safety concern due to the synergistic or additive effect of these substances of abuse. Hence, rapid road-site testing of these substances is highly desired to reduce risks of fatal accidents. Here we describe a wearable electrochemical sensing device for the simultaneous direct, decentralized, detection of salivary THC and alcohol. The new ring-based sensing platform contains a voltammetric THC sensor and an amperometric alcohol biosensor on the ring cap, along with the wireless electronics embedded within the ring case. Rapid replacement of the disposable sensing-electrode ring cap following each saliva assay is accomplished by aligning spring-loaded pins, mounted on the electronic board (PCB), with the current collectors of the sensing electrodes. The printed dual-analyte sensor ring cover is based on a MWCNT/carbon electrode for the THC detection along with a Prussian-blue transducer, coated with alcohol oxidase/chitosan reagent layer, for the biosensing of alcohol. THC and alcohol can thus be detected simultaneously in the same diluted saliva sample within 3min, with no cross talk and no interferences from the saliva matrix. The new wearable ring sensor platform should enable law enforcement personnel to screen drivers in a single traffic stop and offers considerable promise for addressing growing concerns of drug-impaired driving.}

We previously validated Fitbit Charge 2TM against home polysomnography and now evaluated the potential of this device to document differences in rest-activity behavior, including sleep macrostructure, in first-responder shift workers in an operational setting. We continuously monitored 89 individuals (54{\%} females; mean age: 33.9{\textpm} 7.7years) for 32.5{\textpm}9.3days and collected 2,974 individual sleep episodes scattered around the clock. We stratified the study participants according to their self-reported circadian preference on the reduced Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Evening Questionnaire (rMEQ; the scores from 4 participants were missing). Fitbit estimates of sleep duration, wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), REM sleep percentage in the first NREM-REM sleep cycle, and REM sleep latency formed approximately sinusoidal oscillations across 24hours. Generalized additive mixed model analyses revealed that the phase position of sleep duration minimum was delayed by 2.8h in evening types (ET; rMEQ ≤ 11; n =20) and by 2.6h in intermediate types (IT; 11 <rMEQ < 18; n =45) when compared to morning types (MT; rMEQ ≥ 18; n =20). Similarly, the phase position of WASO was delayed by 2.7h in ET compared to MT. While nocturnal sleep duration did not differ among the three groups, sleep episodes during the biological day decreased in duration from ET to IT to MT. Together, the findings support the notion that a consumer-grade, rest-activity tracker allows estimation of behavioral sleep/wake cycles and sleep macrostructure in shift workers under naturalistic conditions that are consistent with their self-reported chronotype.}

This system measures the physiological signals such as ECG(electrocardiogram), temperature, and motion data, analyzes those data automatically, and sends the urgent message to the Emergency Medical Center and to their family. There are two main parts in the system. In the first part, physiological data acquisition part, the troublesome addition and deletion of body signals on existing proposed systems have been supplemented, which led to the modulized production by means of ECG sensor module, temperature sensor module, acceleration sensor module. The other part is mobile unit, which includes signal processing and transmission functions. And bluetooth allows two parts to communicate with each other. Data that are processed in the mobile unit are stored in the PC database through the WLAN using TCP/IP protocol.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Completing an emergency medicine (EM) away rotation is integral to matching successfully into an EM residency program. The demand for EM away rotations (ARs) drives students to submit numerous applications without evidence-based recommendations to guide stakeholders on the approach or number to submit.OBJECTIVES: We conducted a survey study of EM-bound fourth-year medical students to gain insight into their AR application experiences, outcomes, and perceptions.METHODS: We distributed a 40-item questionnaire to EM applicants in Fall 2018 via e-mail through the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine, Council of Residency Directors in EM, and Emergency Medicine Residents' Association listservs. Responses were evaluated using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Primary outcomes were the number of AR applications submitted and AR offers received by students. Secondary outcomes were students' self-assessment of their competitiveness, differences in AR application numbers by degree type, sources of student advising, and student perceptions of the AR application process.RESULTS: There were 253 respondents, consisting of 192 allopathic (MD) and 61 osteopathic (DO) medical students, who met the inclusion criteria, representing about 10{\%} of the applicant pool. On average, students submitted 13.97 applications (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 11.59-16.35), received 3.25 offers (95{\%} CI 3.01-3.49), and accepted 2.22 offers (95{\%} CI 2.08-2.36). DO candidates submitted twice as many applications as MD candidates while experiencing a similar rate of offers received. Peer influence (n=154, 61{\%}), peer online advising networks (n=83, 33{\%}), and self-assessment (n=114, 45{\%}) were the most often reported causes of increased applications; cost (n=104, 41{\%}) and geographic limitations (n=114, 45{\%}) were the most often reported causes of decreased applications. Open-response analysis revealed frustration with lack of standardization (n=44, 29.5{\%}), insufficient transparency on available positions (n=37, 24.8{\%}), limited communication (n=30, 20.1{\%}), and cost (n=12, 8.1{\%}).CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that, as a whole, students received one away rotation offer for every four to five applications submitted.

 abstract     = {In the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, the internet of things (IoT) will play a crucial role in collecting and analyzing information related to human healthcare, public safety, environmental monitoring and home/industrial automation. Even though conventional batteries are widely used to operate IoT devices as a power source, these batteries have a drawback of limited capacity, which impedes broad commercialization of the IoT. In this regard, piezoelectric energy harvesting technology has attracted a great deal of attention because piezoelectric materials can convert electricity from mechanical and vibrational movements in the ambient environment. In particular, piezoelectric-based flexible energy harvesters can precisely harvest tiny mechanical movements of muscles and internal organs from the human body to produce electricity. These inherent properties of flexible piezoelectric harvesters make it possible to eliminate conventional batteries for lifetime extension of implantable and wearable IoTs. This paper describes the progress of piezoelectric perovskite material-based flexible energy harvesters for self-powered IoT devices for biomedical/wearable electronics over the last decade.}

It represents an alternative to emergency medical services for outpatient populations with a temporary risk of sudden cardiac death. While the original devices used a monophasic truncated exponential waveform for cardioversion/defibrillation shocks, a new, biphasic shock was developed for the next device generation. In 12 patients undergoing electrophysiological testing for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, termination of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) was attempted via the WCD. In 22 episodes, induced VF was promptly terminated by the first 70 J (n=12) or 100 J (n=10) biphasic shocks. Time between arrhythmia initiation and shock delivery was 22 +/- 6 seconds (70 J) and 21 +/- 6 seconds (100 J) (P=NS). The measured transthoracic impedance was 71 +/- 5 Ohms (64-79 Ohms) for the 70 J shock and 64 +/- 8 Ohms (47-72 Ohms) for the 100 J shock. The present study demonstrates that a single low energy biphasic shock delivered by the WCD, reliably terminates electrically induced VF (100{\%} of episodes). The results of this study suggest that there is an acceptable safety margin to the maximum output of the device (150 J). Despite our promising data, we recommend that programming all shocks for maximum energy output should be done when using the WCD in ambulatory patients.}

Analyses were conducted for both all subjects and clinical responders. Direct costs associated with inpatient and outpatient mental healthcare-related services were obtained from a large, prospective, observational study of schizophrenia treatment in usual-care settings for relapsing and non-relapsing patients, including psychiatric hospitalizations, emergency services, medication management, and outpatient individual therapy. Model robustness was tested using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.RESULTS: Model-estimated PPPY MH cost savings associated with relapse-related hospitalization rates in all subjects were {\$}3276 for lurasidone vs quetiapine XR. Lurasidone resulted in PPPY MH cost savings of {\$}2702 vs quetiapine XR in all subjects, using relapse rates. Sensitivity analyses indicated lurasidone had lower 1-year MH costs than quetiapine XR in 100{\%} and 99.7{\%} of simulations, using relapse-related hospitalization rates and relapse rates, respectively, in all subjects. Similar results were seen in clinical responders.LIMITATIONS: The model represents a simplification of treatment patterns and response to treatment. Cost of treatment with lurasidone and quetiapine XR was not included in the model. Estimates of cost savings are likely conservative, as the model did not assess the impact of long-term cardiometabolic consequences. Indirect costs associated with relapses and non-mental health-related costs were also excluded from the model.CONCLUSION: Adults treated for schizophrenia with lurasidone are predicted to have lower 12-month MH costs compared to those treated with quetiapine XR due to fewer relapses and relapse-related hospitalizations.}

The new omnipresent medicine enabled by the Internet of things offers fascinating new possibilities. Additionally, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS), it is necessary to meet the rapidly increasing need for routine nursing and on-site diagnosis and prognosis. This article proposes a universal and preventive strategy to drug management based on intelligent and interactive packaging (I2Pack) and IMedBox. The controlled delamination material (CDM) seals and regulates wireless technologies in novel medicine packaging. As such, wearable biomedical sensors may capture a variety of crucial parameters via wireless communication. On-site treatment and prediction of these critical factors are made possible by high-performance architecture. The user interface is also highlighted to make surgery easier for the elderly, disabled, and patients. Land testing incorporates and validates an approach for prototyping I2Pack and iMedBox. Additionally, sustainability, increased product safety, and quality standards are crucial throughout the life sciences. To achieve these standards, intelligent packaging is also used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. These technologies will continuously monitor the quality of a product and communicate with the user. Data carriers, indications, and sensors are the three most important groups. They are not widely used at the moment, although their potential is well understood. Intelligent packaging should be used in these sectors and the functionality of the systems and the values presented in this analysis.}

For providing the service to firefighters in a variety of environments, in this research, we selected a low-cost IMU sensor and used acceleration and gyro. The PDR consists of walking distance and direction estimation processes; in the distance estimation process, the peak and zero crossing detection algorithms were used to detect the steps, and the walking distance was calculated using a fuzzy interface system. For estimating the correct direction, the roll and pitch drifts were eliminated by using an extended Kalman filter. In the process, we developed a yaw drift reduction algorithm that consists of two filters and devised three techniques with TKEO. The drift was modeled as a linear function and reduced with the three techniques, and the extra noises were eliminated by the filters. To compare the existing work, the heuristic drift reduction (HDR) was implemented. In the experiments, after each walk along 580 m and 234 m, the proposed algorithm reported position errors of 0.37{\%} and 0.29{\%}, which exceeded the 2.31{\%} and 6.14{\%} of the HDR.}

Also, products created after 2010, which was when the convergence of smart technologies and textile and fashion products were generalized, examined. As for study subjects, designs that support human activities and product designs that are utilized by ordinary consumers where selected, focusing on fiber fashion.In terms of theoretical examinations, first of all, this study defined the meaning of the words `smart technology', `sustainability', `design value', and `wellness'.Secondly, this study examined the current status of the smart textile and fashion industry. Thirdly, sustainable design was studies, mainly focusing on the direction of textile and fashion design and the flow of sustainable development.The cases of designs converging smart technologies and sustainable values where studied by categorizing them into environmental value creating design, social value creating design, economical value creating design, and wellness creating design. Cases of environmental value creating designs mostly showed designs to protect the environment through saving energy such as utilizing solar power in daily lives, and showed strengthening in eco-efficiency and maintaining sustainability through environmental protection. Social value creating designs showed designs for the socially weak, helping public profits by promoting the safety of fire fighters or the military, designs for industrial safety, etc. The characteristic of these designs is that they can be used to maximize public profits balanced development by achieving social responsibilities. As for economical value creating designs, they were shown to contribute in the qualitative growth of the fashion industry by enhancing work efficiency and saving time of businessmen. Wellness creating designs were displayed in different design forms including design that pursues a happy life by protecting individual health, design applied with smart technologies to support medical practice through medical clothing, and design that respects life by dealing with dangerous situations.The conclusion derived from the case study was that smart technologies enhance and the quality of human lives improve when the designers' values to protect sustainability are fulfilled. In terms of product design, designers should plan designs to cover the whole life cycle of the product and make an effort to create environmental, economical, social, and wellness values.}

Criteria for response (> or = 50{\%} improvement from baseline HAM-A score) and remission (HAM-A score < or = 7) and their temporal profile were used to characterize patient improvement over 6 months of treatment with venlafaxine XR and placebo.RESULTS: Venlafaxine XR was associated with significantly (P<0.001) higher response and remission rates (66 and 43{\%}, respectively) compared with placebo (39 and 19{\%}), regardless of the level of baseline anxiety. In the venlafaxine XR group, 61{\%} of the patients who had responded but not remitted by week 8 showed remission by the end of 6 months. In comparison, only 39{\%} of placebo responders who did not qualify for remission at the end of the first 8 weeks of therapy remitted by the end of the 6 months (P=0.007). Relapse occurred in 6{\%} of venlafaxine XR-treated patients and 15{\%} of placebo-treated patients (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: This analysis provides further insight into the outcome of long-term treatment of generalised anxiety disorder with venlafaxine XR and shows for the first time that long-term treatment might be necessary to achieve and maintain remission of symptoms.}

 abstract     = {With the medical model shifting from a single biomedical model to a biopsychological-social model, the impact of psychosocial factors on cancer patients has attracted attention. Studies have shown that chronic stress caused by long-term psychological stress, such as anxiety and depression, can promote the malignant progression of tumors by acting on beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR). beta2-AR can promote tumor migration by activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the underlying mechanisms in the regulation of EMT by beta2-AR are still unclear. In this study, we established a chronic stress model by treating MGC-803 and SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells with isoproterenol (ISO), a beta2-AR agonist. EMT in the two gastric cancer cell lines was enhanced after ISO treatment. Thereafter, we found that the interaction between beta2-AR and PlexinA1 was involved in the process by which chronic stress affects EMT in both MGC-803 and SGC-7901 cells. Moreover, the activation of beta2-AR by ISO increased the expression of PlexinA1, activated JAK-STAT3 signaling and further promoted EMT in human gastric cancer cells. Importantly, the knockdown of PlexinA1 by small hairpin RNAs inhibited JAK-STAT3 signaling and abolished the EMT induced by beta2-AR. In conclusion, PlexinA1 was an important downstream target of beta2-AR, through which beta2-AR promoted EMT in human gastric cancer cells by activating JAK-STAT3 signaling.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder affecting millions worldwide, and it results in many potential medical complications throughout the life course. The hallmark of SCD is pain. Many patients experience daily chronic pain as well as intermittent, unpredictable acute vaso-occlusive painful episodes called pain crises. These pain crises often require acute medical care through the day hospital or emergency department. Following presentation, a number of these patients are subsequently admitted with continued efforts of treatment focused on palliative pain control and hydration for management. Mitigating pain crises is challenging for both the patients and their providers, given the perceived unpredictability and subjective nature of pain.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to show the feasibility of using objective, physiologic measurements obtained from a wearable device during an acute pain crisis to predict patient-reported pain scores (in an app and to nursing staff) using machine learning techniques.METHODS: For this feasibility study, we enrolled 27 adult patients presenting to the day hospital with acute pain. At the beginning of pain treatment, each participant was given a wearable device (Microsoft Band 2) that collected physiologic measurements. Pain scores from our mobile app, Technology Resources to Understand Pain Assessment in Patients with Pain, and those obtained by nursing staff were both used with wearable signals to complete time stamp matching and feature extraction and selection. Following this, we constructed regression and classification machine learning algorithms to build between-subject pain prediction models.RESULTS: Patients were monitored for an average of 3.79 (SD 2.23) hours, with an average of 5826 (SD 2667) objective data values per patient. As expected, we found that pain scores and heart rate decreased for most patients during the course of their stay. Using the wearable sensor data and pain scores, we were able to create a regression model to predict subjective pain scores with a root mean square error of 1.430 and correlation between observations and predictions of 0.706. Furthermore, we verified the hypothesis that the regression model outperformed the classification model by comparing the performances of the support vector machines (SVM) and the SVM for regression.CONCLUSIONS: The Microsoft Band 2 allowed easy collection of objective, physiologic markers during an acute pain crisis in adults with SCD. Features can be extracted from these data signals and matched with pain scores. Machine learning models can then use these features to feasibly predict patient pain scores.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of a domain-specific ontology and machine learning-driven user interfaces on the efficiency and quality of documentation of presenting problems (chief complaints) in the emergency department (ED).METHODS: As part of a quality improvement project, we simultaneously implemented three interventions: a domain-specific ontology, contextual autocomplete, and top five suggestions. Contextual autocomplete is a user interface that ranks concepts by their predicted probability which helps nurses enter data about a patient's presenting problems. Nurses were also given a list of top five suggestions to choose from. These presenting problems were represented using a consensus ontology mapped to SNOMED CT. Predicted probabilities were calculated using a previously derived model based on triage vital signs and a brief free text note. We evaluated the percentage and quality of structured data captured using a mixed methods retrospective before-and-after study design.RESULTS: A total of 279,231 consecutive patient encounters were analyzed. Structured data capture improved from 26.2{\%} to 97.2{\%} (p < 0.0001). During the post-implementation period, presenting problems were more complete (3.35 vs 3.66; p = 0.0004) and higher in overall quality (3.38 vs. 3.72; p = 0.0002), but showed no difference in precision (3.59 vs. 3.74; p = 0.1). Our system reduced the mean number of keystrokes required to document a presenting problem from 11.6 to 0.6 (p < 0.0001), a 95{\%} improvement.DISCUSSION: We demonstrated a technique that captures structured data on nearly all patients. We estimate that our system reduces the number of man-hours required annually to type presenting problems at our institution from 92.5 h to 4.8 h.CONCLUSION: Implementation of a domain-specific ontology and machine learning-driven user interfaces resulted in improved structured data capture, ontology usage compliance, and data quality.}

There is currently no established standard test method to specifically evaluate the barrier performance of the glove-protective clothing interface region for any personal protective equipment ensemble.OBJECTIVE: This study quantifies the fluid leakage at the coverall and glove interface using single and double gloving.METHODS: A robotic arm, which can simulate upper extremity movements of health care personnel, was used to test 5 coverall models and an extended examination glove model in single and double glove conditions.RESULTS: The results show that there was a significant difference in fluid leakage amounts between some of the coverall models and the number of glove layers studied. Findings also highlight that there is a high correlation between basis weight and stiffness of the coverall fabrics and the fluid leakage amounts.CONCLUSIONS: These results underline that coverall constructed from thin and less stiff fabrics can result in lower fluid leakage levels. Also, there was no significant difference in fluid leakage amounts between single and double gloves when tested with each of the coverall models, with the exception of the coveralls with the highest basis weight and stiffness.}

For each patient, the following times were documented: ED arrival, ED departure, ED length of stay (LOS), imaging order entry, image availability, radiology report availability, triage note, ED provider note, and laboratory results.RESULTS: Mean age was 44.2, 66.5{\%} female, and mean ED LOS was 326.2min. ED LOS was longer for patients who received CT versus XR (343.9 vs. 311.3; p=0.029). In 25.5{\%} of XR, 10{\%} of CT, and 8{\%} of US cases, the imaging exam was completed before the ED provider note was started. In 20.5{\%} of XR, 6.5{\%} of CT, and 6{\%} of US cases, the radiologist did not have the ED provider note available prior to completing their diagnostic interpretation. In 33.4{\%} of all cases and 57.5{\%} of XR cases, incomplete clinical documentation (triage note, provider note, lab results) was available during radiology report creation. CT and US exams more frequently had clinical data available prior to radiologist interpretation than XR (p<0.0001). Radiologist turn-around-time was unaffected by clinical information availability.CONCLUSION: Eight percent of ED CT and 10{\%} of ED US examinations were ordered and completed before documented clinical assessment. Thirty-three percent had incomplete clinical assessment performed prior to image interpretation. Further investigation is needed to determine impact on interpretation accuracy.}

Seventeen gigahertz is proposed for next-generation WLAN services offering numerous advantages over traditional IEEE 802.11 networks that operate in the range of 2.4-5 GHz. Orthogonal polarization is often used to increase spectrum efficiency by utilizing signal paths of horizontal and vertical polarization. Radio waves exceeding 10 GHz are particularly vulnerable to signal degradation under the influence of rain which causes an effective reduction in isolation between polarized signal paths. This paper investigates the influence of heavy rain in a tropical region on wide-band microwave signals at 17 GHz using two links provided by a fixed broad-band wireless access system for two-way data exchange between paramedics attending an accident scene and the hospital via microwave equipment installed in the ambulance. We also study the effects of cross polarization and phase rotation due to persistent heavy rainfall in tropical regions.}

The aim of this study was to assess the usability of continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation device on post-COVID-19 patients.Method: The system consists of a digital continuous pulse oximeter and a smartphone with an App, which were provided to patients. A survey composed of a standard Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire, and a satisfaction questionnaire was exploited to conduct a usability and feasibility analysis of the service.Results: A total of 29 patients (17.2{\%} female) with a mean age of 65{\textpm}11.5 years were enrolled: 20 patients were smartphone users (69{\%}) with a mean age of 60.2{\textpm}9.5 years, and 9 patients (31{\%}) did not own a smartphone (mean age 76.8{\textpm}5.9). The monitoring period was 1 month: a total of 444 recordings were conducted, 15 recordings per patient averagely. In total, 82{\%} of the recordings performed did not require any intervention, while 18{\%} led to the production of a report and subsequent intervention by a nurse who verified, together with the specialist, the need to intervene (i.e. the patient accessed the clinic for medical control and/or modification of oxygen therapy). A total of 17 patients compiled a usability questionnaire. The service was perceived as useful and well-structured, although it often required caregiver support.Conclusions: Using continuous home-monitoring care with an oxygen saturation device seems feasible and useful for patients who could be followed at home avoiding going back to the hospital every time a trend oximetry is needed. Further improvements in connections, data flow processes, and simplifications, based on patients' feedback, are needed to scale up the service.}

We evaluated the usability of the Massachusetts (MA) PDMP by emergency medicine providers (EPs), as a system's usability may affect how often it is used.METHODS: This was a mixed-methods study of 17 EPs. We compared the time and number of clicks required to review one patient's record in the PDMP to three other commonly performed computer-based tasks in the emergency department (ED: ordering a computed tomography [CT] scan, writing a prescription, and searching a medication history service integrated within the electronic medical record [EMR]). We performed semistructured interviews and analyzed participant comments and responses regarding their experience using the MA PDMP.RESULTS: The PDMP task took a longer time to complete (mean = 4.22 minutes) and greater number of mouse clicks to complete (mean = 50.3 clicks) than the three other tasks (CT-pulmonary embolism = 1.42 minutes, 24.8 clicks; prescription = 1.30 minutes, 19.5 clicks; SureScripts = 1.45 minutes, 9.5 clicks). Qualitative analysis yielded four main themes about PDMP usability, three negative and one positive: 1) difficulty accessing the PDMP, 2) cumbersome acquiring patient medication history information within the PDMP, 3) nonintuitive display of patient medication history information within the PDMP, and 4) overall perceived value of the PDMP despite an inefficient interface.CONCLUSIONS: The complicated processes of gaining access to, logging in, and using the MA PDMP are barriers to preventing its more frequent use. All states should evaluate the PDMP usability in multiple practice settings including the ED and work to improve provider enrollment, login procedures, patient information input, prescription data display, and ultimately, PDMP data integration into EMRs.}

Results: TUQ item scores rating the model system were highest for usefulness and satisfaction, and lowest for interaction quality and reliability. Conclusions: We found high model acceptance, but desire for a simpler, more reliable technology interface with better audiovisual quality for low-frequency, high-stakes use. Future work will emphasize technology interface quality and reliability, automate coordinator roles, and field test the model system.}

Every year, about 610,000 people die of heart attack in the United States alone-that is one in every four deaths-but there are well understood early symptoms of heart attack that could be used to greatly help in saving many lives and minimizing damages by detecting and reporting at an early stage. On the other hand, every year, about 2.35 million people get injured or disabled from road accidents. Unexpectedly, many of these fatal accidents happen due to the heart attack of drivers that leads to the loss of control of the vehicle. The current work proposes the development of a wearable system for real-time detection and warning of heart attacks in drivers, which could be enormously helpful in reducing road accidents. The system consists of two subsystems that communicate wirelessly using Bluetooth technology, namely, a wearable sensor subsystem and an intelligent heart attack detection and warning subsystem. The sensor subsystem records the electrical activity of the heart from the chest area to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) trace and send that to the other portable decision-making subsystem where the symptoms of heart attack are detected. We evaluated the performance of dry electrodes and different electrode configurations and measured overall power consumption of the system. Linear classification and several machine algorithms were trained and tested for real-time application. It was observed that the linear classification algorithm was not able to detect heart attack in noisy data, whereas the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with polynomial kernel with extended time-frequency features using extended modified B-distribution (EMBD) showed highest accuracy and was able to detect 97.4{\%} and 96.3{\%} of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), respectively. The proposed system can therefore help in reducing the loss of lives from the growing number of road accidents all over the world.}

We use components of Implementation Facilitation to enhance adoption of ED-initiated buprenorphine (BUP) at approximately 30 sites. Subsequently we compare the effectiveness of two BUP formulations, sublingual (SL-BUP) and 7-day extended-release injectable (CAM2038, XR-BUP) in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of approximately 2000 patients with OUD on the primary outcome of engagement in formal addiction treatment at 7days. Secondary outcomes assessed at 7 and 30days include self-reported opioid use, craving and satisfaction, health service utilization, overdose events, and engagement in formal addiction treatment (30days) and receipt of medications for OUD (at 7 and 30days). A sample size of 1000 per group provides 90{\%} power at the 2-sided significance level to detect a difference in the primary outcome of 8{\%} and accommodates a 15{\%} dropout rate. We will compare the cost effectiveness of the two treatments on the primary outcome using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We will also conduct an ancillary study in approximately 75 patients experiencing minimal to no opioid withdrawal who will undergo XR-BUP initiation. If the ancillary study demonstrates safety, we will expand the eligibility criteria for the RCT to include individuals with minimal to no opioid withdrawal. The results of these studies will inform implementation of ED-initiated BUP in diverse EDs which has the potential to improve treatment access.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) represents a huge financial and economic burden worldwide. Some authors advocate that remote monitoring should be implemented to improve HF management, but given its increasing incidence, as well as its morbidity and mortality, a question still remains: are we monitoring it properly? There is no shortage of literature on home monitoring devices, however, most of them are designed to monitor an unsuitable array of variables and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no large randomized studies about their impact on morbidity/mortality of HF patients.OBJECTIVE: Description of a novel monitoring device.METHODS: As a solution, we designed MONITORIA (MOnitoring NonInvasively To Overcome mortality Rates of heart Insufficiency on Ambulatory).RESULTS: This is a multimodal device that will provide real time monitoring of vital, electrophysiological, hemodynamic and chemical signs, transthoracic impedance, and physical activity levels. The device is meant to perform continuous analysis and transmission of all data. Significant alterations in a patient's variable will alert the attending physician and, in case of potentially life-threatening situations, the national emergency medical system. The MONITORIA device will, also, have a function that sends shocks or functions as a pacemaker to treat certain arrhythmias/blockades. This function can be activated the very first time the patient utilizes it, based on their risk of sudden cardiac death.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: MONITORIA is a promising device mostly because it is included in a follow-up program that takes into account a multi-perspective feature of HF development and is based on the real world patient, adapting innovations not to the disease but rather to the patients.}

In addition, relatively little research has been conducted on automatic speech recognition performance with older adults, in whom speech disorders are commonly present. As one ages, the older adult voice naturally begins to resemble some aspects of mildly dysarthric speech. Dysarthria, a common neuromotor speech disorder, is particularly useful for exploring performance limitations of automatic speech recognizers owing to its wide range of speech expression. This article reviews clinical research literature examining the use of commercial speech-to-text automatic speech recognition technology by individuals with dysarthria. The main factors limiting automatic speech recognition performance with dysarthric speakers are highlighted and extended to the elderly using a specific example of a novel, automated, speech-based personal emergency response system for older adults.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: This article describes the evolution of first aid in the British Army from the Crimean War to the present day in order to interpret the processes of innovation, implementation, and diffusion of ideas to improve the clinical outcomes for military casualties.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The article is an analysis of policy and practice for training in first aid published in King's/Queen's Regulations for the Army, the Field Service Pocket Book, or generic military training policy. This is complimented by a review of medical training manuals and a search of articles in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). Most sources have been accessed from the Museum of Military of Medicine and the Wellcome RAMC Muniments Collection.RESULTS: The narrative summarizes the evolution of clinical concepts in first aid and their translation for Army personnel; starting with RAMC stretcher bearers, extended to soldiers assigned to medical duties at unit level, and finally simplified into first aid training to be taught to all soldiers. Alongside this story of training is a secondary story of the development of field first aid equipment, principally dressings, tourniquets, and analgesia. The final part of the story is the transfer of knowledge from military first aid training into the civilian, community setting. The following themes were identified: the reality of conflict wounds, battlefield first aid is different from civilian first aid, progressive transfer of training from medics to soldiers, transfer of knowledge to civilian sector and internationally, and specific clinical innovations: first field dressings, tourniquets, and prehospital analgesia.DISCUSSION: The current generation of soldiers are at the highest ever standard of first aid training and equipment. This must be maintained through gathering of evidence in effectiveness and outcomes in prehospital emergency care in both military and civilian settings.}

RNA extraction, RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, BrdU incorporation assays, flow cytometry and other experimental technics were also used in present work.RESULTS: Decreased expression of epithelial markers (Cytokeratin 8, NKX3.1 and E-cadherin) and increased expression of mesenchymal markers (alpha-SMA, Vimentin, and N-cadherin) in were found in AR knockout TRAMP tumors. Further investigation indicated that AR signal deprivation is associated with cell morphology transition, high cell mobility, high cell invasion rate and resistance to anoikis in TRAMP prostate tumor cells. Together, these findings implied knockout AR in TRAMP prostate tumor may lead to EMT, which may result in earlier metastasis, and then cause TRAMP mice die earlier. TGF-beta1 is responsible for EMT in AR knockout TRAMP tumor cells.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, ADT therapy induced hormone refractory prostate cancer may gain the ability of metastasis through cell's EMT which is a phase of poor differentiation. Anti-EMT drugs should be developed to battle the tumor metastasis induced by ADT therapy.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Inadequately controlled allergic rhinitis (AR) in asthmatic patients can contribute towards increased asthma exacerbations and poorer symptom control, which may increase medical resource use. We assessed asthma-related medical resource use and attacks in asthmatic patients who did and did not have concomitant AR and were adding montelukast or salmeterol to baseline treatment with inhaled fluticasone.METHODS: A post hoc resource use analysis of a 52-week, double-blind multicentre clinical trial (Investigation of Montelukast as a Partner Agent for Complementary Therapy) [corrected] including 1490 adults with chronic asthma, aged 15-72 years, with FEV(1) 50-90{\%} of predicted and > or =12{\%} increase in FEV(1) after salbutamol administration, treated with either montelukast 10 mg daily or salmeterol 50 microg twice daily in addition to fluticasone 200 microg, was undertaken. Asthma-related medical resource use included medical visits (defined as either an unscheduled visit [to a general practitioner, a specialist or a non-medical provider] or a specialist visit), emergency room visits and hospitalizations during follow-up. Asthma attacks were defined as the worsening of asthma requiring unscheduled visit, emergency visit, hospitalization or oral/intravenous/intramuscular corticosteroids.RESULTS: A self-reported history of concomitant AR was identified in 60{\%} of the patients (n=893). Univariate analysis suggests that significantly more patients with concomitant AR experienced emergency room visits (3.6{\%} vs. 1.7{\%}, P=0.029) and asthma attacks (21.3{\%} vs. 17.1{\%}, P=0.046). Multivariate analysis adjusting for treatment group, age and baseline asthma severity confirmed these results since the presence of concomitant AR in patients with asthma increases the likelihood of emergency room visit (odds ratio (OR)=2.35, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.12-4.80) and asthma attack (OR=1.35, 95{\%} CI=1.03-1.77). Patients with asthma alone compared with patients with both conditions did not differ in terms of unscheduled or specialist visits and hospitalizations.CONCLUSIONS: Presence of self-reported concomitant AR in patients with asthma resulted in a higher rate of asthma attacks and more emergency room visits compared with asthma patients without concomitant AR.}

Previous systems have used speech-based interfaces.METHOD: Participants (108 undergraduates) navigated three maps, guided by one of three beacons (pink noise, sonar ping, or 1000-Hz pure tone) spatialized by a virtual reality engine. Dependent measures were efficiency of time and path length.RESULTS: Overall navigation was very successful, with significant effects of practice and capture radius, and interactions with beacon sound. Overshooting and subsequent hunting for waypoints was exacerbated for small radius conditions. A human-scale capture radius (1.5 m) and sonar-like beacon yielded the optimal combination for safety and efficiency.CONCLUSION: The selection of beacon sound and capture radius depend on the specific application, including whether speed of travel or adherence to path are of primary concern. Extended use affects sound preferences and quickly leads to improvements in both speed and accuracy.APPLICATION: These findings should lead to improved wayfinding systems for the visually impaired as well as for first responders (e.g., firefighters) and soldiers.}

Exosomal long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) derived from macrophages play a major role in transmitting biological information, whereas related studies on DN are rare. Here we investigated the effects of exosomal lncRNAs from high glucose-treated macrophages on EMT.METHODS: High glucose-treated macrophage exosomes (HG-exos) were extracted by coprecipitation and stabilized. Then, mouse renal tubular epithelial cells were treated with HG-exos for 24h. Expression of E-cadherin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and fibronectin was detected by western blotting, qPCR, and immunofluorescence. High-throughput sequencing was then applied to analyze the bioinformatics of HG-exos.RESULTS: HG-exos inhibited the proliferation of tubular epithelial cells. Additionally, HG-exos markedly upregulated alpha-SMA and fibronectin expression and downregulated E-cadherin expression in tubular epithelial cells, indicating EMT induction. A total of 378 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 674 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified by high-throughput sequencing of HG-exos. Bioinformatics analysis and subsequent qPCR validation suggested 27 lncRNAs were enriched in the EMT-related MAPK pathway. Among them, ENSMUST00000181751.1, XR{\_}001778608.1, and XR{\_}880236.2 showed high homology with humans.CONCLUSION: Exosomes from macrophages induce EMT in DN and lncRNAs in exosomes enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway may be the possible mechanism.}

This study aimed to develop an automated remote decision-making algorithm that remotely categorize a patient's emergency level using clinical parameters that can be measured with a wearable device.APPROACH: The algorithm was developed according to the following procedures. First, we used the National Trauma Data Bank data set, a large open trauma patient data set assembled by the American College of Surgeons (ACS). In addition, we performed pre-processing to exclude data when the vital sign or consciousness indicator value was missing or physiologically in an abnormal range. Second, we selected the T-RTS method, which classifies emergency levels into four classes (Delayed, Urgent, Immediate and Dead), as the primary outcome. Third, three machine learning methods widely used in the medical field, logistic regression, random forest, and deep neural network (DNN), were applied to build the algorithm. Finally, each method was evaluated using quantitative performance indicators including the macro-averaged f1 score, macro-averaged mean absolute error (MMAE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).MAIN RESULTS: For total sets, the logistic regression had a macro-averaged f1 score of 0.673, an MMAE of 0.387 and an AUC value of 0.844 (95{\%} CI, 0.843-0.845), while the random forest and DNN had macro-averaged f1 scores of 0.783 and 0.784, MMAEs of 0.297 and 0.298 and AUC values of 0.882 (95{\%} CI, 0.881-0.883) and 0.883(95{\%} CI, 0.881-0.884), respectively.SIGNIFICANCE: In a comprehensive analysis of these results, our algorithm demonstrated a viable approach that could be practically adopted in an MCI. In addition, it can be employed to transfer patients and to redistribute available resources according to their priorities.}

 abstract     = {Background: Electronic monitors (EMs) are commonly used as a sanction and to improve compliance with substance use treatment and reduce re-arrest in criminal justice settings. However, there is minimal evidence for their effectiveness, especially among women. Objectives: We examined whether the use of EMs (i.e., devices placed on one's body to encourage treatment compliance) increased rates of substance use treatment completion, and as a result, reduced re-arrest and substance use among women offenders. Methods: We sampled 114 women referred to residential substance use treatment and a subsample of 102 women charged with felonies. Logistic regression models accounting for clustering of time within person were fit. Results: Overall, EMs were associated with 3.13 greater odds of re-arrest after accounting for criminogenic risk indicators; however, no association was detected among women charged with felonies only. Women who were assigned to EMs were significantly less likely to report illicit drug use in the past 30days, and women charged with felonies were less likely to report both alcohol and illicit drug use in the past 30days. There was no association between EM assignment and treatment completion or positive urinalysis result. Conclusion: EM provision did not enhance the retention of women in residential treatment and the presence of an EM was associated with a more than tripling in the odds of re-arrest. Results also suggest that EM use for women in Specialty Courts may have some limited utility in reducing substance use; however, the mechanism driving this effect remains unclear.}

In areas such as sports and emergency response, the potential to provide comprehensive and simultaneous physiological insights across multiple body systems is promising. However, it is currently unclear what type of evidence exists surrounding the use of smart textiles for the monitoring of physiological outcome measures across different settings.OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to systematically survey the existing body of scientific literature surrounding smart textiles in their most prevalent form, the smart shirt, for monitoring physiological outcome measures.METHODS: A total of 5 electronic bibliographic databases were systematically searched (Ovid Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and SPORTDiscus). Publications from the inception of the database to June 24, 2019 were reviewed. Nonindexed literature relevant to this review was also systematically searched. The results were then collated, summarized, and reported.RESULTS: Following the removal of duplicates, 7871 citations were identified. On the basis of title and abstract screening, 7632 citations were excluded, whereas 239 were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 101 citations were included in the final analysis. Included studies were categorized into four themes: (1) prototype design, (2) validation, (3) observational, and (4) reviews. Among the 101 analyzed studies, prototype design was the most prevalent theme (50/101, 49.5{\%}), followed by validation (29/101, 28.7{\%}), observational studies (21/101, 20.8{\%}), and reviews (1/101, 0.1{\%}). Presented prototype designs ranged from those capable of monitoring one physiological metric to those capable of monitoring several simultaneously. In 29 validation studies, 16 distinct smart shirts were validated against reference technology under various conditions and work rates, including rest, submaximal exercise, and maximal exercise. The identified observational studies used smart shirts in clinical, healthy, and occupational populations for aims such as early diagnosis and stress detection. One scoping review was identified, investigating the use of smart shirts for electrocardiograph signal monitoring in cardiac patients.CONCLUSIONS: Although smart shirts have been found to be valid and reliable in the monitoring of specific physiological metrics, results were variable for others, demonstrating the need for further systematic validation. Analysis of the results has also demonstrated gaps in knowledge, such as a considerable lag of validation and observational studies in comparison with prototype design and limited investigation using smart shirts in pediatric, elite sports, and emergency service populations.}

 abstract     = {A mask that creates a physical barrier to protect the wearer from breathing in airborne bacteria or viruses, reducing the risk of infection in polluted air and potentially contaminated environments, has become a daily necessity for the public especially as COVID-19 has exploded around the world. However, the use of masks often causes soaring temperatures and thick humid air, leading to thermal and wear discomfort and breathing difficulties for a number of people, and further increasing the elevated risk of heat illnesses including heat stroke and heat exhaustion. When wearers become highly active or work under high tension, the excess sweat generated negatively affects the functionality of masks. Here, we report on an innovative design of an air-conditioned mask (AC Mask) system, facilitating thermoregulation in the mask microclimate, ease of breathing, and wear comfort. The AC Mask system is developed by integrating a cost-effective and lightweight thermoelectric (TE) and ventilation unit in a wearable 3D printed mask device, compatible with existing disposable masks, to protect end users safely against toxic particles such as viruses. A wind-guided tunnel has been developed for quick and efficient ventilation of cooling air. Based on a human trial, reductions in the apparent microclimate temperature and the humidity by 3.5{\textdegree}C and 50{\%}, respectively, have been achieved under a low voltage. With the excellent thermal management properties, the AC Mask will find also wide application among professional end-users such as construction workers, firefighters, and medical personnel.}

A systematic review is proposed to summarise up-to-date progress in applying physiological monitoring systems for occupational groups. Adhering with the PRISMA Statement, five databases were searched from 2014 to 2021, and 12 keywords were combined, concluding with the selection of 38 articles. Sources of risk of bias were assessed regarding randomisation procedures, selective outcome reporting and generalisability of results. Assessment procedures involving non-invasive methods applied with health and safety-related goals were filtered. Working-age participants from homogeneous occupational groups were selected, with these groups primarily including firefighters and construction workers. Research objectives were mainly directed to assess heat stress and physiological workload demands. Heart rate related variables, thermal responses and motion tracking through accelerometry were the most common approaches. Overall, wearable sensors proved to be valid tools for assessing physiological status in working environments. Future research should focus on conducting sensor fusion assessments, engaging wearables in real-time evaluation methods and giving continuous feedback to workers and practitioners.}

 abstract     = {Nimotuzumab is a humanized anti-EGF monoclonal antibody that has been approved for treating different cancers. However, few studies have examined its therapeutic potential in prostate cancer (PC), a most common and highly aggressive malignancy among male population. We used both LNCaP, and PC3 and PC3-AR (androgen receptor) cells as the model system and assessed the effects of nimotuzumab on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. The EMT makers were detected by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. MTT, wound healing assay, and transwell assay were used to measure cell viability, migration, and invasion, respectively. For mechanistic understanding, we evaluated the significance of Akt/Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1)/AR axis in nimotuzumab-induced EMT by overexpressing AR, activating Akt using SC79, and/or downregulating YB-1 using siRNA. Nimotuzumab suppressed the xenograft growth from both LNCaP and PC3 cells in vivo, which was associated with reduced EMT. Consistently, nimotuzumab inhibited proliferation, cell-cycle progression, EMT, and migration/invasion, but stimulated apoptosis of both LNCaP and PC3-AR cells in vitro. On the molecular level, nimotuzumab inactivated Akt and YB-1 and reduced the expression of AR. Boosting AR expression in LNCaP and PC3-AR cells antagonized the action of nimotuzumab, at least partially restored EMT, and enhanced the migration/invasion. We also found that Akt was essential for controlling YB-1 activation, and both critical for regulating the levels of AR and EMT-related biomarkers. In this study, we presented our novel findings that by targeting the Akt/YB-1/AR axis, nimotuzumab significantly inhibited EMT of PC cells. Considering that EMT is a critical mechanism contributing to the metastatic spread of cancer cells, nimotuzumab may become a promising therapy for alleviating the malignant progression of PC. {\textcopyright} 2019 IUBMB Life, 1-14, 2019.}

For the purposes of "deep-dive insights," further content and sentiment analyses were performed with MonkeyLearn and valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning. This triangulation in methodology enabled a comprehensive unstructured qualitative data analysis. The study identified key themes that characterize and define VC. It uncovered that, although there is predominantly positive sentiment toward VC reported in The Guardian online articles, negative sentiment also exists, presenting challenges for the industry to maneuver. The findings reveal that in the context of VC, a virtual experience is also a social experience in a virtual space, which is becoming and evolving. There are certain industries and sectors that are embracing VC, such as marketing, advertising and public relations, software development/IT, art/design, and entertainment, as well as science/technology. Some sectors and industries are experiencing challenges, such as security/law enforcement and medical, and hence display negative sentiment toward VC. Overall, this study presents a working definition of VC, a synopsis of the state of VC, and highlights areas for potential research to further our understanding of this phenomenon. It contributes to an improved understanding of VC for the industry and academia, and provides impetus for future studies focused on the emergent VC-relevant conceptual relationships.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Time to reperfusion is critical for outcome in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In our region, patients are routinely treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI), but rerouting patients from the primary receiving hospital to a catheterization center can cause unacceptable delays that may exceed 1 hour in the emergency department. Wireless transmission of prehospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) to receiving stations in hospitals has been shown to reduce time from symptom onset to reperfusion. However, transmission directly to a cardiologist's handheld digital device has not been investigated.AIM: To report preliminary data from a larger ongoing trial evaluating prehospital 12-lead ECG transmission to a cardiologist's handheld device in patients with symptoms suggesting an acute coronary syndrome.METHOD: Patients suffering acute, nontraumatic chest pain have their prehospital ECG transmitted by wireless technology directly to a cardiologist's handheld device at an invasive hospital, allowing diversion of STEMI cases to rapid pPCI. Transmission failures are documented. Times for symptom onset, 911 alert, ECG recording, hospital arrival, and pPCI are obtained. All time intervals are summarized as median values and are compared with historic controls from the Danish multicenter study, DANAMI-2.RESULTS: During the first 15 months of the trial, prehospital ECGs were transmitted for 408 chest pain patients with an overall success rate of 93{\%}. Cardiologist receiving the ECGs recommended that 113 patients (28{\%}) be diverted for pPCI. Mean time from symptom onset to 911 alert was 2 hours 16 minutes (range, 1 minute to 23 hours 15 minutes), and the ambulance response interval was 5 minutes (range, 1-25 minutes). The ambulance on-scene time had increased by 7 minutes compared with historic controls (P<.05). Time from ECG recording to hospital arrival was 25 minutes. The total prehospital time was 2 hours 57 minutes. The hospital treatment time was substantially reduced among diverted patients. Hospital arrival to procedure start was 40 minutes, compared with 94 minutes in the DANAMI-2 historic control group (P<.01).CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that transmission of prehospital 12-lead ECGs directly to the attending cardiologist using handheld devices is a technologically sound concept without major safety concerns and markedly reducing time to reperfusion in patients with STEMI.}

Ride-sharing services (RSS) have existed since 2010, but few studies to date have investigated their impact on AR-MVCs. We hypothesized that the availability of RSS would be correlated with a decrease in AR-MVCs at an urban Level I trauma center.METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all AR-MVC trauma activations at a Level I trauma center from 2012 to 2018. Additional data were gathered from regional governmental traffic and law enforcement databases, including crash incidence, fatalities, and demographics. Data were compared pre- and post-RSS and analyzed using an unpaired t test with p less than 0.05 considered significant.RESULTS: There were 1,474 patients in AR-MVCs during the study period. There was a significant decrease in the annual average proportion of MVCs that were AR-MVCs pre- vs. post-RSS (39{\%} vs. 29{\%}, p = 0.02) as well as a decrease in the average annual incidence of fatal AR-MVCs (11.6 vs. 5, p = 0.02). Subset analysis showed a decrease in AR-MVC incidence in 18- to 29-year-olds (12.7{\%} vs. 7.5{\%}; p = 0.03), which was also demonstrated by data from a local law enforcement database. Availability of RSS was also correlated with a decreased proportion of nighttime AR-MVCs (14.7{\%} vs. 7.6{\%}, p = 0.03) and decreased number of driving while intoxicated (1198.0 {\textpm} 78.5 vs. 612.8 {\textpm} 137.6, p = <0.01).CONCLUSION: We found that the incidence of both total AR-MVCs and fatal AR-MVCs presenting to our trauma center decreased after the introduction of RSS. Ride-sharing services may play a role in preventing AR-MVCs. Further research is needed to correlate AR-MVC incidence with granular proprietary RSS usage data and to account for any confounding factors. Future studies may identify ways to better utilize RSS availability as a targeted intervention for certain demographic groups to prevent AR-MVCs.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management, Level IV.}

Presented here is a one-dollar, disposable, paper-based microfluidic chip for real-time monitoring of sweat rate. The chip, pasted on any part of the skin surface, consists of a skin adhesive layer, sweat-proof layer, sweat-sensing layer, and scale layer with a disk-shape from bottom to top. The sweat-sensing layer has an impressed wax micro-channel containing pre-added chromogenic agent to show displacement by sweat, and the sweat volume can be read directly by scale lines without any electronic elements. The diameter and thickness of the complete chip are 25 mm and 0.3 mm, respectively, permitting good flexibility and compactness with the skin surface. Tests of sweat flow rate monitoring on the left forearm, forehead, and nape of the neck of volunteers doing running exercise were conducted. Average sweat rate on left forearm (1156 g{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}h-1) was much lower than that on the forehead (1710 g{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}h-1) and greater than that on the nape of the neck (998 g{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}h-1), in good agreement with rates measured using existing common commercial sweat collectors. The chip, as a very low-cost and convenient wearable device, has wide application prospects in real-time monitoring of sweat loss by body builders, athletes, firefighters, etc., or for further sweat analyses.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Over the past several decades, naturally occurring and man-made mass casualty incidents (MCIs) have increased in frequency and number worldwide. To test the impact of such events on medical resources, simulations can provide a safe, controlled setting while replicating the chaotic environment typical of an actual disaster. A standardized method to collect and analyze data from mass casualty exercises is needed to assess preparedness and performance of the health care staff involved.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of using wearable proximity sensors to measure proximity events during an MCI simulation. In the first instance, our objective was to demonstrate how proximity sensors can collect spatial and temporal information about the interactions between medical staff and patients during an MCI exercise in a quasi-autonomous way. In addition, we assessed how the deployment of this technology could help improve future simulations by analyzing the flow of patients in the hospital.METHODS: Data were obtained and collected through the deployment of wearable proximity sensors during an MCI functional exercise. The scenario included 2 areas: the accident site and the Advanced Medical Post, and the exercise lasted 3 hours. A total of 238 participants were involved in the exercise and classified in categories according to their role: 14 medical doctors, 16 nurses, 134 victims, 47 Emergency Medical Services staff members, and 27 health care assistants and other hospital support staff. Each victim was assigned a score related to the severity of his/her injury. Each participant wore a proximity sensor, and in addition, 30 fixed devices were placed in the field hospital.RESULTS: The contact networks show a heterogeneous distribution of the cumulative time spent in proximity by the participants. We obtained contact matrices based on the cumulative time spent in proximity between the victims and rescuers. Our results showed that the time spent in proximity by the health care teams with the victims is related to the severity of the patient's injury. The analysis of patients' flow showed that the presence of patients in the rooms of the hospital is consistent with the triage code and diagnosis, and no obvious bottlenecks were found.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the feasibility of the use of wearable sensors for tracking close contacts among individuals during an MCI simulation. It represents, to our knowledge, the first example of unsupervised data collection-ie, without the need for the involvement of observers, which could compromise the realism of the exercise-of face-to-face contacts during an MCI exercise. Moreover, by permitting detailed data collection about the simulation, such as data related to the flow of patients in the hospital, such deployment provides highly relevant input for the improvement of MCI resource allocation and management.}

The data were collected using systematic observation, registered daily in a spreadsheet and checklist, and analyzed through descriptive statistics.RESULTS: the generation of waste varied from 0.087 to 0.138 kg per patient per day. Waste management showed inadequacies in all stages, especially in the separation stage. Infectious waste was found together with common waste, preventing recycling, and piercing and cutting objects were mixed with waste from different groups, increasing the risk of occupational accidents.CONCLUSION: the study reveals the lack of an institutional waste management policy, as demonstrated by the failure of operational stages, involving problems related to management, physical structure, material and human resources at the units. This is relevant for health care units, considering the quality of patient care and its interface with sustainability.}

Nurses are often first responders at in-hospital cardiac arrests and receive annual basic life support training to ensure they have the adequate skills, and student nurses are taught this in preparation for their clinical practice. However, it is clear that some nurses still lack confidence and skills to perform basic life support in an emergency situation. This innovative study included 209 participants, used a mixed-methods approach, and examined three environments to compare confidence and skills in basic life support training. The environments were nonimmersive (basic skills room), immersive (immersive room with video technology), and the Octave (mixed reality facility). The skills were measured using a Laerdal training manikin (QCPR manikin), with data recorded on a wireless Laerdal Simpad, and confidence levels before and after training were measured using a questionnaire. The nonimmersive and the immersive rooms were familiar environments, and the students felt more comfortable, relaxed, and, thus, more confident. The Octave offered the higher level of simulation utilizing virtual reality technology. Students felt less comfortable and less confident in the Octave; we assert that this was because the environment was unfamiliar. The study identified that placing students in an unfamiliar environment influences the confidence and skills associated with basic life support; this could be used as a way of preparing student nurses with the necessary emotional resilience to cope in stressful situations.}

Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of the government-support program for OUAs and to suggest future directions for it.METHODS: We performed sequential-mixed method approach. Descriptive analyses and multi-level logistic regression were performed based on the 2015 Korean National Health Insurance claim data. Data for the qualitative analysis were obtained from in-depth interviews with health providers and mothers in OUAs.RESULTS: Descriptive analyses indicated that the share of babies born in the hospitals located in the area among total babies ever born from mothers residing in the area (Delivery concentration Index: DCI) was lower in government-supported OUAs than other areas. Qualitative analyses revealed that physical distance is no longer a barrier in current OUAs. Mothers travel to neighboring big cities to seek elective preferences only available at specialized maternal hospitals rather than true medical need. Increasing one-child families changed the mother's perception of pregnancy and childbirth, making them willing to pay for more expensive services. Concern about an emergency for mothers or infants, especially of high-risk mothers was also an important factor to make mothers avoid local government-supported hospitals. Adjusted multi-level logistic regression indicated that DCIs of government-supported OUAs were higher than the ones of their counterpart areas.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that current OUAs do not reflect reality. Identification of true OUAs where physical distance is a real barrier to the use of obstetric service and focused investment on them is necessary. In addition, more sophisticated performance indicator other than DCI needs to be developed.}

 abstract     = {Purpose: Cataract surgery is a procedure by which the lens fiber cell mass is removed from its capsular bag and replaced with a synthetic intraocular lens. Postoperatively, remnant lens epithelial cells can undergo an aberrant wound healing response characterized by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Aldose reductase (AR) inhibition has been shown to decrease EMT markers in cell culture models. In this study, we aim to demonstrate that AR inhibition can attenuate induction of EMT markers in an in vivo model of cataract surgery.Methods: A modified extracapsular lens extraction (ECLE) was performed on C57BL/6 wildtype, AR overexpression (AR-Tg), and AR knockout mice. Immunofluorescent staining for the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), epithelial marker E-cadherin, and lens fiber cell markers alphaA-crystallin and Aquaporin 0 was used to characterize postoperative PCO. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to quantify postoperative changes in alpha-SMA, vimentin, fibronectin, and E-cadherin. In a separate experiment, the AR inhibitor Sorbinil was applied postoperatively and qRT-PCR was used to assess changes in EMT markers.Results: Genetic AR knockout reduced ECLE-induced upregulation of alpha-SMA and downregulation of E-cadherin. These immunofluorescent changes were mirrored quantitatively in changes in mRNA levels. Similarly, Sorbinil blocked characteristic postoperative EMT changes in AR-Tg mice. Interestingly, genetic AR knockout did not prevent postoperative induction of the lens fiber cell markers alphaA-crystallin and Aquaporin 0.Conclusions: AR inhibition prevents the postoperative changes in EMT markers characteristic of PCO yet preserves the postoperative induction of lens fiber cell markers.}

All patients presenting with a minimally displaced LC pelvic ring injury were reviewed (<10cm displacement on static pelvic radiographs). Patients with X-rays (XR) in a pelvic binder (EMS stress) and with the pelvic binder removed were included. Pelvic ring stability was determined by attending surgeon evaluation of EMS stress radiographs versus static XR of the pelvis. Patients were treated non-operatively and allowed to weight bear or taken to the operating room for exam under anesthesia (EUA) and potential operative fixation. Clinical success of treatment was determined by evaluation of further displacement at the completion of their most recent follow-up.RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients of the initial 398 reviewed met inclusion criteria. Fourteen of 37 patients (38{\%}) were categorized as stable with no significant pelvis displacement seen on EMS stress and were treated non-operatively without further sequelae (4.6 months mean follow-up). The remaining 23/37 (62{\%}) were treated operatively. Occult instability was identified on EMS stress in 14 (61{\%}) of those 23 patients and the remainder were determined to be unstable based upon fracture pattern or EUA. All patients went on to successful treatment without significant pelvic deformity (7.8 months mean follow-up).CONCLUSION: The EMS stress XR is a valuable, opportunistic evaluation in LC pelvic ring injuries. This evaluation is a useful diagnostic adjunct to alert the provider that additional stress imaging may be indicated to evaluate for occult pelvic ring instability.}

Aldose reductase (AR) is a monomer enzyme in the polyglycolic metabolic pathway and belongs to the aldo-keno reductase protein superfamily. Our previous studies have found that AR as one of the most significantly up-regulated genes was associated with the development of bleomycin-induced PF in rats. It is not clear whether aldose reductase is related to the regulation of radiation-induced EMT and mediates RIPF. AR-knockout mice, wild-type mice and lung epithelial cells were induced by radiation to establish a RIPF animal model and EMT system, to explore whether AR is mediation to RIPF through the EMT pathway. In vivo, AR deficiency significantly alleviated radiation-induced histopathological changes, reduced collagen deposition and inhibited collagen I, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and Twist1 expression. In addition, AR knockout up-regulated E-cadherin expression and up-regulated alpha-SMA and Vimentin expression. In vitro, AR, collagen I and MMP2 expression were increased in lung epithelial cells after radiation, which was accompanied by Twist1 expression up-regulation and EMT changes evidenced by decreased E-cadherin expression and increased alpha-SMA and Vimentin expression. Knockdown or inhibition of AR inhibited the expressions of Twist1, MMP2 and collagen I, and reduced cell migration and reversed radiation-induced EMT. These results indicated that aldose reductase may be related to radiation-induced lung epithelial cells EMT, and that inhibition of aldose reductase might be a promising treatment for RIPF.}

However, it is still a challenge to detect the damage of firefighting protective clothing at an early stage when firefighters are exposed to excessively high temperature in fire cases. Herein, an ultralight self-powered fire alarm electronic textile (SFA e-textile) based on conductive aerogel fiber that comprises calcium alginate (CA), Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs), and silver nanowires (Ag NWs) was developed, which achieved ultrasensitive temperature monitoring and energy harvesting in firefighting clothing. The resulting SFA e-textile was integrated into firefighting protective clothing to realize wide-range temperature sensing at 100-400 {\textdegree}C and repeatable fire warning capability, which could timely transmit an alarm signal to the wearer before the firefighting protective clothing malfunctioned in extreme fire environments. In addition, a self-powered fire self-rescue location system was further established based on the SFA e-textile that can help rescuers search and rescue trapped firefighters in fire cases. The power in the self-powered fire location system was offered by an SFA e-textile-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG).

The work focuses on Explosive Ordnance Disposal operatives and shows that predictions of UHS risk can be performed in real-time with sufficient accuracy for real-world use. Furthermore, it is shown that the required sensory input for such algorithms can be obtained with wearable, non-intrusive sensors. Two algorithms, one based on Bayesian nets and another on decision trees, are presented for determining the heat stress risk, considering the mean skin temperature prediction as a proxy. The algorithms are trained on empirical data and have accuracies of 92.1{\textpm}2.9{\%} and 94.4{\textpm}2.1{\%}, respectively when tested using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation.

Secondly, we over-expressed or silenced the expression of osteopontin (OPN) using in-vitro transfection. Further, western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions of OPN and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers. Finally, cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay.RESULTS: Afatinib (≤5.0 mol/L)-resistant H1650 (H1650-AR) and H1975 (H1975-AR) cells were successfully established, and grew faster compared with both parental cells at the same time interval. Western blot analysis revealed that afatinib significantly promoted the expressions of OPN and EMT biomarkers in H1975-AR and H1650-AR cells. Gain and loss assays validated that OPN over-expression promoted acquired resistance to afatinib, and induced the expressions of EMT biomarkers in H1650-AR and H1975-AR cells. Conversely, silencing of OPN not only significantly sensitized resistant cells to afatinib, but also suppressed EMT progression in H1650-AR and H1975-AR cells.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that OPN was required for acquired resistance of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to afatinib.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: While aerosolized administration of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) agonists is the mainstay of treatment for pediatric asthma exacerbations, the efficacy of intravenous (IV) delivery is controversial. Failure to demonstrate improved outcomes with IV beta(2)-AR agonists may be due to phenotypic differences within this patient population. Our hypothesis is that children who respond more slowly to IV beta(2)-AR agonist therapy comprise a distinct phenotype.METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all children admitted to the ICU for status asthmaticus who were treated with IV terbutaline between December 2002 and September 2006.RESULTS: Seventy-eight children were treated with IV terbutaline according to guidelines that adjusted the dose by clinical asthma score. After examining the histogram of duration of terbutaline infusions, a 48-hr cutoff was chosen to define responsiveness. Thirty-eight (49{\%}) children were slow-responders by this definition. There were no significant differences in baseline asthma severity or severity on admission between the slow-responders and responders. Slow-responders required significantly higher total doses of IV terbutaline, higher maximum administration rates, and had longer ICU and hospital length of stay.CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in outcomes between the responders and slow-responders without differences in acute or chronic illness severity. Other factors may have lead to slower response to IV beta(2)-agonist therapy.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: PAIS exhibits a complex spectrum of phenotypes and pubertal outcomes. The paucity of reliable prognostic indicators can confound management decisions including sex-of-rearing. We assessed whether external masculinisation score (EMS) at birth or functional assays correlates with pubertal outcome in PAIS patients and whether the EMS is helpful in sex assignment.METHODS: We collected pubertal outcome data for 27 male-assigned PAIS patients, all with confirmed androgen receptor (AR) mutations, including two previously uncharacterized variants (I899F; Y916C). Patients were grouped as follows; EMS at birth <5 and ≥ 5 (EMS in normal males is 12; median EMS in PAIS is 4{\textperiodcentered}7) and pubertal outcomes compared.FINDINGS: Only 6/9 patients (67{\%}) with EMS <5 underwent spontaneous onset of puberty, versus all 18 patients with EMS ≥5 (p = .03). Only 1/6 patients (17{\%}) with EMS <5 developed adult genitalia reaching Tanner stage 4 or 5, versus 11/13 (85{\%}) with EMS ≥5 (p = 0{\textperiodcentered}01). There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients in being prescribed androgen replacement, who reached adult testicular volume ≥ 15 ml, pubic hair Tanner stage 4 or 5, above average adult height, had gynaecomastia, and mastectomy. No correlation was observed between EMS and in vitro AR function.INTERPRETATION: In PAIS with AR mutation, birth EMS is a simple predictor of spontaneous pubertal onset and satisfactory adult genitalia. This provides useful information when discussing the likely options for management at puberty. FUND: European Commission Framework 7 Programme, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, BBSRC DTP.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor (AR) is considered a marker of better prognosis in hormone receptor positive breast cancers (BC), however, its role in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is controversial. This may be attributed to intrinsic molecular differences or scoring methods for AR positivity. We derived AR regulated gene score and examined its utility in BC subtypes.METHODS: AR regulated genes were derived by applying a bioinformatic pipeline on publicly available microarray data sets of AR+ BC cell lines and gene score was calculated as average expression of six AR regulated genes. Tumors were divided into AR high and low based on gene score and associations with clinical parameters, circulating androgens, survival and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were examined, further evaluated in invitro models and public datasets.RESULTS: 53{\%} (133/249) tumors were classified as AR gene score high and were associated with significantly better clinical parameters, disease-free survival (86.13vs 72.69 months, log rank p=0.032) when compared to AR low tumors. 36{\%} of TNBC (N=66) were AR gene score high with higher expression of EMT markers (p=0.024) and had high intratumoral levels of 5alpha-reductase, enzyme involved in intracrine androgen metabolism. In MDA-MB-453 treated with dihydrotestosterone, SLUG expression increased, E-cadherin decreased with increase in migration and these changes were reversed with bicalutamide. Similar results were obtained in public datasets.CONCLUSION: Deciphering the role of AR in BC is difficult based on AR protein levels alone. Our results support the context dependent function of AR in driving better prognosis in ER positive tumors and EMT features in TNBC tumors.}

AR overexpression was also remarkably associated with unfavorable outcome (HR=3.478, P=0.001); however, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that it was not an independent prognostic factor (HR=2.089, P=0.056). This study has investigated simultaneous assessment of AR and EMT-related genes expression and indicated that concurrent overexpression of AR and Snail is an independent unfavorable factor for GC overall survival after adjustment with other variables (HR=2.382, P=0.021). Interestingly, the inhibition of AR signaling by potent AR antagonist enzalutamide suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion of GC cells via regulation of apoptosis-, cell cycle-, and EMT-related gene expressions.CONCLUSION: Our findings have clinical importance proposing AR as an important prognostic factor involved in GC progression and metastasis, and submit AR inhibition as an appealing therapeutic approach for GC patients, either as a single agent or in a combined-modal strategy.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In Italy, the number of accesses to the Emergency Units has been growing for the past 30 years. This, together with a low coordination between hospital and peripheral pediatric services, has brought to an unnecessarily high number of hospital admissions. For this reason, it is essential to plan and implement strategies able to improve the appropriateness of hospital admissions. In the '90s, the Short Stay Observation was extended to pediatric patients. As highlighted by the report "Guidelines for Pediatric Observation Units" (2005), patients receive considerable benefits from a short hospital permanence. The purpose of the study is to report data about the Pediatric Emergency Room activities in Italy.METHODS: In 2011, the Italian Society of Pediatrics promoted an online data collection to investigate organization and activity of Italian Pediatric and Neonatal Units. A form, containing 140 questions, was sent to 624 Pediatric and Neonatology Units. This study will be focused only on data regarding pediatric Emergency Rooms (E.R.) and Observation Units.RESULTS: 237 units replied, 183 if we focus on units with pediatric inpatient service. Based on the results, E.R Units were provided with a dedicated pediatrician in 56 {\%} of the cases: of these, 85 {\%} for 24 h. The majority of the patients were seen by a pediatrician. In only 8 {\%} of the units, patients visited by a pediatrician were less than 40 {\%}. The age limit was 14 years in 60 {\%} of the cases. In 72 {\%} of participating units a E.R. triage was carried out. Only 18 {\%} of units registered more than 10000 E.R. visits/year. The percentage of children hospitalized after accessing the E.R. was significantly higher in southern regions (more than 20 {\%} of the units hospitalized more than 40 {\%} of children entering the E.R.). 66 {\%} of the units were provided with an Observation Unit. In 61 {\%} of the cases, the duration did not exceed 24 h. In more than half of the structures, less than 10 {\%} of the E.R. visits went into observation. The type of remuneration was not homogeneous.CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the heterogeneity of the Italian reality, with great possibilities for improvement, especially in southern regions.}

Patients have free access to the emergency department (ED), which serves as the main portal of entry for most acute patients coming into the hospital. The ED is staffed with EM specialists at all hours. The purpose of this study was to describe a U.S. tertiary care hospital ED and the patient population that is cared for there.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive retrospective study of the patient population at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Emergency Department, from 1 January to 31 December 2003. Demographic data were collected for each patient, as well as estimated severity index score, diagnosis and ED disposition.RESULTS: 46,936 patients with a median age of 46.5 years where seen at the ED in 2003. Women represented 56{\%}. The majority of patients had an ESI triage score = 3. All of the main categories of ICD-9 diagnostic codes where represented among patients' ED discharge diagnoses. 65{\%} of ED patients where discharged home from the department. Approximately one third where admitted to the hospital.CONCLUSION: A broad range of patients are seen in the ED, which sets high demands for the knowledge and skills of the ED staff as well as co-operation between the ED and other specialties and hospital departments.}

 abstract     = {UNLABELLED: Introduction Disaster triage is the allocation of limited medical resources in order to optimize patient outcome. There are several studies showing the poor use of triage tagging, but there are few studies that have investigated the reasons behind this. The aim of this study was to explore ambulance personnel attitude towards, and experiences of, practicing triage tagging during day-to-day management of trauma patients, as well as in major incidents (MIs).METHODS: A mixed method design was used. The first part of the study was in the form of a web-survey of attitudes answered by ambulance personnel. The question explored was: Is it likely that systems that are not used in everyday practice will be used during MIs? Two identical web-based surveys were conducted, before and after implementing a new strategy for triage tagging. This strategy consisted of a time-limited triage routine where ambulance services assigned triage category and applied triage tags in day-to-day trauma incidents in order to improve field triage. The second part comprised three focus group interviews (FGIs) in order to provide a deeper insight into the attitudes towards, and experience of, the use of triage tags. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.RESULTS: The overall finding was the need for daily routine when failure in practice. Analysis of the web-survey revealed three changes: ambulance personnel were more prone to use tags in minor accidents, the sort scoring system was considered to be more valuable, but it also was more time consuming after the intervention. In the analysis of FGIs, four categories emerged that describe the construction of the overall category: perceived usability, daily routine, documentation, and need for organizational strategies.CONCLUSION: Triage is part of the foundation of ambulance skills, but even so, ambulance personnel seldom use this in routine practice. They fully understand the benefit of accurate triage decisions, and also that the use of a triage algorithm and color coded tags is intended to make it easier and more secure to perform triage. However, despite the knowledge and understanding of these benefits, sparse incidents and infrequent exercises lead to ambulance personnel's uncertainty concerning the use of triage tagging during a MI and will therefore, most likely, avoid using them.

A year before issuance of the most recent guidelines, we implemented protocol changes that provided a single shock without rhythm reanalysis, stacked shocks, or postdefibrillation pulse check, and extended the period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation from 1 to 2 minutes. We hypothesized that survival would be better with the new protocol.METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study took place in a community with a 2-tiered emergency medical services response and an established system of cardiac arrest surveillance, training, and review. The investigation was a cohort study of persons who had bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation arrest because of heart disease, comparing a prospectively defined intervention group (January 1, 2005, to January 31, 2006) with a historical control group that was treated according to previous guidelines of rhythm reanalysis, stacked shocks, and postdefibrillation pulse checks (January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2004). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. The proportion of treated arrests that met inclusion criteria was similar for intervention and control periods (15.4{\%} [134/869] versus 16.6{\%} [374/2255]). Survival to hospital discharge was significantly greater during the intervention period compared with the control period (46{\%} [61/134] versus 33{\%} [122/374], P=0.008) and corresponded to a decrease in the interval from shock to start of chest compressions (28 versus 7 seconds). Adjustment for covariates did not alter the survival association.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the new resuscitation guidelines will alter the interface between defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in turn may improve outcomes.}

 abstract     = {Purpose The cellular and molecular dynamics of DHT-induced EMT in MDA-MB-453 cells were investigated.Methods:PCR arrays were used to examine the expression of EMT-regulatory genes. Immunoblotting was used to detect protein levels and confirm protein-protein interaction following immunoprecipitation. Immunofluorescence was used to observe rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology. Cell migration was assessed by transwell assayResults: Change of cell morphology was concomitant with increased cell migration after treating cells with DHT. Exposure of cells to DHT for one hour was sufficient to induce changes in cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton after 72 hours indicating altered gene expression. A long-term lasting nuclear translocation of AR was observed after a short exposure of cells to DHT. Investigating the expression of 84 EMT-related genes revealed down-expression of beta-catenin, N-cadherin, and TCF-4 and increased expression of Slug, all of which were confirmed at the protein level. Yet, not only early interaction of AR and beta-catenin was observed following AR activation, inhibition of beta-catenin blocked DHT-induced mesenchymal transition and migration. Wnt signaling was found to be partially important in DHT-induced morphological alteration. The mesenchymal transition of cells could be induced by treating cells with an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, an enzyme that inhibits beta-catenin; this morphological transition could be reversed by antagonizing AR suggesting that AR functions downstream of beta-catenin.Conclusions: These results suggest that MDA-MB-453 cells undergo partial EMT induced by DHT, beta-catenin is critical for this phenotypic change, and AR probably reciprocally mediates the mesenchymal transition of these cells upon activation of GSK-3 beta.}

No increased sensitivity to UV and MMC was found. Genetic complementation analysis indicates that XR-V15B belongs to the same complementation group as the X-ray-sensitive (xrs) mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells described by Jeggo (1985). Biochemical analysis of XR-V15B confirms this finding: the mutant showed a decreased ability to rejoin double-strand breaks induced by X-ray as measured by neutral elution. After 4 h of repair more than 50{\%} of the double-strand breaks remain in comparison to 3{\%} in V79 cells. No difference was observed between wild-type and XR-V15B cells in the initial number of single-strand breaks induced, in the kinetics of their rejoining and in the final level of unrejoined single-strand breaks. Treatment with 5-azacytidine did not have an effect on the reversion frequency of XR-V15B, contrary to the results obtained with the xrs mutants. XR-V15B has been grown in continuous culture for more than 3 months without evidence of reversion. The mutation induction by X-ray irradiation at the HPRT locus is not significantly increased in the mutant, but at doses giving the same degree of cell killing, XR-V15B cells are hypomutable.}

 abstract     = {Androgens are functionally required for the normal growth of the prostate gland and in prostate tumor development and progression. Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is an important process during normal development and in cancer cell metastasis induced by factors within the microenvironment, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). This study examined the ability of androgens to influence EMT of prostate cancer epithelial cells. The EMT pattern was evaluated on the basis of expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin/beta-catenin, and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization in response to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 1 nM) and/or TGF-beta (5 ng/ml). Overexpressing and silencing approaches to regulate androgen receptor (AR) expression were conducted to determine the involvement of AR in EMT in the presence or absence of an AR antagonist. Our results demonstrate that androgens induce the EMT pattern in prostate tumor epithelial cell with Snail activation and lead to significant changes in prostate cancer cell migration and invasion potential. Expression levels of AR inversely correlated with androgen-mediated EMT in prostate tumor epithelial cells, pointing to a low AR content required for the EMT phenotype. These findings indicate the ability of androgens to induce EMT by potentially bypassing the functional involvement of TGF-beta, thus contributing to metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells.-Zhum, M.-L., Kyprianou, N.

Then primary prostate epithelial cells were sampled from patients who were suspected of PCa and had histological prostatitis (HP) confirmed by pathological biopsy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or BAY11-7082 were used to investigate the change of androgen receptor (AR) and AR-mediated transcription, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in primary prostate epithelial cells, and lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCap) cells.RESULTS: TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TGF-beta were significantly increased in HP and PCa compared with those in BPH patients. The proliferation of primary prostate epithelial cells and LNCap cells got the inflection point at LPS 10 g/mL. In an inflammatory environment with 10 g/mL LPS, both primary prostate epithelial cell and LNCap cell viability increased, and AR, AR-mediated transcription, and EMT processes were significantly increased. Inhibitors of NF-kappaB with 10 nM BAY11-7082 decreased AR, AR-mediated transcription, and EMT processes.CONCLUSIONS: NF-kappaB regulates AR expression and EMT in prostatitis and PCa, and NF-kappaB inhibitors may have potential therapeutic value.}

Cell migration, clonogenicity, sphere-forming capacity was assessed using PCa cells under all experimental conditions and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM; BR-DIM) treatment. Human PCa samples from BR-DIM untreated or treated patients were also used for assessing the expression of AR3 and stem cell markers.RESULTS: Overexpression of AR led to the induction of EMT phenotype, while overexpression of AR3 not only induced EMT but also led to the expression of stem cell signature genes. More importantly, ADT enhanced the expression of AR and AR3 concomitant with up-regulated expression of EMT and stem cell marker genes. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment decreased the expression of AR and AR3, and reversed the expression of these EMT and stem cell marker genes. BR-DIM administered to PCa patients prior to radical prostatectomy inhibited the expression of cancer stem cell markers consistent with inhibition of self-renewal of PCa cells after BR-DIM treatment.CONCLUSION: AR variants could contribute to PCa progression through induction of EMT and acquisition of stem cell characteristics, which could be attenuated by BR-DIM, suggesting that BR-DIM could become a promising agent for the prevention of CRPC and/or for the treatment of PCa.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Up to a third of elderly patients with major depressive disorder are treatment resistant, yet little objective evidence is available to guide the clinician in managing these patients. We report here our experience with elderly subjects with prospectively defined treatment-resistant depression in 2 separate research studies: one entailing an augmentation strategy, the other a change to venlafaxine extended release (XR).METHOD: Fifty-three elderly subjects with major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria who failed treatment with paroxetine plus interpersonal psychotherapy received 1 to 3 trials of augmentation with bupropion sustained release, nortriptyline, or lithium. Successively fewer subjects entered each sequential trial of augmentation. Twelve subjects subsequently received venlafaxine XR monotherapy. Response to treatment was defined as a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of < 10 for 3 weeks.RESULTS: Sixty percent of subjects (N = 32) responded to some form of augmentation, with 45{\%} (24/53), 31{\%} (5/16), and 43{\%} (3/7) responding to the first, second, and third augmentation trials, respectively. The mean time to response after starting the first augmentation trial was 6.0 (SD = 5.8) weeks. Forty-two percent (N = 5) of the venlafaxine XR-treated subjects responded with the mean time to response of 6.4 (SE = 0.9) weeks. Adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation and falls were more common in the augmentation subjects than in the venlafaxine XR subjects.CONCLUSION: We observed similar rates and speed of response with an augmentation strategy and a strategy of switching to venlafaxine XR in elderly subjects with prospectively defined treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Venlafaxine XR was generally better tolerated than the augmentation strategies. Further investigation of venlafaxine XR as a preferred strategy for treatment-resistant geriatric depression is warranted.}

Previous study showed that 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is an AR antagonist that also inhibits Wnt signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To investigate whether combined treatment with ENZ and DIM can overcome ENZ resistance by regulating Wnt signaling to inhibit AR signaling and EMT in ENZ-resistant prostate cancer cells, 22Rv1 cells were cultured in normal medium and treated with ENZ, DIM, and DIM with ENZ. Exposure of ENZ-resistant cells to both DIM and ENZ significantly inhibited cell proliferation without cytotoxicity and invasion in comparison with the control. DIM significantly increased the E-cadherin expression and inhibited the expressions of Vimentin and Fibronectin, subsequently inhibiting EMT. Co-treatment with ENZ and DIM significantly increased the expressions of GSK3beta and APC and decreased the beta-catenin protein expression, causing inhibition of Wnt signaling and AR expression, it also significantly decreased the AR-v7 expression and down-regulated AR signaling. Via suppression of Wnt and AR signaling, co-treatment increased the E-cadherin and decreased the Vimentin and Fibronectin RNA and protein expressions, then inhibited EMT. Co-treatment with DIM and ENZ regulated Wnt signaling to reduce not only the AR expression, but also the AR-v7 expression, indicating suppression of EMT that inhibits cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration to ameliorate ENZ resistance.}

 abstract     = {Chronic stress induced by long-term anxiety and depression can promote the malignant progression of gastric cancer. beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) is a critical mediator for chronic stress-induced multiple processes of tumor cells. However, the function of chronic stress in gastric cancer and its potential mechanisms in vivo and in vitro, especially at the cellular level, remain unknown. Here, we provide further evidence that chronic stress affected behavior and hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis related hormone levels in mice. Furthermore, immunofluorescence showed that emotion affected the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in patients' tissues. To address this, salbutamol, a specific agonist of beta2-AR, was utilized for simulating chronic stress and demonstrating the mechanism of stress in tumor progression at the molecular level both in vivo and in vitro. Salbutamol significantly induced EMT, migration and invasion via ERK (Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation, and the effects were reversed by the beta2-AR antagonist ICI-118,551. The promoting effects of salbutamol on EMT, migration and invasion were inhibited by phosphorylation inhibitor of ERK PD98059 in vitro. Analysis of xenograft models revealed that salbutamol significantly promoted tumor growth and adrenal volume, while ICI-118,551 inhibited these effects. In addition, salbutamol increased the expression of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and decreased epithelial marker E-cadherin in transplanted tumor tissue. In conclusion, salbutamol simulates a chronic stress model, which promotes tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells through beta2-AR/ERK/EMT pathway.}

It was hypothesised that prediction of needs for LSIs in trauma patients is associated with data quality. Also, a model utilizing vital signs and DQIs to predict the needs for LSIs would be able to outperform models using vital signs alone. Data from 104 pre-hospital trauma patients transported by helicopter were analysed, including means and standard deviations of continuous vital signs, related DQIs and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores for LSI and non-LSI patient groups. DQIs involved percentages of valid measurements and mean deviation ratios. Various multivariate logistic regression models for predicting LSI needs were also obtained and compared through receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Demographics of patients were not statistically different between LSI and non-LSI patient groups. In addition, ROC curves demonstrated better prediction of LSI needs in patients using heart rate and DQIs (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.86) than using heart rate alone (AUC of 0.73). Likewise, ROC curves demonstrated better prediction using heart rate, total GCS score and DQIs (AUC of 0.99) than using heart rate and total GCS score (AUC of 0.92). AUCs were statistically different (p < 0.05). This study showed that data quality could be used in addition to continuous vital signs for predicting the need for LSIs in trauma patients. Importantly, trauma systems should incorporate processes to regulate data quality of physiologic data in the pre-hospital and emergency departments. By doing so, data quality could be improved and lead to better prediction of needs for LSIs in trauma patients.}

However, the exact role of AR in PCa metastasis remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the function of AR in PCa. We found that eukaryotic translation initiation factor (EIF) 5A2, an elongation factor that induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa cells, was significantly upregulated after 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation and downregulated after anti-androgen bicalutamide treatment in PCa cells with high AR expression, but not in cells with low AR expression. Moreover, eIF5A2 knockdown could eliminate DHT-induced invasion and migration of AR-positive PCa cells. DHT treatment decreased epithelial expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin but increased the expression of the mesenchymal marker proteins Vimentin and N-cadherin. DHT therefore induced EMT, and knockdown of eIF5A2 inhibited DHT-induced EMT. Moreover, in vivo study, Luciferase signals from the lungs of the eIF5A2 plasmid group indicated higher metastasis ability, and the eIF5A2 siRNA group had lower metastasis ability. Our results suggest that AR positively regulates eIF5A2 expression in androgen-dependent cells, and stimulation of AR expression and signaling in prostate tumors promotes PCa metastasis by EMT induction and upregulation of eIF5A2.}

 abstract     = {Early studies suggested macrophages might play roles in inflammation-associated benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) development, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we first showed that CD68(+) macrophages were identified in both epithelium and the stromal area of human BPH tissues. We then established an in vitro co-culture model with prostate epithelial and macrophage cell lines to study the potential impacts of infiltrating macrophages in the BPH development and found that co-culturing prostate epithelial cells with macrophages promoted migration of macrophages. In a three-dimensional culture system, the sphere diameter of BPH-1 prostate cells was significantly increased during coculture with THP-1 macrophage cells. Mechanism dissection suggested that expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as N-cadherin, Snail, and TGF-beta2, were increased, and administration of anti-TGF-beta2 neutralizing antibody during co-culture suppressed the EMT and THP-1-mediated growth of BPH-1 cells, suggesting THP-1 might go through EMT to influence the BPH development and progression. Importantly, we found that modulation of androgen receptor (AR) in BPH-1 and mPrE cells significantly increased THP-1 and RAW264.7 cell migration, respectively, and enhanced expression levels of EMT markers, suggesting that AR in prostate epithelial cells might play a role in promoting macrophage-mediated EMT in prostate epithelial cells. Silencing AR function via an AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, decreased the macrophage migration to BPH-1 cells and suppressed EMT marker expression. Together, these results provide the first evidence to demonstrate that prostate epithelial AR function is important for macrophage-mediated EMT and proliferation of prostate epithelial cells, which represents a previously unrecognized role of AR in the cross-talk between macrophages and prostate epithelial cells. These results may provide new insights for a new therapeutic approach to battle BPH via targeting AR and AR-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways.}

Research on biofeedback integrates the fields of biological application (physiological behavior), system modeling, and automated control. This study proposes a new method for modeling and controlling heart rate variability as heart rate acceleration, a model expressed in the frequency domain. The model is obtained from excitation and response signals from heart rate variability, which through the instrumental variables method and the minimization of a cost function delivers a transfer function that represents the physiological phenomenon. This study also proposes the design of an adaptive controller using the reference model. The controller controls heart rate variability based on the light actuators designed here, generating a conditioned reflex that allows individuals to self-regulate their state through biofeedback, synchronizing this action to homeostasis. Modeling is conducted in a target population of middle-aged men who work as firefighters and forest firefighters. This study validates the proposed model, as well as the design of the controllers and actuators, through a simple experiment based on indoor cycling. This experiment has different segments, namely leaving inertia, non-controlled segment, and actively controlled segment.}

 abstract     = {The focus of our research is to identify the most frequently reported on-call discrepancies at our hospital by modality and level of resident training. Our intent is to identify specific areas of concern that may be amenable to improvement through initiation of dedicated resident training in the field of emergency radiology. Our study included 648 significant discrepancies from 193,722 studies ordered through the emergency department over a 7-year period. The overall discrepancy rates were calculated for each resident level of training and modality type. Significance was determined using chi2 testing with alpha=0.05. The most common types of discrepancies were identified. The overall rate of reported discrepancies was low for all levels of training (0.23-0.42{\%}) with a small, but statistically significant, decrease in rate for the senior residents. Common categories of discrepancies for all residents included fractures on radiographs (XR) and computed tomography (CT), masses and hemorrhage on CT, and lung nodules and pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Specific discrepancies reported more frequently for new call-takers included phalangeal fractures on XR as well as white matter disease, hepatic lacerations, pyelonephritis, peritoneal fluid, lymphadenopathy, and pneumothoraces on CT. It is our recommendation that radiology resident training programs ensure that the common discrepancies illustrated herein are specifically addressed as part of a dedicated emergency radiology course.}

Actual learning responses gleaned from survey data were examined using exploratory factor analyses and reliability analysis.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Unique learning response items were identified for minor, moderate, major events, and major near misses by an expert panel. A two-factor model of major event learning response was identified (factor 1=event analysis, factor 2=dissemination/communication of learnings). Organizations engage in greater learning responses following major events than less severe events and, for major events, organizations engage in more factor 1 responses than factor 2 learning responses.CONCLUSIONS: Eleven to 13 items can measure learning responses to PSEs of differing severity. The items are feasible, grounded in theory, and reflect expert opinion as well as practice setting realities. The items have the potential for use to assess current practice in organizations and set future improvement goals.}

 abstract     = {OIRD (opioid-induced respiratory depression) remains a significant public health concern due to clinically indicated and illicit opioid use. Respiratory depression is the sine qua non of opioid toxicity, and early detection is critical for reversal using pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. In addition to respiratory monitoring devices such as pulse oximetry, capnography, and contactless monitoring systems, novel implantable sensors and detection systems such as optical detection and electrochemical detection techniques are being developed to identify the presence of opioids both in vivo and within the environment. These new technologies will not only monitor for signs and symptoms of OIRD but also serve as a mechanism to alert and assist first responders and lay rescuers. The current opioid epidemic brings to the forefront the need for additional accessible means of detection and diagnosis. Rigorous evaluation of safety, efficacy, and acceptability will be necessary for both new and established technologies to have an impact on morbidity and mortality associated with opioid toxicity. Here, we summarized existing and advanced technologies for opioid detection and OIRD management with a focus on recent advancements in wearable and implantable opioid detection. We expect that this review will serve as a complete informative reference for the researchers and healthcare professionals working on the subject and allied fields.}

In this study, we consider the use of time series methods to forecast physical fatigue using subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and gait data from wearable sensors captured during a simulated in-lab manual material handling task (Lab Study 1) and a fatiguing squatting with intermittent walking cycle (Lab Study 2). To determine whether time series models can accurately forecast individual response and for how many time periods ahead, five models were compared: naive method, autoregression (AR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), vector autoregression (VAR), and the vector error correction model (VECM). For forecasts of three or more time periods ahead, the VECM model that incorporates historical RPE and wearable sensor data outperformed the other models with median mean absolute error (MAE) <1.24 and median MAE <1.22 across all participants for Lab Study 1 and Lab Study 2, respectively. These results suggest that wearable sensor data can support forecasting a worker's condition and the forecasts obtained are as good as current state-of-the-art models using multiple sensors for current time prediction.}

 abstract     = {Norepinephrine and epinephrine, catecholamine hormones that are major mediators for chronic stress-induced cancers, are implicated in the progression of a number of cancer cells, including gastric adenocarcinoma. However, the underlying mechanisms of these hormones have not been well elucidated. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial event responsible for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The hypothesis regarding whether the promotive effects of norepinephrine (NE) on cancer are in part due to its ability to induce an EMT program has not been proven. In this study, we show that NE does not only obviously induce EMT alterations in the morphological characteristics of gastric adenocarcinoma cells, but also increases the markers of EMT, including vimentin expression, and decreases E-cadherin expression, further resulting in cell motility and invasiveness. We also reveal that these actions are mainly mediated through the activation of beta2 -AR-HIF-1alpha-Snail signaling pathways. In summary, this study implies that NE induces EMT in gastric adenocarcinoma through the regulation of beta2 -AR-HIF-1alpha-Snail activity. The data provide a new perspective on chronic stress in a negative social and psychological state, which may be a risk factor for cancer development and progression.}

Here we describe a wearable glove-based sensor that can detect fentanyl electrochemically on the fingertips towards decentralized testing for opioids. The glove-based sensor consists of flexible screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with a mixture of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and a room temperature ionic liquid, 4-(3-butyl-1-imidazolio)-1-butanesulfonate). The sensor shows direct oxidation of fentanyl in both liquid and powder forms with a detection limit of 10 muM using square-wave voltammetry. The "Lab-on-a-Glove" sensors, combined with a portable electrochemical analyzer, provide wireless transmission of the measured data to a smartphone or tablet for further analysis. The integrated sampling and sensing methodology on the thumb and index fingers, respectively, enables rapid screening of fentanyl in the presence of a mixture of cutting agents and offers considerable promise for timely point-of-need screening for first responders. Such a glove-based "swipe, scan, sense, and alert" strategy brings chemical analytics directly to the user's fingertips and opens new possibilities for detecting substances of abuse in emergency situations.}

 abstract     = {Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across all 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1 st November 2018 and 30 th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8{\%}), travelled 5-10 km (30.6{\%}) and 10-29 minutes (46.9{\%}), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9{\%}). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5{\%}), travelled <5 km (26.9{\%}) and 10-29 minutes (38.0{\%}). For both, the least reported travel data was the mode of travel used to care (>90.0{\%}) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0{\%}). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.}

Moreover, once diagnosed and discharged from the hospital, the 30-day readmission risk in COPD patients is found to be the highest among all chronic diseases. The existing diagnosis methods, such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2019, Body-mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise (BODE) index, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), COPD assessment test (CAT), 6-minute walking distance, which are adopted currently by physicians cannot predict the potential readmission of COPD patients, especially within the 30 days after discharge from the hospital. In this paper, a statistical model was proposed to predict the readmission risk of COPD patients within 30-days by monitoring their physical activity (PA) in daily living with accelerometer-based wrist-worn wearable devices. This proposed model was based on our previously reported PA models for activity index (AI) and regularity index (RI) and it introduced a new parameter, quality of activity (QoA), which incorporates previously proposed parameters, such as AI and RI, with other activity-based indices to predict the readmission risk. Data were collected from continuous PA monitoring of 16 COPD patients after hospital discharge as test subjects and readmission prediction criteria were proposed, with a 63{\%} sensitivity and a 37.78{\%} positive prediction rate. Compared to other clinical assessment, diagnosis, and prevention methods, the proposed model showed significant improvement in predicting the 30-day readmission risk.}

 abstract     = {Some 21 million adults and children are labor-trafficked or sex-trafficked through force, fraud, or coercion. In recognition of the interface between trafficking victims and the healthcare setting, over the last 10 years there has been a notable increase in training of health care professionals (HCPs) on human trafficking (HT) and its health implications. Many organizations have developed curricula and offered training in various clinical settings. However, methods and content of this education on trafficking vary widely, and there is little evaluation of the impact of the training. The goal of this study was to assess the gaps and strengths in HT education of HCPs in the US. This mixed-method study had two components. The first component consisted of structured interviews with experts in human trafficking HCP education. The second portion of the study involved an analysis of data from HCP calls to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC). The interviews captured trainer-specific data on types of HT training, duration and frequency, key content areas, presence of evaluation approaches and indicators, as well as an assessment of barriers and strengths in HT training for HCP. NHTRC call database analysis demonstrated increasing trends since 2008 in calls by HCPs. Overall findings revealed the need for standardization of HT training content to assure correct information, trauma-informed and patient-centered care, and consistent messaging for HCPs. Evaluation metrics for HT training need to be developed to demonstrate behavior change and impact on service delivery and patient-centered outcomes for HT victims, according to our proposed adapted Kirkpatrick's Pyramid model. HT training and evaluation would benefit from an agency or institution at the national level to provide consistency and standardization of HT training content as well as to guide a process that would develop metrics for evaluation and the building of an evidence base.ABBREVIATIONS: AAP: American Academy of Pediatrics; ACF: Administration for Children and Families; CME: Continuing medical education; ED: Emergency department; HCP: Health care professional; HEAL: Health, Education, Advocacy, and Linkage; HHS: United States Department of Health and Human Services; HT: Human trafficking; IOM: United States Institute of Medicine; MH: Mental health; NHTRC: National Human Trafficking Resource Center; SOAR: Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Training.}

 abstract     = {Cataract is the most frequent cause of blindness worldwide and is treated by surgical removal of the opaque lens to restore the light path to the retina. While cataract surgery is a safe procedure, some patients develop a complication of the surgery involving opacification and wrinkling of the posterior lens capsule. This process, called posterior capsule opacification (PCO), requires a second clinical treatment that can in turn lead to additional complications. Prevention of PCO is a current unmet need in the vision care enterprise. The pathogenesis of PCO involves the transition of lens epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype, designated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our previous studies showed that transgenic mice designed for overexpression of human aldose reductase developed lens defects reminiscent of PCO. In the current study, we evaluated the impact of aldose reductase (AR) on expression of expression of EMT markers in the lens. Primary lens epithelial cells from AR-transgenic mice showed downregulated expression of Foxe3 and Pax6 and increased expression of alpha-SMA, fibronectin and snail, a pattern of gene expression typical of cells undergoing EMT. A role for AR in these changes was further confirmed when we observed that they could be normalized by treatment of cells with Sorbinil, an AR inhibitor. Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways are known to contribute to EMT. Interestingly, AR overexpression induced ERK but not Smad-2 activation. These results suggest that elevation of AR may lead to activation of ERK signaling and thus play a role in TGF-beta/Smad independent induction of EMT in lens epithelial cells.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ticagrelor, the first reversibly binding oral P2Y(12) receptor antagonist, improves outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) compared with clopidogrel. In the ONSET-OFFSET study (parallel group trial) and the RESPOND study (crossover trial), the pharmacodynamic effects of ticagrelor were compared with clopidogrel in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We now report the pharmacokinetic analyses of ticagrelor, and the exposure-inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) relationships from these studies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with ticagrelor (180mg loading dose, 90mg twice daily maintenance dose) or clopidogrel (600mg loading dose, 75mg once daily maintenance dose) in addition to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) [75-100mg once daily]. Ticagrelor administration was for 6 weeks in ONSET-OFFSET. In RESPOND, ticagrelor was given for 14 days before or after 2 weeks of clopidogrel in patients classified as clopidogrel responders or non-responders. Pharmacokinetics and IPA were evaluated following the loading and last maintenance doses. Exposure-IPA relationships were evaluated using a sigmoid maximum effect (E(max)) model.OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX (active metabolite) pharmacokinetics and exposure-IPA relationships in both trials, including the effect of prior clopidogrel exposure, and effects in clopidogrel responders and non-responders in RESPOND.RESULTS: In ONSET-OFFSET, maximum (peak) plasma concentration (C(max)), time to C(max) (t(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 8 hours (AUC(8)) for ticagrelor were 733ng/mL, 2.0 hours and 4130ng{\textperiodcentered}h/mL, respectively; and for AR-C124910XX were 210ng/mL, 2.1 hours and 1325ng{\textperiodcentered}h/mL, respectively. E(max) estimates were IPA >97{\%}. Trough plasma ticagrelor (305ng/mL) and AR-C124910XX (121ng/mL) concentrations were 5.2 and 7.7 times higher than respective concentration producing 50{\%} of maximum effect (EC(50)) estimates. In RESPOND, ticagrelor mean C(max) and AUC(8) following 2-week dosing were comparable between clopidogrel responders (724ng/mL and 3983ng{\textperiodcentered}h/mL, respectively) and non-responders (764ng/mL and 3986ng{\textperiodcentered}h/mL, respectively). Pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor were unaffected by prior clopidogrel dosing. E(max) estimates were IPA >96{\%} for both responders and non-responders. Trough plasma concentrations were sufficient to achieve high IPA.CONCLUSIONS: Ticagrelor pharmacokinetics in stable CAD patients were comparable to previous findings in stable atherosclerotic and ACS patients, and were not affected by prior clopidogrel exposure or clopidogrel responsiveness. Ticagrelor effectively inhibited platelet aggregation, and trough plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were sufficient to result in high IPA in stable CAD patients.}

 abstract     = {Home monitoring and remote care systems aim to ultimately provide independent living care scenarios through non-intrusive, privacy-protecting means. Their main aim is to provide care through appreciating normal habits, remotely recognizing changes and acting upon those changes either through informing the person themselves, care providers, family members, medical practitioners, or emergency services, depending on need. Care giving can be required at any age, encompassing young to the globally growing aging population. A non-wearable and unobtrusive architecture has been developed and tested here to provide a fruitful health and wellbeing-monitoring framework without interfering in a user's regular daily habits and maintaining privacy. This work focuses on tracking locations in an unobtrusive way, recognizing daily activities, which are part of maintaining a healthy/regular lifestyle. This study shows an intelligent and locally based edge care system (ECS) solution to identify the location of an occupant's movement from daily activities using impulse radio-ultra wide band (IR-UWB) radar. A new method is proposed calculating the azimuth angle of a movement from the received pulse and employing radar principles to determine the range of that movement. Moreover, short-term fourier transform (STFT) has been performed to determine the frequency distribution of the occupant's action. Therefore, STFT, azimuth angle, and range calculation together provide the information to understand how occupants engage with their environment. An experiment has been carried out for an occupant at different times of the day during daily household activities and recorded with time and room position. Subsequently, these time-frequency outcomes, along with the range and azimuth information, have been employed to train a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm for recognizing indoor locations when the person is moving around the house, where little or no movement indicates the occurrence of abnormalities. The implemented framework is connected with a cloud server architecture, which enables to act against any abnormality remotely. The proposed methodology shows very promising results through statistical validation and achieved over 90{\%} testing accuracy in a real-time scenario.}

Suicidal behaviour, the most tragic consequence of untreated or unsuccessfully treated depression, commonly develops in the first few weeks of antidepressive treatment before the onset of therapeutic action and is strongly related to certain specific symptoms of depression like anxiety, agitation and insomnia. The present paper reviews the newly discovered and well-documented antidepressive effect of quetiapine in bipolar and unipolar depression with special regards to its early onset of action, and its sleep-improving effects. Both beneficial effects play an important role in the reduction of suicidal risk frequently seen in depressed patients.}

High quality documentation of care can serve casualty care and to improve future care. Currently, paper casualty cards are used for documentation. Incomplete data acquisition and inadequate data handover are common. To resolve these deficits, the IDF-MC launched the BladeShield 101 project.OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of casualty care data acquired by comparing standard paper casualty cards with the BladeShield 101.METHODS: The BladeShield 101 system consists of three components: a patient unit that records vital signs and medical care provided, a medical sensor that transmits to the patient unit, and a ruggedized mobile device that allows providers to access and document information. We compared all trauma registries of casualties treated between September 2019 and June 2020.RESULTS: The system was applied during the study period on 24 patients. All data were transferred to the military trauma registry within one day, compared to 72{\%} (141/194) with a paper casualty card (P < 0.01). Information regarding treatment time was available in 100{\%} vs. 43{\%} (P < 0.01) of cases and 98{\%} vs. 67{\%} (P < 0.01) of treatments provided were documented comparing BladeShield 101 with paper cards, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Using an autonomous system to record, view, deliver, and store casualty information may resolve most current information flow deficits. This solution will ultimately significantly improve individual patient care and systematic learning and development processes.}

This quality improvement (QI) project examined whether identifying the benefit for early use of Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT C) and Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIW-ar) in the ED would avoid escalation of care and offset poor outcomes of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). A preimplementation chart review (N = 99) showed an average of 12{\%}-15{\%} of patients requiring escalation of care at the project site. The QI project utilized a single-group, pre-/posttest design. The setting was a Southwest Veterans Affair tertiary care referral center. Thirty-five ED staff members were surveyed for baseline knowledge and attended education sessions, led by an advanced practice nurse, on the use of AUDIT-C and CIWA-ar. Posteducation, patients admitted to the hospital were screened with AUDIT-C and treated with CIWA-ar. Postimplementation, charts were reviewed for admitted patients (N = 42) on the use of AUDIT-C, CIWA-ar, length of stay (LOS), and area patient treated. Although the test scores after didactic education were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.050), there was no significant difference in the use of AUDIT-C or CIWA-ar in the ED, nor a significant decrease in LOS for those patients with CIWA-ar ordered. However, the potential for clinical benefit could not be disavowed. Barriers to implementation included survey fatigue, inability to embed AUDIT-C in the electronic medical record, inconsistency in completing AUDIT-C, interrater reliability, and patient fear of stigmatization. Advanced practice nurses provide an integral role to augment early identification and treatment of AWS in the ED.}

In high-volume academic centers, essential staffing decisions can be made on the assumption that residents see patients at a static rate. However, it is unclear whether this model mirrors reality; previous studies have not rigorously examined whether productivity changes over time. We examine residents' productivity across shifts to determine whether it remained consistent.METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in an urban academic hospital with a 3-year emergency medicine training program in which residents acquire patients ad libitum throughout their shift. Time stamps of all patient encounters were automatically logged. A linear mixed model was constructed to predict productivity per shift hour.RESULTS: A total of 14,364 8- and 9-hour shifts were worked by 75 residents between July 1, 2010, and June 20, 2015. This comprised 6,127 (42.7{\%}) postgraduate year (PGY) 1 shifts, 7,236 (50.4{\%}) PGY-2 shifts, and 998 (6.9{\%}) PGY-3 nonsupervisory shifts (Table1). Overall, residents treated a mean of 10.1 patients per shift (SD 3.2), with most patients at Emergency Severity Index level 3 or more acute (93.8{\%}). In the initial hour, residents treated a mean of 2.14 patients (SD 1.2), and every subsequent hour was associated with a significant decrease, with the largest in the second, third, and final hours.CONCLUSION: Emergency medicine resident productivity during a single shift follows a reliable pattern that decreases significantly hourly, a pattern preserved across PGY years and types of shifts. This suggests that resident productivity is a dynamic process, which should be considered in staffing decisions and studied further.}

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental process in embryonic development and plays a key role in tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could regulate the occurrence and development of EMT through various complex molecular mechanisms involving multiple signaling pathways in PCa. Given the importance of EMT and lncRNAs in the progression of tumor metastasis, we recapitulate the research progress of EMT-related signaling pathways regulated by lncRNAs in PCa, including AR signaling, STAT3 signaling, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling, TGF-beta/Smad and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Furthermore, we summarize four modes of how lncRNAs participate in the EMT process of PCa via regulating relevant signaling pathways.}

 abstract     = {Falls are the primary cause of accidents for the elderly in the living environment. Reducing hazards in the living environment and performing exercises for training balance and muscles are the common strategies for fall prevention. However, falls cannot be avoided completely; fall detection provides an alarm that can decrease injuries or death caused by the lack of rescue. The automatic fall detection system has opportunities to provide real-time emergency alarms for improving the safety and quality of home healthcare services. Two common technical challenges are also tackled in order to provide a reliable fall detection algorithm, including variability and ambiguity. We propose a novel hierarchical fall detection algorithm involving threshold-based and knowledge-based approaches to detect a fall event. The threshold-based approach efficiently supports the detection and identification of fall events from continuous sensor data. A multiphase fall model is utilized, including free fall, impact, and rest phases for the knowledge-based approach, which identifies fall events and has the potential to deal with the aforementioned technical challenges of a fall detection system. Seven kinds of falls and seven types of daily activities arranged in an experiment are used to explore the performance of the proposed fall detection algorithm. The overall performances of the sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy using a knowledge-based algorithm are 99.79{\%}, 98.74{\%}, 99.05{\%} and 99.33{\%}, respectively. The results show that the proposed novel hierarchical fall detection algorithm can cope with the variability and ambiguity of the technical challenges and fulfill the reliability, adaptability, and flexibility requirements of an automatic fall detection system with respect to the individual differences.}

AR was overexpressed in S/P cells through lentivirus. Western blot assay was used to detect the EMT markers expression, such as E Cadherin, N Cadherin, Vimentin and Snail. MTT assay, soft agar colony formation assay, sphere formation assay and migration assay were used to investigate AR's roles in EMT of S/P cells. Cell signaling pathways associated with proliferation and apoptosis of S/P cells were detected simultaneously. And S/P cells were treated with in vitro combinatory use of LY 294002 (inhibitor of AKT signaling molecules) with gamma-TT and/or 5-AZA.RESULTS: Our data showed that S/P cells from LNCaP had high EMT markers expression, more tumorigenesis and strong migration ability. And in S/P cells overexpressed with AR, the expression of EMT markers decreased. In addition, these cells had less proliferation ability, tumorigenesis ability, self-renewal and migration ability. At the same time, targeting S/P cells with AKT signaling pathway inhibitor LY29004 and gamma-TT and/or 5-AZA could inhibit S/P cell's proliferation and tumorigenesis.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that AR played a negative role in EMT of PCa S/P cells, by regulating AKT cell signaling pathway, which could be a new strategy to treat castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).}

We found that inactivation of the androgen receptor (AR) reduces a transcriptional repressor (SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor, SPDEF) of CCL2, which mediates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate tumor cells. Cell lines derived from a prostate-specific Pten/Trp53-null mouse and capable of a spontaneous EMT were utilized for identification of CCL2, and showed that reduced SPDEF expression was associated with an elevated CCL2-activated EMT. AR signaling inhibits CCL2 through a SPDEF-mediated mechanism in that the SPDEF recognizes the CCL2 promoter and transcriptionally represses its activity. Ectopically expressed SPDEF reduced the EMT and rescued expression of CCL2 in SPDEF-expressing cells, which induced the EMT and promotes malignant functions of prostate cancer cells. In tissues from prostate cancer patients with ADT, low SPDEF levels were correlated with high CCL2 expression compared to patients without ADT. We present a novel mechanism that contributes to the EMT and metastatic phenotype observed in a subset of ADT-resistant prostate cancer, where the CCL2 is stimulated through the inactivated of AR-mediated SPDEF.}

Materials and Methods: We analyzed the available evidence and organizational models based on a support by TM in cardiology, including the applications of TM in cardiovascular disease based on a review of the literature. Results: The most important areas of application of TM in the field of cardiology are as follows: (1) Early prehospital diagnosis of AMI with EKG transmission; (2) Patient Remote control through wearable and devices; (3) Monitoring of patients with chronic heart failure; (4) Monitoring of patient's arrhythmias; and (5) Transmission of echo images to a III level center for a "second opinion". Conclusions: TM services should, therefore, be considered as a true diagnostic/therapeutic aspect of cardiovascular emergencies. It is necessary to educate medical staff and to provide a tempting environment for software engineers. Investing in infrastructure and equipment is imperative, as well as a positive climate for its implementation.}

Students were instructed to download the Fitbit, Social Rhythms, and Roadmap 2.0 apps onto their personal mobile devices (Android or iOS). Subjects consented to provide up to 10 saliva samples during the study period. Surveys were administered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at five timepoints - at baseline, 1-month later, 2-months later, 3-months later, and at study completion. The surveys gathered information regarding demographics, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and mental health resilience, with the aim of documenting the impact of COVID-19 on the college student population.RESULTS: This study enrolled 2,158 college students between September 2020 and January 2021.

Data collection and analysis are ongoing.CONCLUSIONS: This study examined student health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also assessed the feasibility of wearable sensor use and survey completion in a college student population, which may inform the role of our mobile health tools on student health and well-being. Finally, using wearable sensor data, biospecimen collection, and self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis, our results may provide key data towards the development of a model for the early prediction and detection of COVID-19.CLINICALTRIAL: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04766788.}

After controlling for confounding factors, rapid time to analgesia (not AR) was associated with shorter ED-LOS of discharged and admitted patients (p<0.001 and <0.05, respectively). When adjusting for confounding variables, ED-LOS is shortened by 2 h (95{\%} CI 1.1 to 2.8) when delay to receive analgesic is <90 min compared with >90 min for discharged and by 2.3 h (95{\%} CI 0.17 to 4.4) for admitted patients.CONCLUSIONS: In our study, AR was not linked with short ED-LOS. However, rapid administration of analgesia was associated with short ED-LOS.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: On 4 September 2017, patient care was relocated from one quaternary hospital that was closing, to another proximate greenfield site in Adelaide, Australia, this becoming the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. There are currently no data to inform how best to transition hospitals. We conducted a 12-week prospective study of admissions under our acute surgical unit to determine the impact on our key performance indicators. We detail our results and describe compensatory measures deployed around the move.METHODS: Using a standard proforma, data were collected on key performance indicators for acute surgical unit patients referred by the emergency department (ED). This was supplemented by data obtained from operative management software and coding data from medical records to build a database for analysis.RESULTS: Five hundred and eight patients were admitted during the study period. Significant delays were seen in times to surgical referral, surgical review and leaving the ED. Closely comparable was time spent in the surgical suite. Uptake of the Ambulatory Care Pathway fell by 67{\%} and the Rapid Access Clinic by 46{\%}. Overall mortality and patient length of stay were not affected.CONCLUSION: We found the interface with ED was most affected. Staff encountered difficulties familiarizing with a new environment and an anecdotally high number of ED presentations. Delays to referral and surgical review resulted in extended patient stay in ED. Once in theatre, care was comparable pre- and post-transition. This was likely from early identification of patients requiring an emergency operation, close consultant surgeon involvement and robust working relationships between surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Tele-Intensive Care Unit (tele-ICU) is care provided to critically ill patients by remote clinicians using audio, and video communications and network resources to access real-time patient information from physiologic monitors and the electronic medical record. Tele-ICU has been demonstrated in civilian healthcare to reduce mortality, improve care quality and safety, decrease intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) and ventilator days, and save money. General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital (GLWACH) is a small medical treatment facility with limited resources with respect to subspecialists and ancillary services.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2012, GLWACH identified the lack of board-certified critical care physicians and limited baseline critical care capabilities as gaps that reduced surgical opportunities, challenged critical skill sustainment, exposed potential patient safety issues, and resulted in costly patient transfers to network hospitals. To address these gaps, GLWACH partnered with the Baptist Health Tele-ICU Service, located in Little Rock, AR, to provide Tele-ICU services to its four-bed intensive care unit. Video Teleconsultation (VTC) equipment was installed in the ICU as was a vendor specific solution for accessing real-time patient vital signs and an "emergency" button. The emergency button functioned by turning on the VTC equipment and calling the Tele-ICU center in Little Rock immediately when pushed. To assess impact, hospital and ICU volume, acuity, case mix index, purchased care costs were monitored before and after implementation of the system. Additionally, a Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was administered before and after implementation.RESULTS: The implementation of the tele-ICU program at GLWACH increased hospital and ICU patient volume, surgical patient volume, and patient complexity. Purchased care costs declined by 30{\%} in the year following implementation and return on investment was {\$}233,311 (19{\%}). All measurements of the SAQ improved following implementation.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the implementation of tele-ICU in the MHS as a cost-effective method to sustain readiness amongst critical care clinicians and improve safety culture in MHS hospitals.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Airway remodeling is demonstrated in Asian patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the key mechanisms underlying airway remodeling. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an important contributor to airway remodeling. Although increased TSLP is found in AR, little is known about whether TSLP is involved in airway remodeling through induction of the EMT.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of TSLP on the EMT in human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) from AR patients.METHODS: Human nasal epithelial cells from AR patients were stimulated with TSLP in the absence or presence of the preincubation with a selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) receptor (SB431542). The expression of TGF-beta1 in the cells was evaluated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to assay EMT markers including vimentin, fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1) and E-cadherin, small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog2/3 (Smad2/3), and phosphorylated Smad2/3 in the cells. The levels of extracellular matrix components such as collagens I and III in supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Morphological changes of the cells were observed under inverted phase-contrast microscope.RESULTS: A concentration-dependent increase of TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein was observed following stimulation with TSLP. Furthermore, TSLP decreased the expression of E-cadherin protein, but upregulated the production of FSP1 and vimentin proteins along with increased levels of collagens I and III, and the morphology of the cells was transformed into fibroblast-like shape. Additionally, a significant increase was found in phosphorylation of Smad2/3 protein. However, these effects were reversed by SB431542 preincubation.CONCLUSION: TSLP-induced HNECs to undergo the EMT process via TGF-beta1-mediated Smad2/3 activation. TSLP is an activator of the EMT in HNECs and might be a potential target for inhibiting EMT and reducing airway remodeling in AR.}

Participants were 22 resident-grade physicians working in acute medical and surgical specialties prospectively recruited from a single UK Academic Health Sciences Centre. Data were analyzed from September to December 2022.Intervention: Participants resuscitated a simulated patient who was acutely unwell, including undertaking invasive procedures. Participants completed 2 scenarios and were randomly assigned to SC or MR-SC for the first scenario prior to crossover. The HoloLens 2 MR device provided interactive holographic content and bidirectional audiovisual communication with senior physicians in the MR-SC group.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was error rate assessed via the Imperial College Error Capture (ICECAP) multidimensional error-capture tool. Secondary outcomes included teamwork (Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery [OTAS]; range, 0-6 and Teamwork Skills Assessment for Ward Care [T-SAW-C]; range, 1-5), scenario completion, stress and cognitive load (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX; range 0-100]), and MR device user acceptability.Results: A total of 22 physicians (15 males [68.2{\%}]; median [range] age, 28 [25-34] years) were recruited. MR technology significantly reduced the mean (SD) number of errors per scenario compared with SC (5.16 [3.34] vs 8.30 [3.09] errors; P=.003), with substantial reductions in procedural (0.79 [0.75] vs 1.52 [1.20] errors; P=.02), technical (1.95 [1.40] vs 3.65 [2.03] errors; P=.01), and safety (0.37 [0.96] vs 0.96 [0.85] errors; P=.04) domains. MR resulted in significantly greater scenario completion rates vs SC (22 scenarios [100{\%}] vs 14 scenarios [63.6{\%}]; P=.003). It also led to significant improvements in the overall quality of teamwork and interactions vs SC as measured by mean (SD) OTAS (25.41 [6.30] vs 16.33 [5.49]; P<.001) and T-SAW-C (27.35 [6.89] vs 18.37 [6.09]; P<.001) scores. As reported via mean (range) NASA-TLX score, there were significant reductions for MR-SC vs SC in participant temporal demands (38 [20-50] vs 46 [30-70]; P=.03) and significant improvements in self-reported task performance (50 [30-60] vs 39 [10-70]; P=.01). Overall, 19 participants (86.4{\%}) reported that they were more confident in making clinical decisions and undertaking clinical procedures with MR support.Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that the use of MR technology reduced error, improved teamwork, and enhanced practitioner confidence when used to support the delivery of simulated emergency medical care.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05870137.}

However, the design principles of regulatory networks underlying non-genetic heterogeneity in cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the coupled dynamics of feedback loops involving (a) oscillations in androgen receptor (AR) signaling mediated through an intrinsically disordered protein PAGE4, (b) multistability in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and c) Notch-Delta-Jagged signaling mediated cell-cell communication, each of which can generate non-genetic heterogeneity through multistability and/or oscillations. Our results show how different coupling strengths between AR and EMT signaling can lead to monostability, bistability, or oscillations in the levels of AR, as well as propagation of oscillations to EMT dynamics. These results reveal the emergent dynamics of coupled oscillatory and multi-stable systems and unravel mechanisms by which non-genetic heterogeneity in AR levels can be generated, which can act as a barrier to most existing therapies for prostate cancer patients.}

Data on compliance and treatment events of patients wearing the WCD were reviewed.RESULTS: Among the 147 patients prescribed a WCD, 80{\%} were male with an age of 59 {\textpm} 14 years. The WCD was prescribed for the following reasons: primary prevention in the setting of a left ventricular ejection fraction≤35{\%} (53{\%}), secondary prevention when an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was not implanted (16{\%}), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator explantation (23{\%}), and other high-risk scenarios for arrhythmic sudden death (9{\%}). The median wear duration was 50 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 25 to 85 days) with a median of 21.0 h of wear per day (IQR: 15.0 to22.8h). High-voltage treatment was delivered in 3 separate patients, 2 of whom died. The third patient received 3WCD shocks without restoration of a perfusing rhythm and ultimately was resuscitated by emergency responders. No patients received inappropriate therapies.CONCLUSIONS: Events requiring therapy were rare and no lives were directly saved by the WCD. Future efforts are needed to improve identification of patients most likely to benefit from a WCD.}

This was a retrospective multicentre study which included patients admitted to emergency departments (ED) for whom blood cultures were positive over a 4-month period. Microbial results were compiled from the database of the laboratories. The relevant information was extracted from the computerized patient's chart. An efficient EAT was based on antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria. An effective antibiotic reassessment (AR) was defined as any modification of the EAT. Unfavorable outcome was defined as death of the patient during in-hospital care. Three hospitals and two clinics took part in this study, 169 patients with bacteraemia being included. The diagnosis in ED was undetermined in 21 cases (12{\%}), 35 patients (21{\%}) required intensive care, and 23 died (14{\%}). One hundred and thirty-six patients (80{\%}) received an EAT, the latter being efficient in 107 cases (63{\%}). An effective AR was performed in 116 cases (69{\%}). In multivariate analysis, risks factors for death were: ongoing cancer AOR (adjusted odds ratio) 3.34, undetermined diagnosis in ED: AOR 9.34 and severe sepsis or shock: AOR 6.98. Effective AR was a protective factor: AOR 0.28 [0.09-0.81]. One third of bacteraemic patients in ED did not benefit from AR. Improvement of antimicrobial stewardship should be associated with a higher rate of survival.}

 abstract     = {PURPOSE: To characterize performance among ED sites participating in the Emergency Quality Network (E-QUAL) Avoidable Imaging Initiative for clinical targets on the American College of Emergency Physicians Choosing Wisely list.METHODS: This was an observational study of quality improvement (QI) data collected from hospital-based ED sites in 2017-2018. Participating EDs reported imaging utilization rates (UR) and common QI practices for three Choosing Wisely targets: Atraumatic Low Back Pain, Syncope, or Minor Head Injury.RESULTS: 305 ED sites participated in the initiative. Among all ED sites, the mean imaging UR for Atraumatic Low Back Pain was 34.7{\%} (IQR 26.3{\%}-42.6{\%}) for XR, 19.1{\%} (IQR 11.4{\%}-24.9{\%}) for CT, and 0.09{\%} (IQR 0{\%}-0.9{\%}) for MRI. The mean CT UR for Syncope was 50.0{\%} (IQR 38.0{\%}-61.4{\%}). The mean CT UR for Minor Head Injury was 72.6{\%} (IQR 65.6{\%}-81.7{\%}). ED sites with sustained participation showed significant decreases in CT UR in 2017 compared to 2018 for Syncope (56.4{\%} vs 48.0{\%}; 95{\%} CI: -12.7{\%}, -4.1{\%}) and Minor Head Injury (76.3{\%} vs 72.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI: -7.3{\%}, -1.1{\%}). There was no significant change in imaging UR for Atraumatic Back Pain for XR (36.0{\%} vs 33.3{\%}; 95{\%} CI: -5.9{\%}, -0;5{\%}), CT (20.1{\%} vs 17.7{\%}; 95{\%} CI: -5.1{\%}, -0.4{\%}) or MRI (0.8{\%} vs 0.7{\%}, 95{\%} CI: -0.4{\%}, -0.3{\%}).CONCLUSIONS: Early data from the E-QUAL Avoidable Imaging Initiative suggests QI interventions could potentially improve imaging stewardship and reduce low-value care. Further efforts to translate the Choosing Wisely recommendations into practice should promote data-driven benchmarking and learning collaboratives to achieve sustained practice improvement.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) are highly represented among the incarcerated population and are frequent utilizers of the emergency department (ED). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are a recognized treatment option for individuals with OUD. Although the field recognizes the benefits of MOUD, we know little about what mitigating effects MOUD offered in jail might have on post-release ED utilization.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, we searched electronic medical records (EMR) for incarcerations in the Santa Clara County jail between 8/1/2019 and 8/31/2021 for individuals with OUD (N=4352) and collected demographic and medication administration data for these individuals. Individuals are considered as having received MOUD if they have at least one administration of methadone, naltrexone, or extended release (XR) buprenorphine during their incarceration. We also collected ED visit data from the same EMR for the 28days following release from the identified incarcerations. Using logistic regression, we compared ED use within 24h and 28days for individuals who are incarcerated and treated with MOUD with those not receiving treatment.RESULTS: Individuals who received methadone or XR buprenorphine during their incarceration were less likely to present at the 28days following release than those not receiving treatment, after controlling for age, race, sex assigned at birth, preferred language, and housing status. Most individuals accessing the ED within 28days of release do so within the first seven days, and the greatest volume occurred in the first 24h. Individuals released before noon had a lower likelihood of ED presentation within 24h than those released in the afternoon.CONCLUSIONS: Offering methadone and XR buprenorphine to individuals with OUD who are incarcerated is beneficial in mitigating ED utilization within 28days of release, although further research is needed to understand what other contributing variables, especially those related to follow-up care, could be influencing these results. If possible, release times for individuals could be shifted to the morning to maximize reduction in ED use within 24h of release. Alternatively, further research should investigate why release times appear to influence ED utilization.}

To date, studies comparing antibiotic options for ABS have compared amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMX/CA) immediate release (IR) versus other antibiotics, but have not included AMX/CA extended release (XR).OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the clinical advantages of AMX/CA XR found in a clinical trial setting translate to a naturalistic setting, relative to AMX/CA IR.METHODS: Data for this retrospective analysis were obtained from a managed care benchmark database that included >25 million patients from >30 health plans covering 7 US census divisions. Data from all patients aged > or =18 years with an index diagnosis of ABS between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003, were included. Episodes of ABS were classified as treatment successes (no additional prescriptions for antibiotics, ABS-related emergency department [ED] visits, or ABS-related inpatient hospitalizations within 30 days after the index prescription) or failures (> or =1 subsequent antibiotic prescription, an ABS-related ED visit, or an ABS-related inpatient hospitalization within 30 days after the index prescription). Treatment failures were subclassified as early or late. Mean costs were assessed for medical claims linked with a primary diagnosis of ABS and antibiotic pharmacy claims within the follow-up time period (through February 28, 2004). Descriptive statistics for demographic characteristics, utilization patterns, and success rates were calculated for each cohort. A multivariate general linear regression model was developed to assess differences in costs between the 2 cohorts.RESULTS: : Of the patients with an index antibiotic prescription filled within 3 days of ABS diagnosis (n = 241,511), a total of 3224 in the AMX/CA XR cohort (mean [SD] age, 41.8 [11.6] years; women, 57.7{\%}) and 23,638 in the AMX/CA IR cohort (mean [SD] age, 41.9 [11.6] years; women, 62.7{\%}) were included in the analysis. The rate of treatment success in patients treated with AMX/CA XR was 82.8{\%} versus 81.0{\%} in patients treated with AMX/CA IR (P < 0.015). Treatment success costs were significantly lower than treatment failure costs regardless of an early or late designation and ranged from 98 dollars to 110 dollars per episode (P < 0.001). After adjustment for background covariates, the mean cost of treating an episode of ABS was significantly lower for patients receiving AMX/CA XR versus those receiving AMX/CA IR (166.32 dollars vs 177.34 dollars [US 2004 dollars]; P < 0.001), representing a mean cost savings of 11.02 dollars per patient treated with AMX/CA XR over AMX/CA IR for ABS, regardless of treatment outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The results from this data analysis suggest that AMX/CA XR had significantly higher treatment success in ABS relative to AMX/CA IR in this naturalistic setting. AMX/CA XR was associated with significantly decreased total ABS-related costs in these adults.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Emergency department (ED) care must adapt to meet current and future demands. In Australia, ED quality measures (eg, prolonged length of stay, re-presentations or patient experience) are worse for older adults with multiple comorbidities, people who have a disability, those who present with a mental health condition, Indigenous Australians, and those with a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background. Strengthened ED performance relies on understanding the social and systemic barriers and preferences for care of these different cohorts, and identifying viable solutions that may result in sustained improvement by service providers. A collaborative 5-year project (MyED) aims to codesign, with ED users and providers, new or adapted models of care that improve ED performance, improve patient outcomes and improve patient experience for these five cohorts.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Experience-based codesign using mixed methods, set in three hospitals in one health district in Australia. This protocol introduces the staged and incremental approach to the whole project, and details the first research elements: ethnographic observations at the ED care interface, interviews with providers and interviews with two patient cohorts-older adults and adults with a CALD background. We aim to sample a diverse range of participants, carefully tailoring recruitment and support.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (2022/PID02749-2022/ETH02447). Prior informed written consent will be obtained from all research participants. Findings from each stage of the project will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication.

Because earlier works showed that moderate gabapentin doses were too low to clearly ameliorate severe AWS, we tested a higher gabapentin entry dose.METHODS: Inpatients (n = 37) with severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol revised (CIWA-AR) score > or =15 points) were given gabapentin 800 mg, and if their symptom score reduced within 2 h, they were termed 'early responders' and were then treated for 2 days with 600 mg gabapentin q.i.d. (i.e. a total of 3200 mg in the first 24 h) before beginning a taper.RESULTS: Twenty-seven (73{\%}) were early responders (baseline CIWA-AR improved from 17.3 +/- 2.6 to 8.0 +/- 3.6 points). In the remaining 10 patients, baseline CIWA-AR deteriorated within 2 h (from 20.1 +/- 4.6 to 21.5 +/- 4.65 points). These patients were switched to clomethiazole (n = 4) or clonazepam (n = 6), which is the usual treatment. Three of the 'early responders' worsened in the next 36 h and were then reclassified and treated as 'non-responders'. Among them, two developed an epileptic seizure.CONCLUSION: Oral 800 mg gabapentin (loaded up to 3200 mg in the first 24 h) is helpful only in reducing less severe and less complicated acute AWS.}

Literature reports a low success rate of prehospital ETI attempts, partly due to the care environment and partly to the lack of consistent standardized training opportunities of prehospital providers in ETI. Hypothesis/Problem The availability of a mobile simulation laboratory (MSL) to study clinically critical interventions is needed in the prehospital setting to enhance instruction and maintain proficiency. This report is on the development and validation of a prehospital airway simulator and MSL that mimics in situ care provided in an ambulance.METHODS: The MSL was a Type 3 ambulance with four cameras allowing audio-video recordings of observable behaviors. The prehospital airway simulator is a modified airway mannequin with increased static tongue pressure and a rigid cervical collar. Airway experts validated the model in a static setting through ETI at varying tongue pressures with a goal of a Grade 3 Cormack-Lehane (CL) laryngeal view. Following completion of this development, the MSL was launched with the prehospital airway simulator to distant communities utilizing a single facilitator/driver. Paramedics were recruited to perform ETI in the MSL, and the detailed airway management observations were stored for further analysis.RESULTS: Nineteen airway experts performed 57 ETI attempts at varying tongue pressures demonstrating increased CL views at higher tongue pressures. Tongue pressure of 60 mm Hg generated 31{\%} Grade 3/4 CL view and was chosen for the prehospital trials. The MSL was launched and tested by 18 paramedics. First pass success was 33{\%} with another 33{\%} failing to intubate within three attempts.CONCLUSIONS: The MSL created was configured to deliver, record, and assess intubator behaviors with a difficult airway simulation. The MSL created a reproducible, high fidelity, mobile learning environment for assessment of simulated ETI performance by prehospital providers. Bischof JJ , Panchal AR , Finnegan GI , Terndrup TE .

We then conduct a second review of literature and concepts related to several emerging, broad themes in data science, including the terms location-based services (LBS), geofences, wearable technology, activity recognition, mesh networking, the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Our objective in this second review is to inform how these broader concepts, with implications for networking and analytics, may help to advance natural resource management and science in the future. Based on methods, themes, and concepts that arose in our systematic reviews, we then augmented the paper with additional literature from wildlife and fisheries management, as well as concepts from video object detection, relative positioning, and inventory-tracking that are also used as forms of localization. Based on our reviews of positioning technologies and emerging data science themes, we present a hierarchical model for collecting and sharing data in forest and fire management, and more broadly in the field of natural resources. The model reflects tradeoffs in range and bandwidth when recording, processing, and communicating large quantities of data in time and space to support resource management, science, and public safety in remote areas. In the hierarchical approach, wearable devices and other sensors typically transmit data at short distances using Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or ANT wireless, and smartphones and tablets serve as intermediate data collection and processing hubs for information that can be subsequently transmitted using radio networking systems or satellite communication. Data with greater spatial and temporal complexity is typically processed incrementally at lower tiers, then fused and summarized at higher levels of incident command or resource management. Lastly, we outline several priority areas for future research to advance big data analytics in natural resources.}

Most envisage increasing the numbers of veterinarians in government employment. Why not at least combine this initiative, wherever possible, with far greater involvement of rural practitioners to deliver contractual public-practice services and provide an enhanced community interface? This could make the difference between having a local practice in a community or none at all, as well as promising to be more cost effective. The concept of rural community practice (RCP) envisages combining traditional services provided in a "mixed-animal" veterinary practice with an expanded portfolio of public-practice and communication services that meet the emerging animal, public, and ecosystem health needs of the collective community, not just those of animal owners. These services could include those involving active sentinel surveillance programs for both domestic animal and wildlife diseases; on-farm food safety; bio-security; traceability and export certification and audit programs; disease investigation, including foreign animal diseases; surge capacity emergency response; managing for ecosystem health; and client and community education. An expanded practice team of animal-health professionals and technologists, led by veterinarians, would deliver these services. This RCP approach should have the potential to make rural practice more attractive from economic, lifestyle, and job-satisfaction perspectives; to enhance the visibility and recognition of the profession; and to respond to changing and new societal needs. It also promises to maintain a stable network of veterinary practices in rural communities. In addition, the recognition of veterinary medicine as a public good should provide for consideration of increased investment by levels of government. At the same time, this new model could help meet the demands of animal and public-health government agencies that face expanding responsibilities during a sustained climate of reduced budgetary resources.}

 abstract     = {The long-standing challenge in the treatment of prostate cancer is to overcome therapeutic resistance during progression to lethal disease. Aberrant transforming-growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling accelerates prostate tumor progression in a transgenic mouse model via effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and neuroendocrine differentiation driving tumor progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is highly aggressive exhibiting reactivation of developmental programs associated with EMT induction and stem cell-like characteristics. The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical driver of tumor progression as well as therapeutic response in patients with metastatic CRPC. The signaling interactions between the TGF-beta mechanistic network and AR axis impact the EMT phenotypic conversions, and perturbation of epithelial homeostasis via EMT renders a critical venue for epithelial derived tumors to become invasive, acquire the neuroendocrine phenotype, and rapidly metastasize. Combinations of microtubule targeting taxane chemotherapy and androgen/AR targeting therapies have survival benefits in CRPC patients, but therapeutic resistance invariability develops, leading to mortality. Compelling evidence from our group recently demonstrated that chemotherapy (cabazitaxel, second line taxane chemotherapy), or TGF-beta receptor signaling targeted therapy, caused reversion of EMT to mesenchymal-epithelial transition and tumor re-differentiation, in invitro and invivo prostate cancer models. In this review, we discuss the functional contribution of EMT dynamic changes to the development of the neuroendocrine phenotype-the newly characterized pathological feature of prostate tumors in the context of the tumor microenvironment-navigated cell lineage changes and the role of this neuroendocrine phenotype in metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance.}

Allergic rhinitis (AR) was defined by skin prick test (SPT) positivity and the presence of any nasal symptoms (watery runny nose, nasal obstruction, nasal itching, and sneezing).Results: The mean age of patients was 48 {\textpm} 15 years (range 18-82); 55 (54.5{\%}) patients were female. SPT positivity was detected in 37 (36.6{\%}) cases. AR was detected in 32 (31.7{\%}) patients with non-CF BR. AR was related to dyspnea (P = 0.04) and number of admissions to an emergency department in the previous year (P = 0.01). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity in patients with and without AR were different (P = 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). AR was correlated with number of admissions to an emergency department in the last year (r = 0.417, P = 0.005).Conclusion: We concluded that atopy was detected in more than one-third of adult non-CF BR patients. This study demonstrated that non-CF BR patients might have AR; it might be important to be aware of nasal symptoms in non-CF BR patients.}

This study was undertaken to assess how varying contact pressures affects the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) measurement errors during motion artifact inducing activity. The study revealed that contact pressures ranging from 8-12 kPa resulted in the largest PPG amplitude for a reflectance sensor attached to the forehead region above the eye, although the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) did not improve significantly. However, SpO2 and HR errors increased when insufficient contact pressure was applied.

Our objective was to predict myocardial injury using continuous single-lead ECG waveforms similar to those obtained from wearable devices and to evaluate the potential of transfer learning from labeled 12-lead ECGs to improve these predictions.METHODS: We studied 10 874 Emergency Department (ED) patients who received continuous ECG monitoring and troponin testing from 2020 to 2021. We defined myocardial injury as newly elevated troponin in patients with chest pain or shortness of breath. We developed deep learning models of myocardial injury using continuous lead II ECG from bedside monitors as well as conventional 12-lead ECGs from triage. We pretrained single-lead models on a pre-existing corpus of labeled 12-lead ECGs. We compared model predictions to those of ED physicians.RESULTS: A transfer learning strategy, whereby models for continuous single-lead ECGs were first pretrained on 12-lead ECGs from a separate cohort, predicted myocardial injury as accurately as models using patients' own 12-lead ECGs: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.760 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.721-0.799) and area under the precision-recall curve 0.321 (95{\%} CI, 0.251-0.397). Models demonstrated a high negative predictive value for myocardial injury among patients with chest pain or shortness of breath, exceeding the predictive performance of ED physicians, while attending to known stigmata of myocardial injury.CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning models pretrained on labeled 12-lead ECGs can predict myocardial injury from noisy, continuous monitor data early in a patient's presentation. The utility of continuous single-lead ECG in the risk stratification of chest pain has implications for wearable devices and preclinical settings, where external validation of the approach is needed.}

Machine learning/artificial intelligence has helped to automate the detection of other visual structures but its utility with ETI is unknown. We sought to test the accuracy of various computer algorithms in identifying the glottic opening, creating a tool that could aid successful intubation.METHODS: We collected a convenience sample of providers who each performed ETI 10times on a mannequin using a video laryngoscope (C-MAC, Karl Storz Corp, Tuttlingen, Germany). We recorded each attempt and reviewed one-second time intervals for the presence or absence of the glottic opening. Four different machine learning/artificial intelligence algorithms analyzed each attempt and time point: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision trees, and neural networks (NN). We used half of the videos to train the algorithms and the second half to test the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each algorithm.RESULTS: We enrolled seven providers, three Emergency Medicine attendings, and four paramedic students. From the 70 total recorded laryngoscopic video attempts, we created 2,465 time intervals. The algorithms had the following sensitivity and specificity for detecting the glottic opening: KNN (70{\%}, 90{\%}), SVM (70{\%}, 90{\%}), decision trees (68{\%}, 80{\%}), and NN (72{\%}, 78{\%}).CONCLUSIONS: Initial efforts at computer algorithms using artificial intelligence are able to identify the glottic opening with over 80{\%} accuracy. With further refinements, video laryngoscopy has the potential to provide real-time, direction feedback to the provider to help guide successful ETI.}

 abstract     = {The mechanisms underlying inter-individual variation in adaptation to exercise have yet to be fully elucidated. Recently, high responders to resistance training (RT) have demonstrated greater levels of androgen receptor (AR) content, and therefore AR may be a factor underlying the variation in the adaptive response to resistance exercise. Moreover, there has been inconclusive findings surrounding the impact of AR content in females as well as following damage. In the current study, twenty-six healthy young men (n=13) and women (n=13) underwent an acute bout of damaging exercise consisting of 300 eccentric kicks, followed by 10 weeks of full-body RT to investigate changes in AR content following acute muscle damage and following chronic resistance exercise. This was assessed in the context of the satellite cell response and during muscle repair and hypertrophy. Skeletal muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken at baseline, 48 hours post damage and 48 hours following the last bout of RT. RT-qPCR and western blots were performed to quantify AR gene expression and protein content, respectively. An immunofluorescence staining protocol was optimized for the visualization of AR protein abundance. Results were considered in the context of the SC response and muscle hypertrophy data from the same cohort. AR content increased from baseline (30457 +/- 4399 a.u.) to post-damage (66448 +/- 8083 a.u.) by 218{\%} (p=0.005) and post RT (60889 +/- 6636 a.u.) by 199{\%} (p=0.003). Those with the greatest increase in SC content post-damage also had the greatest increase in AR content (p=0.01). Individuals with the greatest increase in leg-lean mass following RT also had the greatest increase in AR content (p=0.05). Preliminary data from western blot analysis revealed that AR protein content post-damage in males was correlated with activated SC number (MyoD+ cells) (p=0.01). We then aimed to investigate sex differences in the context of AR content since there is a paucity of work in females. Males (61550 +/- 10961 a.u.) had a 198{\%} greater change in AR content than females (31104 +/- 7499 a.u) from baseline to post-damage (p=0.03). Males also had a greater change in AR content (3.186 +/- 0.5443) than females (2.003 +/- 0.2625) post-RT, relative to baseline. In males, those with greater relative gains in muscle fibre CSA (high responders), post-RT, had a 373{\%} greater change in AR content (64936 +/- 11783 a.u.) from baseline to post-RT than low responders (17388 +/- 15438) (p = 0.03). Interestingly in females, those with greater relative gain in CSA post-RT (1.681 +/- 0.4120) had a trend towards lower AR content post-RT compared to low responders (2.502 +/- 0.1946) (p = 0.06). This study is the first to immunofluorescently stain AR content for visualization and quantification in skeletal muscle. Collectively, these findings suggest that AR content influences SC activity and exhibits sex differences following damage and chronic resistance exercise.}

 abstract     = {Human stress is intricately linked with mental processes such as decision making. Public protection practitioners, including Law Enforcement Agents (LEAs), are forced to make difficult decisions during high-pressure operations, under strenuous circumstances. In this respect, systems and applications that assist such practitioners to take decisions, are increasingly incorporating user stress level information for their development, adaptation, and evaluation. To that end, our goal is to accurately detect and classify the level of acute, short-term stress, in real time, for the development of personalized, context-aware solutions for LEAs. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been gaining traction in the field of stress analysis, exhibiting promising results. Furthermore, the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, have also been widely adopted for estimating levels of stress. In this work, we propose two CNN architectures for the stress detection and 3-level (low, moderate, high) stress classification tasks, using ultra short-term raw ECG signals (3 s). One architecture is simple and with a low memory footprint, suitable for running in wearable edge-computing nodes, and the other is able to learn more complex features, having more trainable parameters. The models were trained on the two publicly available stress classification datasets, after applying pre-processing techniques, such as data pruning, down-sampling, and data augmentation, using a sliding window approach. After hyperparameter tuning, using 4-fold cross-validation, the evaluation on the test set demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy both on the 3- and 2-level stress classification task using the DriveDB dataset, reporting an accuracy of 83.55{\%} and 98.77{\%} respectively.}

This study includes patients, who received blood products or died before receiving blood, treated at US military medical treatment facilities. The primary endpoints are survival at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 30 days postinjury. Secondary outcomes include infection, renal dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, and thromboembolic event. Exposure will be defined by blood product transfusion. Study groups will be frequency matched. Cox proportional hazards will compare patients who received warm fresh whole blood, low titer type-O whole blood, or only component therapy, while using adjustment for type of blood product transfused as a time-dependent covariate. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression will determine the effect of incompatible plasma in low titer type-O whole blood.RESULTS: An analysis plan for the Deployed HEROES study was developed with the aim of minimizing bias.CONCLUSION: This study will inform the optimal resuscitation strategies, which will potentially have a substantial impact on combat mortality. If whole blood is found to be the optimal transfusion strategy, this finding will be crucial in future operating environments involving dispersed medical assets. These results will provide critical information necessary for combat casualty care guidelines.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic and epidemiological; Level III.}

Objective means of measuring stress while at work can facilitate research into stress reduction interventions, and wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) technology has been proposed as a potential solution. However, the use of low-burden wearable biosensors to study training and clinical practice among emergency physicians (EP) remains untested.OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to (1) determine the feasibility of recording on-shift photoplethysmographic data from EP, (2) assess the quality of these data, and (3) calculate standard pulse rate variability (PRV) metrics from the acquired dataset and examine patterns in these variables over the course of an academic year.METHODS: A total of 21 EP wore PPG biosensors on their wrists during clinical work in the emergency department during a 9-hour shift. Recordings were collected during the first quarter of the academic year, then again during the fourth quarter of the same year for comparison. The overall rate of usable data collection per time was computed. Standard pulse rate (PR) and PRV metrics from these two time points were calculated and entered into Student t tests.RESULTS: More than 400 hours of data were entered into these analyses. Interpretable data were captured during 8.54{\%} of the total recording time overall. In the fourth quarter of the academic year compared with the first quarter, there was no significant difference in median PR (75.8 vs 76.8; P=.57), mean R-R interval (0.81 vs 0.80; P=.32), SD of R-R interval (0.11 vs 0.11; P=.93), root mean square of successive difference of R-R interval (0.81 vs 0.80; P=.96), low-frequency power (3.5*103 vs 3.4*103; P=.79), high-frequency power (8.5*103 vs 8.3*103; P=.91), or low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (0.42 vs 0.41; P=.43), respectively. Power estimates for each of these tests exceeded .90. A secondary analysis of the resident-only subgroup similarly showed no significant differences over time, despite power estimates greater than .80.CONCLUSIONS: Although the use of PPG biosensors to record real-time physiological data from EP while providing clinical care seems operationally feasible, this study fails to support the notion that such an approach can efficiently provide reliable estimates of metrics of interest. No significant differences in PR or PRV metrics were found at the end of the year compared with the beginning. Although these methods may offer useful applications to other domains, it may currently have limited utility in the contexts of physician training and wellness.}

Care has varied significantly, with a heavy reliance on abdominal radiography (AR) for the diagnosis of and inpatient management for bowel cleanout. We implemented a standardized approach to caring for patients presenting to a pediatric ED with symptoms consistent with constipation, emphasizing clinical history, physical examination, less reliance on AR, and standardized home management.METHODS: Using quality improvement (QI) methodology, a multidisciplinary group developed an ED constipation management pathway, encouraging less reliance on AR for diagnosis and promoting home management over inpatient bowel cleanout. The pathway included a home management "gift basket" containing over-the-counter medications and educational materials to promote successful bowel cleanout. Outcome measures included pathway utilization, AR rate, ED cost and length of stay, and ED admission rate for constipation.RESULTS: Within 3 months, >90{\%} of patients discharged home with an ED disposition diagnosis of constipation left with standardized educational materials and home medications. Staff education and feedback, pathway and gift basket changes, and a higher threshold for inpatient management led to significant decreases in AR rate (73.3{\%}-24.6{\%}, P < .001), average per-patient cost ({\$}637.42-{\$}538.85), length of stay (223-196 minutes, P < .001), and ED admission rate (15.3{\%}-5.4{\%}, P < .001), with no concerning missed diagnoses or increases in ED revisit rate.CONCLUSIONS: An ED QI project standardizing the care of pediatric constipation was implemented successfully, leading to a sustainable decrease in resource utilization.

We aimed to quantitatively assess the external genital phenotype in relation to AR genotype and sex of rearing and identify criteria that differentiate mutation positive (ARmt) from mutation negative (ARwt) PAIS patients.PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Cases with a diagnosis of PAIS were identified from the Cambridge Intersex Database. An external masculinization score (EMS) was used to quantify the degree of undermasculinization. Family history of AIS and details of the sex of rearing were recorded. Androgen binding was analysed in fibroblasts obtained from genital skin biopsies and mutational analysis of the AR was performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood. EMS and sex of rearing were compared in cases with similar mutations reported on the McGill International Database.RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-three patients with PAIS were identified. Androgen receptor gene sequencing was performed in 111 patients. Twenty-seven (24{\%}) had mutations. Family history of AIS was present in 61 and 21{\%} of ARmt and ARwt patients, respectively. The median EMS was 3 in both groups. The majority of ARmt patients had abnormal binding and there was a tendency to a higher median testosterone rise on hCG stimulation in ARmt (9.3 nmol/l) compared with ARwt patients (6.9 nmol/l). All patients with EMS of 4 or more were raised as male but there was an overlap of sex of rearing in patients with an EMS less than 4. A wide variation of EMS in relation to genotype and sex of rearing was observed.CONCLUSION: The phenotype in PAIS is extremely variable and is rarely predicted by the AR genotype. Apart from the family history, there are no specific criteria to differentiate ARwt from ARmt. Sex of rearing is not entirely dependent on the EMS. Cultural issues, other modifying genes and response to androgen trials might be influencing factors. Collaborative studies with uniform protocols are needed to investigate infants with PAIS. Documenting phenotype, surgical procedures and outcome criteria are necessary to enable decision-making on the sex of rearing in patients with a lower range EMS.}

P68 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF signaling facilitates cancer metastasis by promoting EMT. In this report, we show that p68 promotes breast cancer cell EMT and cell migration by upregulation of PDGF receptor beta (PDGFR-beta). Knockdown of p68 in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells significantly decreases PDGFR-beta both in mRNA and protein levels. P68 promotes EMT and cell migration in response to PDGF-BB stimulation via upregulation of PDGFR-beta, suggesting that p68 enhances PDGF signaling by a positive feedback loop in cancer cells. Furthermore, our study reveals that p68 mediates the effects of PDGFR-beta in regulation of androgen receptor (AR) in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that p68 and PDGFR-beta co-regulate AR expression and promote androgen-mediated proliferation in breast cancer cells. Our studies uncover an important pathway of p68-PDGFR-beta axis in promoting breast cancer progression.}

It is unclear whether COVID-19 has impacted the ability of residents in the wildland-urban interface to prepare for and evacuate from wildfire, or the extent to which residents feel their household's safety has been affected. Several areas with high wildfire risk are also experiencing record numbers of COVID-19 cases, including the state of Arizona in the southwestern United States. We conducted a mixed-mode survey of households in close proximity to two recent wildfires in rural Arizona to better understand whether residents living in the wildland-urban interface perceive COVID-19 as a factor in wildfire safety. Preliminary data suggest that the current challenges around collective action to address wildfire risk may be further exacerbated due to COVID-19, and that the current pandemic has potentially widened existing disparities in household capacity to conduct wildfire risk mitigation activities in the wildland-urban interface. Proactive planning for wildfire has also increased perceived ability to practice safe distancing from others during evacuation, highlighting the benefits that household planning for wildfire can have on other concurrent hazards. Parallels in both the wildfire and pandemic literature highlight vast opportunities for future research that can expand upon and advance our findings.}

Cell proliferation, and migration capacity were determined in bladder cancer T24 cells treated with small interfering RNA directed against AR, and expression levels of E-cadherin, beta-catenin and N- cadherin were assessed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Tumour cell growth was evaluated in vivo in T24 tumour-bearing nude mice receiving electroporation-assisted administration of anti-AR small interfering RNA. It was found that low AR expression decreased proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells. In vivo experiments showed that silencing AR expression significantly suppressed AR-positive bladder tumour growth with decreased cell proliferation. Low AR level of T24 bladder cancer cells treated with dehydrotestosterone (DHT) decreased expression of E-cadherin, beta-catenin and N-cadherin expression, indicating a strong sensitivity to the EMT and In cells with low AR content, TGF-beta induced down-regulation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin. It is concluded that suppression of AR expression decreased the production of TGF-beta, inhibiting EMT and bladder cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, implying that its use might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of bladder cancer.}

Fusion of pre-interventional information (e.g., CT, MRI, or US) and intra-interventional information (e.g., bronchoscopic video) were incorporated into a navigation system to provide physicians with an augmented reality environment for bronchoscopic interventions.METHODS: Two approaches were used to predict bronchoscope movements by incorporating sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) simulation including (1) image-based tracking techniques and (2) electromagnetic tracking (EMT) methods. SMC simulation was introduced to model ambiguities or uncertainties that occurred in image- and EMT-based bronchoscope tracking. Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features were employed to overcome the limitations of image-based motion tracking methods. Validation was performed on five phantom and ten human case datasets acquired in the supine position.RESULTS: For dynamic phantom validation, the EMT-SMC simulation method improved the tracking performance of the successfully registered bronchoscopic video frames by 12.7{\%} compared with a hybrid-based method. In comparisons between tracking results and ground truth, the accuracy of the EMT-SMC simulation method was 1.51 mm (positional error) and 5.44{\textdegree} (orientation error). During patient assessment, the SIFT-SMC simulation scheme was more stable or robust than a previous image-based approach for bronchoscope motion estimation, showing 23.6{\%} improvement of successfully tracked frames. Comparing the estimates of our method to ground truth, the position and orientation errors are 3.72 mm and 10.2{\textdegree}, while those of our previous image-based method were at least 7.77 mm and 19.3{\textdegree}. The computational times of our EMT- and SIFT-SMC simulation methods were 0.9 and 1.2 s per frame, respectively.CONCLUSION: The SMC simulation method was developed to model ambiguities that occur in bronchoscope tracking. This method more stably and accurately predicts the bronchoscope camera position and orientation parameters, reducing uncertainties due to problematic bronchoscopic video frames and airway deformation during intra-bronchoscopy navigation.}

Fibroblast growth factor/receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling is also involved in tumor progression and EMT in multiple tissues. Several studies have investigated the role of betaKlotho, an FGF/FGFR signaling co‑receptor in tumorigenesis. However, its role in PCa remains unknown. In the present study, the role of androgen in the EMT of PCa cells was examined by western blotting. The expression of betaKlotho was examined in prostate cells and PCa tissues by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The biological role of betaKlotho was revealed by a series of functional invitro and invivo studies. We determined that betaKlotho expression was significantly decreased in PCa tissues compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, and low betaKlotho expression was associated with a high Gleason score of PCa. betaKlotho overexpression inhibited the viability, migration, and androgen/AR‑associated EMT of PCa cells through the inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Notably, betaKlotho overexpression inhibited prostate tumor growth and EMT invivo. Knockdown of betaKlotho produced the opposite effects. In conclusion, betaKlotho inhibits EMT and plays a tumor‑suppressive role in PCa, linking FGF/FGFR/betaKlotho signaling to the regulation of PCa progression.}

During the last two decades, downsizing hospital bed capacity has been the strategy for cutting expenditure in the Swedish healthcare system. However, the lack of implementation of new and viable outpatient alternatives has led to a widespread overcrowding problem in Swedish hospitals and emergency departments. The present study was conducted as a survey in hospital wards at two emergency hospitals in southwestern Sweden. Study aims were to assess the causes of hospitalization and indications for continuing in-hospital care in hospitalized geriatric patients (>80 years). The study shows that a very small number of patients are admitted barely because of social factors; however, there is a significant group where hospitalization is due to both social and medical factors. A large group of hospitalized patients over 80 year (37{\%}) could receive their care outside the emergency hospital. About 30{\%} of hospitalized patients are waiting for planning, and the majority of them waiting for social action and planning. Older patients with multiple diseases require healthcare but not hospitalization to the present extent. We should focus on developing additional forms of healthcare since avoidable hospitalization is a high cost for the society, but above all a risk for the individual.}

The system should interact with existing hospital information systems, run on mobile computing devices (handheld computers) and be suitable for operation in weak-connectivity conditions (with unstable connections between mobile clients and a server).METHODS: The MET (Mobile Emergency Triage) system was designed following an extended client-server architecture. The client component, responsible for triage decision support, is built as a knowledge-based system, with domain ontology separated from generic problem solving methods and used for the automatic creation of a user interface.RESULTS: The MET system is well suited for operation in the Emergency Department of a hospital. The system's external interactions are managed by the server, while the MET clients, running on handheld computers are used by clinicians for collecting clinical data and supporting triage at the bedside. The functionality of the MET client is distributed into specialized modules, responsible for triaging specific types of acute pain presentations. The modules are stored on the server, and on request they can be transferred and executed on the mobile clients. The modular design provides for easy extension of the system's functionality. A clinical trial of the MET system validated the appropriateness of the system's design, and proved the usefulness and acceptance of the system in clinical practice.CONCLUSIONS: The MET system captures the necessary hospital data, allows for entry of patient information, and provides triage support. By operating on handheld computers, it fits into the regular emergency department workflow without introducing any hindrances or disruptions. It supports triage anytime and anywhere, directly at the point of care, and also can be used as an electronic patient chart, facilitating structured data collection.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For severe trauma patients, hemorrhage is the most common cause of medically preventable deaths. Early transfusion is beneficial to major hemorrhagic patients. However, the early supply of emergency blood products for major hemorrhagic patients is still a major problem in many areas. The aim of this study was to design and develop an unmanned emergency blood dispatch system for the fast delivery of blood resources and rapid emergency response to trauma events, especially those with mass hemorrhagic trauma patients and those occurred in remote areas.METHODS: Based on the process of emergency medical services for trauma patients, we introduced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and designed the main flowchart of the dispatch system, which combines an emergency transfusion prediction model and UAV-related dispatch algorithms to improve first aid efficiency and quality. The system identifies patients in need of emergency transfusion through a multidimensional prediction model. Then, by analyzing the blood center, hospitals and UAV stations nearby, the system recommends the patient's transfer destination for emergency transfusion and dispatch schemes of UAVs and trucks for a fast supply of blood products. Simulation experiments of urban and rural scenarios were conducted to evaluate the proposed system.RESULTS: The developed emergency transfusion prediction model of the proposed system achieves a higher AUROC value of 0.8453 than a classical transfusion prediction score. In the urban experiment, by adopting the proposed system, the average wait time per patient decreased from 32 to 18min, and the total time decreased from 42 to 29min. Owing to the combination of the prediction and the fast delivery function, the proposed system took 4 and 11min less wait time than the strategy with only the prediction function and the strategy with only the fast delivery function, respectively. In the rural experiment, for trauma patients requiring an emergency transfusion at 4 locations, the wait time for transfusion under the proposed system was 16.54, 17.08, 38.70 and 46.00min less than that under the conventional strategy. The health status-related score increased by 6.9{\%}, 0.9{\%}, 19.1{\%} and 36.7{\%}, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system works well with a faster blood supply speed for severe hemorrhagic patients and better health status. With the assistance of the system, emergency doctors at the scene of an injury are able to comprehensively analyze patients' status and the surrounding rescue conditions and then make decisions, especially when encountering mass casualties or casualties in remote areas.}

It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology. While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients. The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients. This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services. Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures. The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations. In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit colleagues. The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff. In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.}

 abstract     = {Importance: Millions of low-income children in the United States reside in substandard or unaffordable housing. Relieving these burdens may be associated with changes in asthma outcomes.Objectives: To examine whether participation in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) rental assistance programs is associated with childhood asthma outcomes and to examine whether associations varied by program type (public housing, multifamily housing, or housing choice vouchers).Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the nationally representative National Health Interview Survey linked to administrative housing assistance records from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2014. A total of 2992 children aged 0 to 17 years who were currently receiving rental assistance or would enter a rental assistance program within 2 years of survey interview were included. Data analysis was performed from January 15, 2018, to August 31, 2019.Exposures: Participation in rental assistance provided by HUD.Main Outcomes and Measures: Ever been diagnosed with asthma, 12-month history of asthma attack, and 12-month history of visiting an emergency department for the treatment of asthma among program participants vs those waiting to enter a program. Overall participation was examined, and participation in public or multifamily housing was compared with participation in housing choice vouchers.Results: This study included 2992 children who were currently participating in a HUD program or would enter a program within 2 years. Among children with an asthma attack in the past year, participation in a rental assistance program was associated with a reduced use of emergency departments for asthma of 18.2 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -29.7 to -6.6 percentage points). Associations were only found after entrance into a program, suggesting that they were not confounded by time-varying factors. Statistically significant results were found for participation in public or multifamily housing (percentage point change, -36.6; 95{\%} CI, -54.8 to -18.4) but not housing choice vouchers (percentage point change, -7.2; 95{\%} CI, -24.6 to 10.3). No statistically significant evidence of changes in asthma attacks was found (percentage point change, -2.7; 95{\%} CI, -12.3 to 7.0 percentage points). Results for asthma diagnosis were smaller and only significant at the 10{\%} level (-4.3; 95{\%} CI, -8.8 to 0.2 percentage points).Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with a recent asthma attack, rental assistance was associated with less emergency department use. These results may have important implications for the well-being of low-income families and health care system costs.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVES Firefighter (FF) is an occupation which needs high fitness abilities. However, most of Korean FFs in the capital city have relatively low fitness levels and they have difficulty participating in exercises owing to their emergency environments. Kinect-based mixed reality device (KMR) is a device that can deliver exercises with live visual feedbacks by detecting motions at any time while needing few human resources. Therefore, KMR could be an adequate tool for FFs to provide exercise. However, there are no studies that identified the reliability and validity. So, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the reliability and validity of KMR and the intensity of the fitness program for relatively low-fit FFs.METHODS Using a test-retest design, five male participants underwent three trials with 1wk washouts. The participants underwent 1 screening and 2 workout sessions. The fitness program using KMR last approximately 25 min. Intensity was measured using the heart rate (HR), rated perceived exertion (RPE), and finger-tip lactate. HR and RPE were measured before, during, and after the exercise using the Polar watch and Borg scale. Finger-tip lactate were measured before and after the exercise using Lactate Pro2. Cronbach alpha and Pearson correlation were determined for reliability and validity based on the HR and RPE.RESULTS Excellent reliability (Cronbach alpha: 0.967, 0.969) and strong correlation (r = .525 -- .814, .718 -- .958; very large) were observed with regard to the HR and RPE. Additionally, HR, RPE, and post-workout lactate showed a moderate-to-high intensity response in exercise program. Conclusions: The results suggest that KMR is a reliable and validate device to provide fitness programs and the fitness program designed for relatively low-fit FFs showed a ``moderate-to-high'' intensity response, which is an adequate physiological response for relatively low-fit Korean FFs.}

This study's primary aim was to investigate whether physiologic variables change with increasingly stressful simulations. Secondary aims include effect of stress on procedural competency and whether individuals recognize their experienced stress.METHODS: This was a single-center, mixed-method, simulation-based study. Participants completed three scenarios requiring resuscitation under increasingly stressful conditions. Wearable biometric devices recorded physiologic parameters. Subjects completed surveys assessing knowledge and perceived stress. Intubation success or failure was noted. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was used as a proxy for stress.RESULTS: Twelve participants completed the study. Survey analysis revealed progressive amplification of endorsement of affective states associated with stress. Median low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) ratio from scenario 1 (median=2.29, IQR=1.97, 3.91) was significantly lower than scenario 2 (median=4.7, IQR=2.32, 8.35, p=0.04) and scenario 3 (median=4.63, IQR=2.2, 7.43, p=0.04). Changes in HRV were noted during all scenarios irrespective of subjective self-assessment of stress. Procedural proficiency suffered during more stressful scenarios.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates alterations in subjective assessment and objective physiologic data in simulations with increasing stress. HRV is useful as a proxy for stress response and does not always correlate with perception.}

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerance, and safety of venlafaxine extended-release (XR) monotherapy in treating first-episode outpatients fulfilling the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder with associated painful physical symptoms. Of the 102 outpatients enrolled, 86 (84.3{\%}) completed the study. Venlafaxine XR treatment (75-225 mg/day) was followed by a significant decrease in the total scores for the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from baseline to the second weekend (t value=16.12, P<0.0001) and at every subsequent visit (weeks 4, 6, and 8, all P<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in the mean Visual Analog Scales for overall pain and the mean medical outcomes study pain measures from baseline to the second weekend (t value=14.99, P<0.0001; t value=12.59, P<0.0001) and at every visit (all P<0.0001). At the end of the eighth week, venlafaxine XR achieved response and remission rates of 68.6 and 40.2{\%}, respectively. The remission rate for pain responders (improvement in Visual Analog Scale overall pain from baseline to last observation ≥50{\%}) was significantly greater than that for pain nonresponders (56.1 vs. 20.0{\%}, P<0.0001). The most common (≥10{\%}) adverse events were nausea (31.4{\%}), dizziness (26.5{\%}), and somnolence (22.5{\%}). Venlafaxine XR is possibly an effective and safe option in the treatment of depression and associated painful physical symptoms.}

The objectives of these post hoc analyses were (1) to define a clinically meaningful response using novel efficacy analyses (including a responder analysis), and (2) to compare the efficacy of MP29-02 [a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP)] with commercially available FP, AZE and placebo in seasonal AR (SAR) patients, using these novel analyses.METHODS: 610 moderate-to-severe SAR patients (≥12 years old) were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-day, parallel-group trial. Change from baseline in the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 14 days was the primary outcome. Post hoc endpoints included the sum of nasal and ocular symptoms (rT7SS), efficacy by disease severity and by predominant nasal symptom, and a set of responder analyses.RESULTS: MP29-02 most effectively reduced rT7SS (relative greater improvement: 52{\%} to FP; 56{\%} to AZE) and both nasal and ocular symptoms irrespective of severity. More MP29-02 patients achieved a ≥30, ≥50, ≥60, ≥75 and ≥90{\%} rTNSS reduction, which occurred days faster than with either active comparator; MP29-02 alone was superior to placebo at the ≥60{\%} (or higher) threshold. One in 2 MP29-02 patients achieved a ≥50{\%} rTNSS reduction and 1 in 6 achieved complete/near-to-complete response. Only MP29-02 was consistently superior to placebo for all patients, whatever their predominant symptom.CONCLUSIONS: MP29-02 provided faster and more complete symptom control than first-line therapies. It was consistently superior irrespective of severity, response criteria or patient-type, and may be considered the drug of choice for moderate-to-severe AR. These measures define a new standard for assessing relevance in AR.}

Interest in the development of field portable monitoring devices has increased throughout the past decade. Herein we describe fabrication, characterization and performance of portable and printable enzyme biosensors based on functional enzyme-nanoparticle conjugates. We review specific physicochemical and surface properties of nanoparticles used as carriers and sensing components for the design of portable biosensors and describe the role of these parameters in enhancing the performance, stability and field operability of these devices. Assembly of enzyme-nanoparticle conjugates is also discussed with an overview of current and emerging techniques enabling large scale roll-to-roll fabrication and miniaturization, including screen-printing, inkjet and 3D printing methods and their integration in flexible, wearable and inexpensive point-of-use devices. Current status and implementation challenges are provided with examples of applications in the clinical, environmental, public safety and food monitoring fields.}

 abstract     = {Multiple mechanisms have been described for coordination of responses to the plant hormones auxin and brassinosteroids (Zhang et al., 2009). One unexplained phenomenon is the reliance of the auxin transcriptional response on a functional brassinosteroid pathway. In this study, we used luciferase reporters to interrogate the promoter of SMALL AUXIN-UP RNA15 (SAUR15), a well-characterized auxin and brassinosteroid early response gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). After identifying a minimal region sufficient for auxin response, we targeted predicted cis-regulatory elements contained within this sequence and found a critical subset required for hormone response. Specifically, reporter sensitivity to auxin treatment required two elements: a Hormone Up at Dawn (HUD)-type E-box and an AuxRE-related TGTCT element. Reporter response to brassinosteroid treatment relied on the same two elements. Consistent with these findings, the transcription factors BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-EMS SUPPESSOR1 and MONOPTEROS (MP)/ AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR5 (ARF5) showed enhanced binding to the critical promoter region containing these elements. Treatment with auxin or brassinosteroids could enhance binding of either transcription factor, and brassinosteroid enhancement of MP/ARF5 binding required an intact HUD element. Conservation of clustered HUD elements and AuxRE-related sequences in promoters of putative SAUR15 orthologs in a number of flowering plant species, in combination with evidence for statistically significant clustering of these elements across all Arabidopsis promoters, provided further evidence of the functional importance of coordinated transcription factor binding.}

However, due to the high noise in the deluge of data, effectively determining semantically relevant information can be difficult, further complicated by the changing definition of relevancy by each end user for different events. The majority of existing methods for short text relevance classification fail to incorporate users' knowledge into the classification process. Existing methods that incorporate interactive user feedback focus on historical datasets. Therefore, classifiers cannot be interactively retrained for specific events or user-dependent needs in real-time. This limits real-time situational awareness, as streaming data that is incorrectly classified cannot be corrected immediately, permitting the possibility for important incoming data to be incorrectly classified as well. We present a novel interactive learning framework to improve the classification process in which the user iteratively corrects the relevancy of tweets in real-time to train the classification model on-the-fly for immediate predictive improvements. We computationally evaluate our classification model adapted to learn at interactive rates. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models. In addition, we integrate our framework with the extended Social Media Analytics and Reporting Toolkit (SMART) 2.0 system, allowing the use of our interactive learning framework within a visual analytics system tailored for real-time situational awareness. To demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, we provide domain expert feedback from first responders who used the extended SMART 2.0 system.}

 abstract     = {Constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) variants have been involved in the expression of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin in prostate cancer (PCa). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. It remains unclear, whether N-cadherin gene (CDH2) is a direct transcriptional target of AR variants or whether the observed upregulation is due to indirect effects through additional regulatory factors. Moreover, the specific contribution of full-length AR and AR variants in N-cadherin regulation in PCa has never been explored deeply. To investigate this, we artificially mimicked the co-expression of AR variants together with a full-length AR and performed miRNA-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP assays. Our results were in favor of a direct AR variants action on CDH2. Our data also revealed a distinctive mode of action between full-length AR and AR variants to regulate N-cadherin expression. Both wild type AR and AR variants could interact with a regulatory element in intron 1 of CDH2. However, a higher histone H4 acetylation in this genomic region was only observed with AR variants. This suggests that full-length AR may play an occluding function to impede CDH2 upregulation. Our data further highlighted a negative effect of AR variants on the expression of the endogenous full-length AR in LNCaP. These differences in the mode of action of AR variants and full-length AR for the control of one key gene for prostate cancer progression could be worth considering for targeting AR variants in PCa.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: To establish the validity of sensor-based measures of work processes for predicting perceived mental and physical exertion of critical care nurses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated measures mixed-methods study in a surgical intensive care unit. Wearable and environmental sensors captured work process data. Nurses rated their mental (ME) and physical exertion (PE) for each four-hour block, and recorded patient and staffing-level workload factors. Shift was the grouping variable in multilevel modeling where sensor-based measures were used to predict nursing perceptions of exertion.RESULTS: There were 356 work hours from 89 four-hour shift segments across 35 bedside nursing shifts. In final models, sensor-based data accounted for 73{\%} of between-shift, and 5{\%} of within-shift variance in ME; and 55{\%} of between-shift, and 55{\%} of within-shift variance in PE. Significant predictors of ME were patient room noise (SS = 0.30, p < .01), the interaction between time spent and activity levels outside main work areas (SS = 2.24, p < .01), and the interaction between the number of patients on an insulin drip and the burstiness of speaking (SS = 0.19, p < .05). Significant predictors of PE were environmental service area noise (SS = 0.18, p < .05), and interactions between: entropy and burstiness of physical transitions (SS = 0.22, p < .01), time speaking outside main work areas and time at nursing stations (SS = 0.37, p < .001), service area noise and time walking in patient rooms (SS = -0.19, p < .05), and average patient load and nursing station speaking volume (SS = 0.30, p < .05).DISCUSSION: Analysis yielded highly predictive models of critical care nursing workload that generated insights into workflow and work design. Future work should focus on tighter connections to psychometric test development methods and expansion to a broader variety of settings and professional roles.CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-based measures are predictive of perceived exertion, and are viable complements to traditional task demand measures of workload.}

Renal sympathetic nerve activity is elevated in patients and experimental animals with CKD and contributes to renal interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy. However, the mechanisms underlying sympathetic overactivation in renal fibrosis remain unknown. Norepinephrine (NE), the main sympathetic neurotransmitter, was found to promote TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrotic gene expression in the human renal proximal epithelial cell line HK-2. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we identified that NE binds Galphaq-coupled alpha1-adrenoceptor (alpha1-AR) to enhance EMT of HK-2 cells by activating p38/Smad3 signaling. Inhibition of p38 diminished the NE-exaggerated EMT process and increased the fibrotic gene expression in TGF-beta1-treated HK-2 cells. Moreover, the pharmacological blockade of alpha1-AR reduced the kidney injury and renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse model by suppressing EMT in the kidneys. Thus, sympathetic overactivation facilitates EMT of renal epithelial cells and fibrosis via the alpha1-AR/p38/Smad3 signaling pathway, and alpha1-AR inhibition may be a promising approach toward treating renal fibrosis.}

This systematic review sought to explore this issue with the following objective: what admission alternatives are there for older patients and are they safe, effective and cost-effective? A secondary objective was to identify the characteristics of those older patients for whom the decision to admit to hospital may be unclear.DESIGN: Systematic review of controlled studies (April 2005-December 2016) with searches in Medline, Embase, Cinahl and CENTRAL databases. The protocol is registered at PROSPERO (CRD42015020371). Studies were assessed using Cochrane risk of bias criteria, and relevant reviews were assessed with the AMSTAR tool. The results are presented narratively and discussed.SETTING: Primary and secondary healthcare interface.PARTICIPANTS: People aged over 65 years at risk of an unplanned admission.INTERVENTIONS: Any community-based intervention offered as an alternative to admission to an acute hospital.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: Reduction in secondary care use, patient-related outcomes, safety and costs.RESULTS: Nineteen studies and seven systematic reviews were identified. These recruited patients with both specific conditions and mixed chronic and acute conditions. The interventions involved paramedic/emergency care practitioners (n=3), emergency department-based interventions (n=3), community hospitals (n=2) and hospital-at-home services (n=11). Data suggest that alternatives to admission appear safe with potential to reduce secondary care use and length of time receiving care. There is a lack of patient-related outcomes and cost data. The important features of older patients for whom the decision to admit is uncertain are: age over 75 years, comorbidities/multi-morbidities, dementia, home situation, social support and individual coping abilities.CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review describes and assesses evidence on alternatives to acute care for older patients and shows that many of the options available are safe and appear to reduce resource use. However, cost analyses and patient preference data are lacking.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Whereas the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis remains a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the emergence of AR mutations and splice variants as mechanisms underlying resistance to contemporary inhibitors of this pathway highlights the need for new therapeutic approaches to target this disease. Of significance in this regard is the considerable preclinical data, indicating that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may have utility in the treatment of CRPC. However, the results of clinical studies using HDAC inhibitors (directed against HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) in CRPC are equivocal, a result that some have attributed to their ability to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neuroendocrine differentiation. We posited that it might be possible to uncouple the beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors on AR signaling from their undesired activities by targeting specific HDACs as opposed to using the pan-inhibitor strategy that has been employed to date.METHODS: The relative abilities of pan- and selective-Class I HDAC inhibitors to attenuate AR-mediated target gene expression and proliferation were assessed in several prostate cancer cell lines. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown approaches were used to confirm the importance of of HDAC 1, 2, and 3 expression in these processes. Further, the ability of each HDAC inhibitor to induce the expression of EMT markers (RNA and protein) and EMT-like phenotype(s) (migration) were also assessed. The anti-tumor efficacy of a HDAC3-selective inhibitor, RGFP966, was compared to the pan-HDAC inhibitor Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) in the 22Rv1 xenograft model.RESULTS: Using genetic and pharmacological approaches we demonstrated that a useful inhibition of AR transcriptional activity, absent the induction of EMT, could be achieved by specifically inhibiting HDAC3. Significantly, we also determined that HDAC3 inhibitors blocked the activity of the constitutively active AR V7-splice variant and inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors expressing this protein.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide strong rationale for the near-term development of specific HDAC3 inhibitors for the treatment of CRPC.}

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of suppression, ammunition, and barrel length on AR-15 rifles.DESIGN: Sound levels were measured left/right of a user's head, and 1-m left of the muzzle, per MIL-STD-1474-D, under both unsuppressed and suppressed conditions.STUDY SAMPLE: Nine commercially available AR-15 rifles and 14 suppressors were used.RESULTS: Suppressors significantly decreased peak dB SPL at the 1-m location and the left ear location. However, under most rifle/ammunition conditions, levels remained above 140dB peak SPL near a user's right ear. In a subset of conditions, subsonic ammunition produced values near or below 140dB peak SPL. Overall suppression ranged from 7-32dB across conditions.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that (1) suppressors reduce discharge levels to 140dB peak SPL or below in only a subset of AR-15 conditions, (2) shorter barrel length and use of muzzle brake devices can substantially increase exposure level for the user, and (3) there are significant left/right ear sound pressure differences under suppressed conditions as a function of the AR-15 direct impingement design that must be considered during sound measurements to fully evaluate overall efficacy.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and use of a nature-based virtual reality (VR) experience among health care providers (HCP) during a pandemic.METHODS: Twenty-four frontline HCP participated in this crossover pilot where the viewing order of the experiences were randomized. All participants attended in-person consent, baseline, and end-of-study visits. The intervention consisted of viewing 2 nature-based scenes ("walk in the woods" and "forest of focus") through 3-D VR and with computer 4K graphic imagery. Randomization took place with regards to the viewing order (VR vs 4K computer video, scene 1 and 2). Outcomes measured were safety, acceptability and changes in intensity of anxiety feelings, resilience, emotional distress, cognitive function, and self-efficacy.RESULTS: Among the 26 HCP expressing interest in the study, 24 enrolled in this study. The majority were male (58.3{\%}), white (66.7{\%}) and of an average age of 46.3{\textpm}10.5years (standard deviation (SD)). End of the study survey showed that almost all participants (96{\%}) would participate in the study again and recommend it to others. Twenty-three of the 24 participants also felt relaxed after seeing the imagery. With respect to anxiety (as measured by the STAI Y1), the VR "walk in the woods" had the greatest reduction from pre to post (6.4 points, SD=5.98) followed by VR "forest of focus" (5.8 points, SD=9.29), computer screen "forest of focus" (5.0 points, SD=8.89), and computer screen "walk in the woods" (4.1 points, SD=6.22). All 4 sessions had a significant decrease in score from pre to post (P-values ≤.005), but there was no significant difference in the change from pre- to post-session between the 4 groups (P-value=.5835).CONCLUSION: The use of the VR among HCP has promise for reducing stress among health care providers during a high stress period, such as a pandemic but much larger studies are needed.}

 abstract     = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the development of severe lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, it has been reported that EMT involves complex metabolic reprogramming triggered by several factors including transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) and that monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1) plays an essential role in these metabolic changes. The aim of the present study was to clarify the functional expression of MCT1 during TGF-beta1-induced EMT in alveolar epithelial A549 cells. The transport function of MCT1 in A549 cells was examined using [3H]gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and [3H] lactic acid (LA) as substrates and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC), lactic acid, phloretin, and AR-C155858 (AR) as inhibitors of MCT1. EMT was induced by treating the cells with TGF-beta1. mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed using real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent GHB and LA uptake were observed in A549 cells. CHC, lactic acid, phloretin, and AR significantly inhibited the uptake of GHB in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that MCT1 is primarily responsible for transport of monocarboxylates such as GHB and LA in A549 cells. TGF-beta1 treatment significantly enhanced GHB and LA uptake as well as the mRNA and protein expression levels of MCT1 in A549 cells. These changes were neutralized by co-treatment with SB431542, an inhibitor for the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway. CHC and AR had no effect on TGF-beta1-induced EMT-related gene expression changes. Here, we have clearly characterized functional expression of MCT1 in A549 cells and have shown that MCT1 may be upregulated via the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway.}

 abstract     = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play an important role in cutaneous wound healing; however, the functional mechanisms involved in the healing process are poorly understood. A series of studies indicate that keratinocytes that migrate into the wound bed rely on an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process to initiate re-epithelialization. We therefore examined whether bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) could affect biological behavior and induce EMT-like characteristics in the human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) and in the immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT cells, and we investigated the signaling pathways of BMSC-mediated phenotypic changes. By assessing the expression of EMT-related markers including E-cadherin, alpha-SMA, and Snail family transcription factors by beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) blockage using ICI-118,551, a beta2-AR selective antagonist, or beta2-AR small interfering RNA (siRNA), we showed an involvement of beta2-AR signaling in the induction of EMT-like alterations in human keratinocytes in vitro. beta2-AR signaling also affected collective and individual cell migration in human keratinocyte cell lines, which was attenuated by administration of ICI-118,551. Treating the cells with BMSC-conditioned media (BMSC-CM) not only recapitulated the effect of isoproterenol (ISO) on cell migration but also induced the expression of beta2-AR and a panel of proteins associated with mesenchymal phenotype in HEKs and HaCaT cells. Similarly, a blockade of the beta2-AR by either ICI-118,551 or beta2-AR siRNAs reversed both responses of the epidermal keratinocyte cell lines relative to BMSC-CM exposure. These results were further verified in our vivo findings and indicated that the exogenous application of MSCs promoted cutaneous wound healing and endowed the keratinocytes surrounding the wound area with an increased migratory phenotype through activation of beta2-AR signaling. Our findings suggest a biochemical mechanism underlying the function of MSCs in wound re-epithelization, which provides a reliable theoretical basis for the wide application of MSCs in the treatment of chronic wounds.}

A randomized controlled trial assessed VR-JIT effectiveness for participants in individual placement and support (IPS), in which approximately 55{\%} of individuals with serious mental illness obtain employment.METHODS: Ninety participants with serious mental illness were randomly assigned to IPS+VR-JIT (N=54) or IPS as usual (N=36), completing pretest-posttest assessments and an employment evaluation at 9 months. Intent-to-treat chi-square analysis, multivariable logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and mixed-effects linear regressions were conducted. Fifty-one percent were IPS nonresponders (i.e., no employment within the first 90 days of IPS).RESULTS: IPS+VR-JIT participants did not have significantly higher employment rates, compared with IPS-as-usual participants (43{\%} versus 28{\%}). IPS nonresponders (N=46) in the IPS+VR-JIT group had greater odds of obtaining employment (odds ratio [OR]=5.82, p=0.014) and shorter time to employment (hazard ratio=2.70, p=0.044) compared with IPS nonresponders in the IPS-as-usual group. Intent-to-treat mixed-effects linear analyses indicated that IPS+VR-JIT, compared with IPS as usual, significantly improved interview skills (p=0.006), interview confidence (p=0.013), and interview anxiety (p=0.019).CONCLUSIONS: VR-JIT's potential benefits (increased employment in a shorter time) appeared to be specific to IPS nonresponders, whereas employment outcomes for recent IPS enrollees were not affected. VR-JIT could be a valuable resource for employment specialists to support IPS nonresponders, because 47{\%} of participants engaged in mock interview training with their specialist. Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness and implementation of VR-JIT among IPS nonresponders.}

We have developed, built, and tested a wearable monitor for real-time detection of toxic hydrocarbons and acids in the environment. The monitor is low-cost, accurate, and user friendly. In addition, it can communicate wirelessly with a cell phone in which the monitoring results can be processed, displayed, stored, and transmitted to a designated computer. We have validated the functions and performance of the monitor, and carried out field tests with workers involving waste management, fire overhaul, and floor-cleaning activities, as well as with first- and second-hand smokers. The averaged exposure levels are in agreement with those determined by the standard NIOSH methods. The monitor provides accurate and real-time exposure assessment for the workers involving different activities. The real-time and continuous monitoring capability makes it possible to correlate the exposure levels with different activities and changes in the microenvironments. The monitor provides unprecedented real-time information that will help advance occupational safety and environmental health studies. It may also be used to better protect workers from occupational overexposure to toxic molecules.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Renal dysfunction due to acute rejection (AR), acute tubular necrosis, or calcineurin inhibitors toxicity is related to development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) and graft survival. Determination of serum creatinine (sCr) displays poor sensitivity as a marker for early detection of graft dysfunction. Kidney biopsy is an accurate but invasive procedure for the diagnosis. The levels of urinary mRNA of genes that regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can reflect early damage and detect the development of IF/TA. Repeated studies of these genes can provide noninvasive information about the evolution of the graft, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationships between early and 1-year graft evolution in relation to gene expression of EMT biomarkers.METHODS: Seventy-one kidney transplant recipients were monitored during 1 year recording analytical, clinical, and histological (if available) data. We determined RNA gene expression of EMT, angiotensinogen, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta and bone morphogenetic patients 7 (BMP7).RESULTS: At 3 months, angiotensinogen (mean [standard deviation]), (2.42 [.66] versus 8.58 [3.24]; P = .017) and N-cadherin (0.59 [0.26] versus 3.15 [1.35]; P = .016) discriminate a good evolution from AR episodes BMP-7 discriminated a good evolution versus AR (0.72 [0.29] versus 4.53 [2.23]; P = .006) and delayed graft function versus AR (1.14 [0.79] versus 4.53 [2.23]; P = .049). After 1 year, the ratio TGF-beta/BMP7 discriminated patients with an sCr > 1.5 mg/dL (6614.6 [1063.6] versus 3378.7 [1019]; P = .034). There was a positive correlation between urinary and tissue TGF-beta [r = 59; P = .003].CONCLUSION: The expression of studied genes reverting EMT at 3 months postransplantation showed differences in initial graft evolution. At 1 year, the TGF-beta/BMP7 ratio suggested activation of EMT, possible early marker of renal dysfunction.}

We showed androgen induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AR-positive bladder cancer cells and promoted tumor metastasis in xenograft models. We subsequently identified that Slug was the mediator of EMT induced by androgen. Furthermore, upregulation of Slug was due to activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in response to androgen. Finally, expression of AR showed strong correlation with loss of E-cadherin, higher expression of Slug and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in bladder tumor tissues. Taken together, our results suggest AR signaling promotes bladder cancer metastasis through Slug mediated EMT.}

 abstract     = {The emerging role of stress-related signaling in regulating cancer development and progression has been recognized. However, whether stress serves as a mechanism to promote gastric cancer metastasis is not clear. Here, we show that the beta2-AR agonist, isoprenaline, upregulates expression levels of CD44 and CD44v8-10 in gastric cancer cells. CD44, a cancer stem cell-related marker, is expressed at high levels in gastric cancer tissues, which strongly correlates with the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated phenotypes both in vivo and in vitro. Combined with experimental observations in two human gastric cancer cell lines, we found that beta2-AR signaling can initiate EMT. It led to an increased expression of mesenchymal markers, such as alpha-SMA, vimentin, and snail at mRNA and protein levels, and conversely a decrease in epithelial markers, E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Isoprenaline stimulation of beta2-AR receptors activates the downstream target STAT3, which functions as a positive regulator and mediated the phenotypic switch toward a mesenchymal cell type in gastric cancer cells. Our data provide a mechanistic understanding of the complex signaling cascades involving stress-related hormones and their effects on EMT. In light of our observations, pharmacological interventions targeting beta2-AR-STAT3 signaling can potentially be used to ameliorate stress-associated influences on gastric cancer development and progression.}

A means to enhance heat dissipation capacity of individuals clad in PPE would be of benefit. The glabrous skin regions of the hands, face, and feet are portals for direct heat transfer between the body core and the external environment. The effects of PPE outerwear and palmar glabrous skin cooling on heat storage were assessed. Subjects engaged in fixed load treadmill exercise in a thermoneutral environment (Ta=20-24{\textdegree}C) or rested in a hot environment (45{\textpm}0.5{\textdegree}C). The use of PPE outerwear increased the rate of core temperature rise by five-fold during vigorous exercise. Palm cooling using a stationary water circulation system attenuated the rate of core temperature rise by 30-60{\%} during rest and light, moderate, and vigorous exercise while wearing PPE outerwear. However, the subjects were tethered to the system. A wearable cooling system was devised that allowed free range of motion and unrestricted mobility. The wearable system provided thermal benefits equivalent to the use of the tethering cooling system. With optimization, this wearable cooling technique could neutralize the negative thermoregulatory effects of wearing PPE while engaged in light workload activities such as those encountered by healthcare professionals working in infectious disease treatment centers. For individuals working at higher workloads, such as firefighters, a wearable glabrous skin-based cooling system could extend work bout duration as well as enhance heat loss during episodic recovery periods.}

Tumors eventually progress despite castration through a number of well-characterized mechanisms; however, little is known about what determines the magnitude of response to short-term pathway inhibition.METHODS: We evaluated a novel combination of AR-targeting therapies (degarelix, abiraterone, and bicalutamide) and noted that the objective patient response to therapy was highly variable. To investigate what was driving treatment resistance in poorly responding patients, as a secondary outcome we comprehensively characterized pre- and post-treatment samples using both whole-genome and RNA sequencing.RESULTS: We find that resistance following short-term treatment differs molecularly from typical progressive castration-resistant disease, associated with transcriptional reprogramming, to a transitional epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype rather than an upregulation of AR signaling. Unexpectedly, tolerance to therapy appears to be the default state, with treatment response correlating with the prevalence of tumor cells deficient for SNAI2, a key regulator of EMT reprogramming.CONCLUSION: We show that EMT characterizes acutely resistant prostate tumors and that deletion of SNAI2, a key transcriptional regulator of EMT, correlates with clinical response.}

To further comprehend the mechanisms by which PCA3 modulates LNCaP cell survival, we characterized the expression patterns of several cancer-related genes, including those involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and AR cofactors in response to PCA3 silencing. We also aimed to develop a strategy to stably silence PCA3. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down PCA3 in LNCaP cells. The expression of 84 cancer-related genes, as well as those coding for AR cofactors and EMT markers, was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). LNCaP-PCA3 silenced cells differentially expressed 16 of the 84 cancer genes tested, mainly those involved in gene expression control and cell signaling. PCA3 knockdown also induced the upregulation of several transcripts coding for AR cofactors and modulated the expression of EMT markers. LNCaP cells transduced with lentivirus vectors carrying an shRNA sequence targeting PCA3 stably downregulated PCA3 expression, causing a significant drop (60{\%}) in the proportion of LNCaP cells expressing the transgene. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that PCA3 silencing modulates the expression of key cancer-related genes, including those coding for AR cofactors and EMT markers. Transducing LNCaP cells with an shRNA sequence targeting PCA3 led to loss of viability of the cells, supporting the proposal of PCA3 knockdown as a putative therapeutic approach to inhibit PCa growth.}

Androgen receptors were expressed in 52.6{\%} of tumor specimens, suggesting their implication in the pathogenesis of this tumor. Our study's aim was to investigate the hypothetical scenario of an androgen refractory laryngeal carcinoma where androgen receptors can be activated by nodal molecules in the course of an Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon. In line with this we correlated AR expression with the expression of ILK, p-Akt, E-cadherin, beta-catenin in our sample as well as with tumor grade and TNM stage. A reverse correlation between nuclear AR and cytoplasmic ILK expression was evidenced, indicating an interaction of those molecules in laryngeal carcinoma. Finally in our material, in those carcinomas that were expressing ARs, stronger nuclear expression of the receptor was characterized by poorer cell differentiation and correlated with the acquisition of EMT features like E-cadherin loss and beta-catenin translocation raising a question whether activated ARs can drive an EMT procedure.}

Current studies may quote data that is outdated or based solely on patient self-report. The purpose of this work was to describe basic epidemiologic measures of office and ED visits for AR, AS, and CS between 1995 and 2007, and to analyze trends over time for each of these diseases.METHODS: Survey data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) were examined from 1995 to 2007 for AR, AS, and CS by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) code, using the STATA statistical package survey-specific commands to obtain appropriate estimates. Subgroup analyses were performed for age, sex (male and female), race (white and black), and region. Logistic regression was used in order to investigate the predictors mentioned above in a multivariate model, and to analyze trends over time.RESULTS: For AR, there has been an increase in visits in both the office and ED settings between 1995 and 2007. For CS, there has been a decrease in the proportion of both office and ED visits over this time period, as well as in the visit rate. For CS office visits, there has been an increase in the total number of visits. For AS, descriptive data show an increase in both the total number and proportion of office visits, but logistic regression did not validate these findings. There has been a decrease in ED visits for AS. Age, sex, race, and region have differing effects on each these diseases, and these factors appear to be setting-dependent as well.CONCLUSION: While regression did not show statistically significant changes for AS, the odds ratio along with the number and proportion of visits suggests that an increase for AS at a similar rate of AR is possible, lending support to a relationship between these disease processes. The relatively small increase in the prevalence of AR in the United States when compared with the worldwide increase in developing countries suggests that the hygiene theory and environmental factors play a leading role in the development of AR. The relative decrease in the prevalence of CS may be the result of successful medical therapy with the increased use of nasal steroids and nasal saline irrigation.}

In this review, we discuss our current understanding of FOXA1 regulation of prostatic and non-prostatic AR-chromatin targeting. We present an updated model wherein FOXA1:AR equilibrium in the nuclei defines prostatic AR binding profile, which is perturbed in prostate cancer with FOXA1 and/or AR de-regulation. Finally, we discuss recent efforts in exploring new horizons of AR-independent functions of FOXA1 in prostate cancer and interesting directions to pursue in future studies.}

This study revealed that an EMT inducer (TGF-beta) induced full-length androgen receptor (AR) and AR variant expression. In addition, a highly invasive clone showed augmented full-length AR and AR variant expression as well as acquisition of castration resistance. Conversely, full-length AR and AR as well as Twist1 and mesenchymal molecules variant expression were up-regulated in castration-resistant LNCaP xenograft. Finally, TGF-beta inhibitor suppressed Twist1 and AR expression as well as prostate cancer growth combined with castration.

Data were recorded from a Laerdal Resusci Anne Skillreporter manikin. A simulated emergency medical dispatcher, contacted by cell phone, delivered standardized instructions. Primary outcome measures included chest compression rate, depth, and the proportion of compressions without error, with correct hand position, adequate depth, and total release. Time was measured in two distinct ways: time required for initiation of CPR and total amount of time hands were off the chest during CPR. Proportions were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum tests and time variables with ANOVA. All tests used a two-sided alpha-level of 0.05.RESULTS: Two hundred and fifteen subjects were randomized-107 in the "put the phone down" instruction group and 108 in the group without "put the phone down" instructions. The groups were comparable across demographic and experiential variables. The additional instruction to "put the phone down" had no effect on the proportion of compressions administered without error, with the correct depth, and with the correct hand position. Likewise, "put the phone down" did not affect the average compression depth, the average compression rate, the total hands-off-chest time, or the time to initiate chest compressions. A statistically significant, yet trivial, effect was found in the proportion of compressions with total release of the chest wall.CONCLUSIONS: Instructions to "put the phone down" had no effect on the quality of bystander initiated dispatcher-assisted CPR in this trial.}

Traditionally, the treatment goal for GAD has been the attainment of a treatment response, clinically defined as a 40{\%} to 50{\%} symptomatic improvement relative to baseline. However, there is growing consensus among clinical psychiatrists that the treatment goal should be remission, a virtually asymptomatic state that corresponds to a score of < or = 7 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) or a > or = 70{\%} symptomatic improvement from baseline. Venlafaxine extended release (XR), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the first pharmacotherapeutic agent to be indicated for both depression and GAD. This article reviews the efficacy data from several short- and long-term placebo-controlled studies of venlafaxine conducted to evaluate the potential of this agent to facilitate remission. Total scores on the HAM-A and the Clinical Global Impressions scale were used as the primary variables; scores for the HAM-A psychic and somatic anxiety factors and for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale were used as secondary variables. Venlafaxine XR showed a substantial effect size in the individual HAM-A items of worry, anxiety, and behavior at interview. The pooled analysis of 2 long-term studies indicated that the scores of venlafaxine remitters separated from those of responders by the second month, resulting in an overall increase in remitters. The results of these studies demonstrate the strong potential of venlafaxine XR in facilitating remission in GAD.}

Data of the patient's self care needs were collected by interviews, assessment of self care status and need of treatment. The patients could be divided into three groups depending on type of discharge. Group A (n = 27) discharged home, group B (n = 7) discharged to geriatric clinic and group C (n = 15) discharged and in need of further care and social services. Criteria indicating the patients further assistance from the community were in group C (medical- and orthopaedic wards) deficit in daily living activities and locomotion. Group B had an increased need of support from the physiotherapist and the occupational therapist, in locomotion as well as daily living activities The physician's assessment showed that the criteria behind the decision "no further medical treatment appropriate" and "ready for discharge" were not related to medical impairment but to lack of self care, need of care, rehabilitation and social services.}

Complications analysed included bronchoaspiration, pneumothorax, skin lesions, inability to manage secretions, eye irritations, deteriorating level of consciousness, gastric distension, and excessive air losses around the mask.RESULTS: Of 387 patients, 194 (50.1{\%}) were treated in ICU, 121 (31.3{\%}) in ED, 38 (9.8{\%}) postsurgery, and 34 (8.8{\%}) in general wards. Regression analysis, adjusted for APACHE score and NIV indication, showed 3.3 times greater risk of NIV failure (95{\%} CI [1.2-9.2]) in a university-hospital ICU with <50 NIV cases/year, compared to a community hospital ICU. In ICUs and general wards, NIV was suspended in 12{\%} of patients due to interface intolerance. Acute-on-chronic lung diseases (ACLD) had lower risk of NIV failure (OR 0.2 [95{\%} CI 0.06-0.69]) and lack of humidification was not associated with treatment failure (OR 0.2 [95{\%} CI 0.1-0.4]). Poor secretion management was linked to pneumonia (OR 2.5 [95{\%} CI 1.1-5.9]) and early weaning/extubation (OR 3.3 [95{\%} CI 1.2-8.9]). Interface intolerance was associated with conventional ICU ventilators (OR 4.4 [95{\%} CI 2.1-9.2]) and nasal skin lesions with excessive air losses (OR 2.4 [95{\%} CI 1.1-5.3]), especially with oronasal masks (OR 3.5 [95{\%} CI 1.1-11.3]).CONCLUSIONS: Acute respiratory failure patients with pneumonia admitted to general wards had increased interface intolerance and NIV failure. Rotating mask types could improve NIV success in any unit administering this therapy.}

 abstract     = {Metastasis is a primary reason related to the mortality of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. A program called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to play a critical role in promoting metastasis in epithelium-derived carcinoma. During EMT, epithelial cancer cells acquire motile mesenchymal phenotypes and detach from primary tumors. Recent lines of evidence have suggested that EMT confers cancer cells with tumor-initiating ability. Therefore, selective targeting of EMT would lead to the development of effective therapeutic agents. In this study, using a chemical biology approach, we identified isoxsuprine, a beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) agonist as a low-molecular-weight compound that interferes with the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes of oral cancer cells. Treatment of multiple types of oral cancer cells with isoxsuprine led to the downregulation of mesenchymal cell markers that was accompanied by reduced cell motility. Similar inhibitory effects were also observed for isoprenaline, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonist. In addition, inhibition of cell migration upon treatment with isoxsuprine was reverted by a non-selective beta-AR antagonist, propranolol, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system-mediated deletion of the beta2-AR gene, suggesting that the effects exerted by isoxsuprine involved signals mediated by beta2-AR. In addition, in a subcutaneous xenograft model of oral cancer cells, the administration of isoxsuprine effectively suppressed primary tumor growth, suggesting beta2-AR signals to be a promising cancer therapeutic target for treatment of OSCC.}

Metal detector is an equipment, which measures a change in inductance of a coil when an electroconductive material is placed near it and produces an audio-visual signal. The present study was conducted to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of HMD in the local Pediatric population.METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted in the pediatric emergency department among children presenting with history of foreign body ingestion. The outcome measured was presence or absence of metallic foreign body detected on handheld metal detector examination.RESULTS: During the study period, 36 patients with history of foreign body ingestion presented to the emergency department. Among these, 28 were metallic foreign body ingestions. Coins were the most common type of foreign body ingested. Among the metallic foreign bodies ingested, all the coins were accurately identified by the handheld metal detector. Non-coin metallic foreign bodies like metallic screw, needle and stapler pin were not identified by the handheld metal detector.CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that handheld metal detector can be safely and reliably used as a screening tool in the process of detecting ingested coins. The plain radiograph still appears to be superior as it accurately localizes sharp metallic objects as well as cell batteries (button batteries) which need to be detected early and removed in order to prevent complications. Handheld metal detector is an effective tool that can be used in the follow up of patients to confirm whether the coin like metallic foreign body has been expelled. Handheld metal detector examination is more sensitive than traditional X-ray examination to detect radiolucent metallic foreign bodies like aluminium.}

To date, no predictive factors have been clearly correlated with long-term response to anti-HER2 agents.METHODS: 54 HER2+MBC patients treated with HER2 targeted therapy as first line treatment were analysed: 40 with a time to progression longer than 3years in Long Responders (LR) group and 14 with a progression disease within one year of anti-HER2 therapy in a control group named Early Progressors (EP). The expression of 770 genes and 13 molecular pathways were evaluated using Nanostring PanCancer pathway panel performed on FFPE BC tissues.RESULTS: Considering baseline patients and tumor characteristics, EP women had more CNS spread and more metastatic burden of disease compared to LR (p>0.05). Gene expression analysis identified 30 genes with significantly different expression in the two cohorts; five were driver genes (BRCA1, PDGFRA, AR, PHF6 and MSH2). The majority of these genes were over-expressed, mainly in LR patients, and encoded growth factors, pro- or anti-inflammatory interleukins and DNA repair factors. Only four genes were down regulated, all in EP group (TNFSF10, CACNG1, IL20RB and BRCA1). Most of these genes were involved in MAPK and PI3K pathways. MAPK pathway was differently expressed between LR and EP (p=0.05). PI3K was the only pathway overexpressed in EP patients.CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome expression analysis comparing LR vs. EP identified a group of genes that may predict more favourable long-term outcomes. Up-regulation of MAPK and down-regulation of PI3K pathway could be a positive predictive factors. Further clinical implications are warranted.ABBREVIATIONS: BC: breast cancer; MBC: metastatic breast cancer; LR: long responder; EP: early progressor; FFPE: formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded; CNS: central nervous system; PFS: progression free survival; OS: overall survival.}

Recently, landmark molecular features have been reported for CRPC, including the expression of constitutively active AR variants that lack the ligand-binding domain. Besides their role in CRPC, AR variants lead to the expression of genes involved in tumor progression. However, little is known about the specificity of their mode of action compared with that of wild-type AR (AR-WT). We performed AR transcriptome analyses in an androgen-dependent PCa cell line as well as cross-analyses with publicly available RNA-seq datasets and established that transcriptional repression capacity that was marked for AR-WT was pathologically lost by AR variants. Functional enrichment analyses allowed us to associate AR-WT repressive function to a panel of genes involved in cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. So, we postulate that a less documented AR-WT normal function in prostate epithelial cells could be the repression of a panel of genes linked to cell plasticity and that this repressive function could be pathologically abrogated by AR variants in PCa.}

N and E were assessed using the NEO PI-R.RESULTS: Higher N was associated with lower DBP and TPRI reactivity during MA as compared to lower N, but higher TPRI reactivity during AR. Lower E scores were associated with heightened CVR while higher E scores were associated with lower CVR. For SBP and HR, E was associated with a reduction in reactivity across tasks; whereas, for DBP and TPRI this reduction was found only during AR.CONCLUSION: In this population, N had differential effects on CVR depending upon the nature of the stress task, cognitive or emotional. However, higher E was consistently linked to lower CVR during stress tasks and appeared to influence how individuals express and cope with anger.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic processes in the emergency department (ED) involve multiple interactions among individuals who interface with information systems to access and record information. A better understanding of diagnostic processes is needed to mitigate errors. This paper describes a study protocol to map diagnostic processes in the ED as a foundation for developing future error mitigation strategies.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study of an adult and a paediatric academic ED uses a prospective mixed methods case study design informed by an ED-specific diagnostic decision-making model (the modified ED-National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) model) and two cognitive theories (dual process theory and distributed cognition). Data sources include audio recordings of patient and care team interactions, electronic health record data, observer field notes and stakeholder interviews. Multiple qualitative analysis methods will be used to explore diagnostic processes in situ, including systems information flow, human-human and human-system interactions and contextual factors influencing cognition. The study has three parts. Part 1 involves prospective field observations of patients with undifferentiated symptoms at high risk for diagnostic error, where each patient is followed throughout the entire care delivery process. Part 2 involves observing individual care team providers over a 4-hour window to capture their diagnostic workflow, team coordination and communication across multiple patients. Part 3 uses interviews with key stakeholders to understand different perspectives on the diagnostic process, as well as perceived strengths and vulnerabilities, in order to enrich the ED-NASEM diagnostic model.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved this study, HUM00156261. This foundational work will help identify strengths and vulnerabilities in diagnostic processes. Further, it will inform the future development and testing of patient, provider and systems-level interventions for mitigating error and improving patient safety in these and other EDs. The work will be disseminated through journal publications and presentations at national and international meetings.}

 abstract     = {Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. Antidepressant drugs are the preferred choice for treatment; however, treatment response is often variable. Several studies in major depression have implicated a role of the serotonin receptor gene (HTR2A) in treatment response to antidepressants. We tested the hypothesis that the genetic polymorphism rs7997012 in the HTR2A gene predicts treatment outcome in GAD patients treated with venlafaxine XR. Treatment response was assessed in 156 patients that participated in a 6-month open-label clinical trial of venlafaxine XR for GAD. Primary analysis included Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) reduction at 6 months. Secondary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) score at 6 months. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between groups using chi(2) contingency analysis. The frequency of the G-allele differed significantly between responders (70{\%}) and nonresponders (56{\%}) at 6 months (P=0.05) using the HAM-A scale as outcome measure. Similarly, using the CGI-I as outcome, the G-allele was significantly associated with improvement (P=0.01). Assuming a dominant effect of the G-allele, improvement differed significantly between groups (P=0.001, odds ratio=4.72). Similar trends were observed for remission although not statistically significant. We show for the first time a pharmacogenetic effect of the HTR2A rs7997012 variant in anxiety disorders, suggesting that pharmacogenetic effects cross diagnostic categories. Our data document that individuals with the HTR2A rs7997012 single nucleotide polymorphism G-allele have better treatment outcome over time. Future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to further characterize this effect in treatment response to antidepressants in GAD.}

 abstract     = {Skeletal muscle is considered as a near-constant volume system, and the contractions of the muscle are related to the changes in tissue thickness. Assessment of the skeletal muscle contractile parameters such as maximum contraction thickness ( T h ), contraction time ( T c ), contraction velocity ( V c ), sustain time ( T s ), and half-relaxation ( T r ) provides valuable information for various medical applications. This paper presents a single-element wearable ultrasonic sensor (WUS) and a method to measure the skeletal muscle contractile parameters in A-mode ultrasonic data acquisition. The developed WUS was made of double-layer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric polymer films with a simple and low-cost fabrication process. A flexible, lightweight, thin, and small size WUS would provide a secure attachment to the skin surface without affecting the muscle contraction dynamics of interest. The developed WUS was employed to monitor the contractions of gastrocnemius (GC) muscle of a human subject. The GC muscle contractions were evoked by the electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) at varying EMS frequencies from 2 Hz up to 30 Hz. The tissue thickness changes due to the muscle contractions were measured by utilizing a time-of-flight method in the ultrasonic through-transmission mode. The developed WUS demonstrated the capability to monitor the tissue thickness changes during the unfused and fused tetanic contractions. The tetanic progression level was quantitatively assessed using the parameter of the fusion index (FI) obtained. In addition, the contractile parameters ( T h , T c , V c , T s , and T r ) were successfully extracted from the measured tissue thickness changes. In addition, the unfused and fused tetanus frequencies were estimated from the obtained FI-EMS frequency curve. The WUS and ultrasonic method proposed in this study could be a valuable tool for inexpensive, non-invasive, and continuous monitoring of the skeletal muscle contractile properties.}

 abstract     = {Taxane-based chemotherapy is an effective treatment for castration-resistant-prostate cancer (CRPC) via stabilization of microtubules. Previous studies identified that the inhibitory effect of microtubule-targeting chemotherapy on androgen receptor (AR) activity was conferred by interfering with AR intracellular trafficking. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of AR was identified as a tubulin-interacting domain that can be effectively targeted by the novel small molecule inhibitor, EPI. Taken together this evidence provided the rationale that targeting AR nuclear translocation and activity via a combination of an antagonist of the AR NTD and taxane-based chemotherapy may enhance the therapeutic response in CRPC. The present study investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of a combination of EPI with Docetaxel chemotherapy, in cell models of CRPC, harboring the AR splice variants in addition to the full length AR. Our findings demonstrate that there was no significant effect on the androgen-mediated nuclear transport of AR variants and AR transcriptional activity by Docetaxel. The therapeutic response to Docetaxel was enhanced by inhibition of the NTD of AR (by EPI) through cycling of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) to mesenchymal-epithelial-transition (MET) among prostate cancer epithelial cells. These results support that transient "programming" of EMT by the AR NTD inhibitor, potentially drives the sensitivity of prostate tumors with differential distribution of AR variants to microtubule-targeting chemotherapy. This study is of major significance in dissecting mechanisms to overcome taxane resistance in advanced CRPC.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Recombinant teriparatide, a bone anabolic agent, is given to treatment-naive and pre-treated patients with severe osteoporosis, but few data exist comparing the response to teriparatide in these groups. EUROFORS (the EUROpean study of FORSteo) enrolled postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis who were either treatment-naive or had prior antiresorptive (AR) treatment with or without documented inadequate clinical response. The objective of the secondary analysis described here was to evaluate the interim bone mineral density (BMD) response in these groups after one year of open-label teriparatide therapy.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis who enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial received open-label teriparatide 20 g/day for the first year. With respect to their prior osteoporosis treatment history, they were retrospectively allocated to one of three groups: treatment-naive (n = 204), prior treatment with an antiresorptive drug (AR-pretreated) (n = 240), or prior antiresorptive treatment with inadequate response (inadequate AR-responders) (n = 421). BMD was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.RESULTS: Lumbar spine BMD increased from baseline (p < 0.001) in the three groups (mean, 95{\%} CI); treatment-naive: 8.4{\%} (7.4{\%}, 9.3{\%}); AR-pretreated: 7.1{\%} (6.3{\%}, 7.9{\%}); inadequate AR-responders: 6.2{\%} (5.6{\%}, 6.9{\%}). Total hip BMD increased from baseline in the treatment-naive (p < 0.001): 1.8{\%} (1.1{\%}, 2.5{\%}) but did not change in the AR-pretreated: 0.4{\%} (-0.2{\%}, 1.1{\%}) or inadequate AR-responders: -0.3{\%} (-0.9{\%}, 0.2{\%}). Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the three groups.CONCLUSION: One year of teriparatide significantly (p < 0.001) increased spine BMD in all groups, and total hip BMD in the treatment-naive group. Because of the limitations of this interim analysis (most importantly, the short duration of treatment and lack of a control group), further study is needed to determine the optimal treatment duration to reach the potential BMD gains at the proximal femur in patients with prior antiresorptive drug use (mostly bisphosphonates).CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, nct00191425.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Sustained Acoustic Medicine (SAM) is an emerging, non-invasive, non-narcotic, home-use ultrasound therapy for the daily treatment of joint pain. The aim of this multi-site clinical study was to examine the efficacy of long-duration continuous ultrasound combined with a 1{\%} diclofenac ultrasound gel patch in treating pain and improving function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.METHODS: The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) were followed. Thirty-two (32) patients (18-males, 14-females) 54 years of average age with moderate to severe knee pain and radiographically confirmed knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade II/III) were enrolled for treatment with the SAM device and diclofenac patch applied daily to the treated knee. SAM ultrasound (3 MHz, 0.132 W/cm2, 1.3 W) and 6 grams of 1{\%} diclofenac were applied with a wearable device for 4 hours daily for 1 week, delivering 18,720 Joules of ultrasound energy per treatment. The primary outcome was the daily change in pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS 0-10), which was assessed prior to intervention (baseline, day 1), before and after each daily treatment, and after 1 week of daily treatment (day 7). Rapid responders were classified as those patients exhibiting greater than a 1-point reduction in pain following the first treatment. Change in Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Questionnaire (WOMAC) score from baseline to day 7 was the secondary functional outcome measure. Additionally, a series of daily usability and user experience questions related to devising ease of use, functionality, safety, and effectiveness, were collected. Data were analyzed using t-tests and repeated measure ANOVAs.RESULTS: The study had a 94{\%} retention rate, and there were no adverse events or study-related complaints across 224 unique treatment sessions. Rapid responders included 75{\%} of the study population. Patients exhibited a significant mean NRS pain reduction over the 7-day study of 2.06-points (50{\%}) for all subjects (n=32, p<0.001) and 2.96-points (70{\%}) for rapid responders (n=24, p<0.001). The WOMAC functional score significantly improved by 351 points for all subjects (n=32, p<0.001), and 510 points for rapid responders (n=24, p<0.001). Over 95{\%} of patients found the device safe, effective and easy to use, and would continue treatment for their knee OA symptoms.CONCLUSION: Sustained Acoustic Medicine combined with 1{\%} topical diclofenac rapidly reduced pain and improved function in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis-related knee pain. The clinical findings suggest that this treatment approach may be used as a conservative, non-invasive treatment option for patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additional research is warranted on non-weight bearing joints of the musculoskeletal system as well as different topical drugs that could benefit from improved localized delivery.Clinical Trial Registry Number: (NCT04391842).}

 abstract     = {Fibroblasts are abundantly present in the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME), including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which play a key role in cancer development. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is the main driver of prostate cancer (PCa) progression, and stromal cells in the TME also express AR. High-grade tumor and poor clinical outcome are associated with low AR expression in the TME, which suggests a protective role of AR signaling in the stroma against PCa development. However, the mechanism of this relation is not clear. In this study, we isolated AR-expressing CAF-like cells. Testosterone (R1881) exposure did not affect CAF-like cell morphology, proliferation, or motility. PCa cell growth was not affected by culturing in medium from R1881-exposed CAF-like cells; however, migration of PCa cells was inhibited. AR chromatin immune precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed and motif search suggested that AR in CAF-like cells bound the chromatin through AP-1-elements upon R1881 exposure, inducing enhancer-mediated AR chromatin interactions. The vast majority of chromatin binding sites in CAF-like cells were unique and not shared with AR sites observed in PCa cell lines or tumors. AR signaling in CAF-like cells decreased expression of multiple cytokines; most notably CCL2 and CXCL8 and both cytokines increased migration of PCa cells. These results suggest direct paracrine regulation of PCa cell migration by CAFs through AR signaling.}

The potential for 2 different referral models introduced in 2 urban hospitals was assessed, as well as the suitability of this measure.PATIENTS AND METHOD: After triage assessment, patients with minor complaints were identified. ED from Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB) proposed that these patients should be referred to a hospital affiliated off-site clinic, whereas ED from Hospital Mutua de Terrassa (HMT) tried to refer such patients to their primary care setting. Within a year, we assessed on both ED the following items: number of arrivals, percentage of proposed referrals (PR), percentage of accepted referrals (AR), percentage of carried-out referrals (CR: patients who, once discharged, really attended the other setting), and percentage of returned referrals (RR) to the ED, as well as return reasons, and the percentage of returned patients finally admitted. The degree of patient satisfaction was evaluated by means of a telephone survey.RESULTS: From both ED, 44,764 arrivals and 7,297 (16.3{\%}) PR were registered. The percentage of AR and CR was 94.3{\%} and 75.3{\%}, respectively. The percentage of PR from HMT was higher (18.7{\%} vs 13.1{\%}; p < 0.001), yet HCB obtained a greater percentage of AR (98.9{\%} vs 92{\%}, p < 0.001) and CR (93.7{\%} vs 65{\%}; p < 0.001). The percentage of RR from both ED was 1.5{\%} (2.8{\%} vs 0.4{\%}; p < 0.001). Among returned patients, 12 of them (0.17{\%} respect to AR) were finally admitted. Only 41{\%} of patients who were found to be eligible for direct discharge would have agreed with being referred to another clinical setting, but after the experience, up to 93{\%} of them said they would go through it again. HMT gave referral information to patients faster than HCB (p < 0.05), but HCB got a better model evaluation (p < 0.01), a greater medical complaint solution (p < 0.05), and generated a smaller number of subsequent consultations (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: After a rapid triage assessment, a percentage of patients arriving on EDs may be directly and safely discharged and referred to other clinical settings. This is achieved by both proposed models without additional risks for patients. However, patients feel more satisfied with an hospital-affiliated off-site clinic instead of their primary care setting.}

We recruited participants through professional listservs, social media, and email invitations sent to healthcare professionals. We analyzed interview transcripts using inductive thematic analysis and interviewed participants until we achieved thematic saturation. We finalized themes through a consensus-building process.RESULTS: We conducted interviews with 12 prescribing providers and 12 registered nurses. Six themes were identified related to EHR factors perceived to contribute to documentation burden including lack of advanced EHR capabilities, absence of EHR optimization for clinicians, poor user interface design, hindered communication, increased manual work, and added workflow blockages, and five themes associated with cognitive load. Two themes emerged in the relationship between workflow fragmentation and EHR documentation burden: underlying sources and adverse consequences.DISCUSSION: Obtaining further stakeholder input and consensus is essential to determine whether these perceived burdensome EHR factors could be extended to broader contexts and addressed through optimizing existing EHR systems alone or through a broad overhaul of the EHR's architecture and primary purpose.CONCLUSION: While most clinicians perceived that the EHR added value to patient care and care quality, our findings underscore the importance of designing EHRs that are in harmony with ED clinical workflows to alleviate the clinician documentation burden.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: In peacetime, it is challenging for Army Forward Resuscitative Surgical Teams (FRST) to maintain combat readiness as trauma represents <0.5{\%} of military hospital admissions and not all team members have daily clinical responsibilities. Military surgeon clinical experience has been described, but no data exist for other members of the FRST. We test the hypothesis that the clinical experience of non-physician FRST members varies between active duty (AD) and Army reservists (AR).METHODS: Over a 3-year period, all FRSTs were surveyed at one civilian center.RESULTS: Six hundred and thirteen FRST soldiers were provided surveys and 609 responded (99.3{\%}), including 499 (81.9{\%}) non-physicians and 110 (18.1{\%}) physicians/physician assistants. The non-physician group included 69{\%} male with an average age of 34{\textpm}11 years and consisted of 224 AR (45{\%}) and 275 AD (55{\%}). Rank ranged from Private to Colonel with officers accounting for 41{\%}. For AD vs. AR, combat experience was similar: 50{\%} vs. 52{\%} had ≥1 combat deployment, 52{\%} vs. 60{\%} peri-deployment patient load was trauma-related, and 31{\%} vs. 32{\%} had ≥40 patient contacts during most recent deployment (all P> .15). However, medical experience differed for AD and AR: 18{\%} vs. 29{\%} had>15 years of experience in practice and 4{\%} vs. 17{\%} spent >50{\%} of their time treating critically injured patients (all P<.001). These differences persisted across all specialties, including perioperative nurses, certified registered nurse anesthetists, operating room (OR) techs, critical-care nurses, emergency room (ER) nurses, licensed practical nurse (LPN), and combat medics.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of clinical practice patterns in AD vs. AR, non-physician members of Army FRSTs. In concordance with previous studies of military surgeons, FRST non-physicians seem to be lacking clinical experience as well. To maintain readiness and to provide optimal care for our injured warriors, the entire FRST, not just individuals, should embed within civilian centers.}

We use a design probe coupling mobile, cloud, and immersive analytics components to guide interviews with ten experts from five domains to explore how visual analytics could support data collection and analysis needs in the field. The results identify shortcomings of current approaches and target scenarios and design considerations for future field analysis systems. We embody these findings in FieldView, an extensible, open-source prototype designed to support critical use cases for situated field analysis.

Overall 80.5{\%} of admissions were considered to be necessary on medical grounds by the consultants at the time of discharge. Parental assessment of severity of illness and need for admission correlated well with that of the doctors. Fifty two per cent of all admissions took place though the accident and emergency department, and although a higher number of these were from disadvantaged families these were equally appropriate on medical grounds to those sent for admission by the general practitioner. Altogether 26.5{\%} of admissions were for less than 24 hours and half of these were judged to be unnecessary. Implications for the organisation of inpatient care are discussed.}

Here we hypothesize that aberrant activation of autophagy and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are the leading cause of DBP-related hypospadias. Pregnant rats received DBP orally at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day during gestational days 14-18. In DBP-induced hypospadiac male offspring, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and Western blot showed increased expression of autophagy and EMT markers in genital tubercle (GT) tissue compared to the control. In addition, lower testosterone levels and androgen receptor (AR) expression in GT tissue were detected. In vitro studies revealed that impaired AR signaling was involved in DBP-induced autophagy and autophagy activation furthermore promoted EMT in urethral epithelial cells. DBP combined with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, reduced the expression of EMT markers compared with DBP treatment alone, while DBP combined with the autophagy inducer rapamycin elevated the expression of EMT markers. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway inhibitor CQ but not proteasome inhibitor MG-132 rescued the decrease of E-cadherin after DBP treatment, which indicated autophagy-induced E-cadherin degradation contributes to DBP-related EMT. Taken together, our findings show that prenatal exposure to DBP induces abnormal autophagy and EMT that may play important roles in hypospadias development.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of police, emergency department, and ambulance records in describing motor vehicle crash (MVC) characteristics when compared with a crash investigation report (CIR).METHODS: This study was a retrospective record review. Sixty-three motor vehicle crash (MVC) patients transported to a university hospital emergency department via ambulance and also reported in a crash investigation record (CIR) during the period January 1993 to December 1995 comprised the study population. The crash characteristics analyzed were occupant position (OP), restraint use (RU), air bag deployment (AD), type of impact (TI), ejection (EJ), and external cause-of-injury code (EC). The accuracies of the police report (PR), the emergency department record (EDR), and the ambulance report (AR) for each patient were compared with the CIR by computing percent agreement, with 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CIs) for each variable and for each data source.RESULTS: Overall average agreement was 92.9{\%} for PR, 89.7{\%} for EDR, and 80.7{\%} for AR. The overall average agreement for each variable was 98.9{\%} for EJ, 92.1{\%} for AD, 91.5{\%} for OP, 90.5{\%} for EC, 77.2{\%} for RU, and 76.2{\%} for TI. For all but one variable (RU), 95{\%} CIs overlapped between data sources.CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of data sources used to determine crash characteristics varies. Using a CIR as the standard, the PR was the most accurate. Inaccuracies occurred most frequently for RU and TI. Researchers and clinicians need to be aware of these inaccuracies.}

The goal of this study was to explore the effect of NE on cancer cell EMT and to investigate the potential mechanism.METHODS: HT-29 and A549 cells were treated with NE, beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonist (propranolol) or inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor type I kinase (Ly2157299). Morphology of cells was observed with optical and electron microscope and immunofluorescence staining. Cellular migration and invasion were tested with transwell migration assay and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. TGF-beta1 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were quantified. EMT markers and signaling pathway were measured by RT-PCR and western blot.RESULTS: NE stimulated TGF-beta1 secretion and intracellular cAMP synthesis, induced morphological alterations in HT-29 and A549 cells, and enhanced their ability of migration and invasion. EMT markers induction was observed in NE-treated cancer cells. The effect of NE could be inhibited by propranolol or Ly2157299. beta-AR/TGF-beta1 signaling/p-Smad3/Snail and beta-AR/TGF-beta1 signaling/HIF-1alpha/Snail were two signaling pathways.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that TGF-beta1 signaling pathway was a significant factor of NE-induced cancer cells EMT. The data also suggested that psychological stress might be a risk factor which enhances the ability of migration or invasion of cancer cells.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Aging populations have led to increasing numbers of seniors presenting for emergency surgery. Older patients are at a higher risk of postoperative complications, prolonged hospitalization, and increased institutionalization. We hypothesized that increased frailty would be a risk factor for increased health care costs in elderly surgical patients who have undergone emergency abdominal surgery.METHODS: A prospective cost analysis of emergency general surgery patients 65 years of age and older was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Preadmission Clinical Frailty Scale score and Clavien-Dindo postoperative complications were collected. Patients were followed for 6 months after discharge. Hospitalization costs were calculated using the Alberta Health Services (AHS) microcosting database; other costs were obtained from Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health databases. The primary outcome was total insured cost (2016 Can{\$}). Multivariate generalized linear regression of log-transformed costs was conducted.RESULTS: Overall, 321 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 76.1 years (standard deviation 7.8), median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3, mean length of stay was 15.9 days (standard deviation 23.4), and 48{\%} suffered a complication. Median total insured cost was Can{\$}18,021 and median total cost was Can{\$}26,739. Multivariate analysis found American Society of Anesthesiologists score (adjusted ratio [AR]= 1.24, P= .001), CFS (AR= 1.27, P < .001), major complications (AR= 2.11, P < .001), and minor complications (AR= 1.48, P < .001) lead to increased total insured costs.CONCLUSION: Costs increased-after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and preadmission function as frailty-and American Society of Anesthesiologists score increased if minor or major complications occurred. The detection of frailty represents an opportunity to target risk-reduction strategies and interventions to improve outcomes and decrease cost.}

 abstract     = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plays a key role in the salvage treatment of prostate cancer recurrent after prostatectomy. However, not all patients benefit from salvage therapy, and there is an unmet need for biomarkers to distinguish responders from non-responders. Prostate cancer depends on androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and expression of AR splice variants (ARVs) that enable androgen-independent AR signaling is associated with resistance to ADT in the metastatic setting. Recent in vitro data suggest that ARVs also mediate DNA repair after irradiation, suggesting that ARV expression may also be a biomarker of resistance to RT. However, the landscape of ARV expression in primary prostate cancer and its effect on treatment outcomes remain unexplored. Here, we hypothesized that ARVs may be detectable in primary prostate cancer and furthermore may modulate response to salvage RT+ADT.MATERIALS/METHODS: We retrospectively identified 46 prostate cancer patients treated with prostatectomy followed by salvage RT+ ADT at a single institution from 1995 to 2012. Median age at salvage was 64.5 years. The indication for salvage therapy was biochemical failure after an undetectable post-operative PSA in 72{\%}, gross local recurrence in 17{\%}, and persistently elevated PSA after surgery in 11{\%}. Median RT dose was 64.8 Gy, and all patients received concurrent ADT. We comprehensively interrogated the landscape of ARVs by performing ultra-deep targeted RNA-seq of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy samples. Using a custom library of > 3000 primers spanning all AR exons and introns, we evaluated 21 native splice junction sites and 20 splice variants with a mean depth of coverage of > 5000x. We tested for association between splice variant expression and clinical outcomes using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: In total, 76{\%} of patients had one or more detectable AR splice variants. The most commonly detected variants were AR-45 (exon 1b-2) in 41{\%}, AR-V9 (exon 3-cryptic exon (CE) 5) in 20{\%}, and AR-V7 (exon 3-CE3) in 13{\%}. At a median follow-up of 33.8 months, biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) at 3 years was 60{\%}, distant metastasis-free survival was 90{\%}, and overall survival was 100{\%}. Among detected splice variants, only AR-V7 was associated with differential clinical outcomes, with a median BPFS of 10.9 months in AR-V7 positive vs 73.4 months in AR-V7 negative patients (P = 0.0020, HR 5.23, 95{\%} CI 1.62-16.87).CONCLUSION: Using a custom ultra-deep targeted RNA-Seq approach, we provide among the first comprehensive descriptions of the AR splice variant landscape in primary prostate cancer. Moreover, we show that detectable AR-V7 expression in prostatectomy specimens was associated with inferior outcomes following subsequent salvage RT+ADT, suggesting for the first time that AR-V7 may modulate outcomes for localized as well as metastatic disease.}

In our study, we investigated whether functional genetic polymorphisms in the dopamine active transporter 1 (DAT1) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) may play a role in antidepressant treatment response in GAD.METHODS: We examined 156 patients diagnosed with GAD who received venlafaxine Extended-Release (XR) treatment as part of an 18-month relapse-prevention study to determine whether variation in these genes had an effect on treatment response after 6months of open-label treatment. Genotypes were obtained for rs1076560 (DRD2), rs1800497 (DRD2), rs2550948 (DAT1), and a variable number tandem repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the DAT1 gene using standard methods.RESULTS: Results show that none of the tested variants were associated with treatment response to venlafaxine XR in GAD. Genotype and allele frequencies did not differ statistically significantly between responders and non-responders using either the Hamilton Anxiety or Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement Scale at 6months.CONCLUSIONS: Although we detected no association in our sample, future studies using larger samples and more comprehensive gene coverage are needed to evaluate potential effects of dopaminergic variants on antidepressant treatment response in anxiety disorders.}

Trait hostility was measured using the interpersonal hostility assessment technique to derive a hostile behavior index (HBI). Heart rate, blood pressure and hemodynamic measures were taken while participants performed three tasks: mental arithmetic, number reading and anger recall (AR).RESULTS: AR elicited the greatest blood pressure, vascular and cardiac output reactivity. HBI scores were positively related to systolic blood pressure reactivity during AR for Malays whereas this was not true for Indians and Chinese. Across tasks Indians with high HBI scores appeared to be cardiac reactors whereas the reactivity patterns for Malays and Chinese were undifferentiated. Self-report of negative mood was not related to CVR.CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with the higher rates of coronary heart disease deaths among Indians as well as the higher rates for hypertension among Malays in Singapore.}

 abstract     = {Abnormal expression of insulin gene enhancer-binding protein 1 (ISL1) has been demonstrated to be closely associated with cancer development and progression in several cancers. However, little is known about ISL1 expression in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). ISL1 has also been recognized as a positive modulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we focused on ISL1 which showed maximum upregulation at the mRNA level in the enzalutamide-resistant cell line. Accordingly, we found that ISL1 was overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B cells and its expression was significantly related to EMT. Our findings reveal the important role of ISL1 in androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cell growth; ISL1 knockdown reduced the AR activity and cell growth. ISL1 knockdown using small-interfering RNA inhibited AR, PSA, and EMT-related protein expression in C4-2B ENZR cells. In addition, knock-down ISL1 reduced the levels of AKT and p65 phosphorylation in C4-2B ENZR cells and these suggest that knock-down ISL1 suppresses EMT in part by targeting the AKT/NF-kappaB pathway. Further, ISL1 downregulation could effectively inhibit tumor growth in a human CRPC xenograft model. Together, the present study shows that downregulation of ISL1 expression is necessary for overcoming enzalutamide resistance and improving the survival of CRPC patients.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare life-threatening anesthetic emergency. With respect to the high fatality rate, difficulty in early recognition, and the lack of disease-specific drug (ie, dantrolene) in China, more effort is needed to strengthen early diagnosis and effective treatment of MH emergencies. Nowadays, mobile health (mHealth) apps are changing the way of medical practice; they can serve as an accessible tool to help anesthesiologists deal with MH crises. However, no related mHealth-based emergency system is available currently.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to outline the protocol for the development of a WeChat applet used to design a National Remote Emergency System for Malignant Hyperthermia (MH-NRES) in China, as well as the protocol for the evaluation of the user experience and perception of the system.METHODS: The system adopts the client-server architecture, with a custom user interface operating as clients and the back-end system operating as the server. The client-side software was developed using uni-app technology with Vue.js-based framework, which consists of 6 modules: Quick Diagnosis, Dantrolene Mobilization, Instruction on Dantrolene Use, MH Treatment, Recovery Period Treatment, and DNA Test and Biopsy. The back-end system was developed based on the Spring framework. The system will be evaluated by administrating a modified user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale. Pilot testing will be conducted in Sichuan Province, China, and a subsequent evaluation on a national scale is planned.RESULTS: The theoretical framework design of this system was completed in August 2021. The development of the system was completed in February 2022, and the refinement is currently ongoing. Pilot testing after the implementation of the system in Sichuan Province is planned to take 2 months, and the subsequent evaluation on a national scale is planned to take 2 months.CONCLUSIONS: We have described a novel approach using the WeChat applet to develop the MH-NRES. Findings from the usability testing process in the current study may lead to refinements and is expected to suggest that this system is both feasible and welcomed by anesthesiologists. Depending on the availability of research funding, this system will be extended nationally across China.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/37084.}

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process where epithelial cells take on a migratory mesenchymal phenotype and is essential for normal tissue repair and signal through multiple inflammatory pathways. However, while links between EMT and both asthma and AR have been demonstrated, as we outline in this mini-review, the literature investigating AD and EMT is far less well-elucidated. Furthermore, current studies on EMT and atopy are mostly animal models or ex vivo studies on cell cultures or tissue biopsies. The literature covered in this mini-review on EMT-related barrier dysfunction as a contributor to AD as well as the related (perhaps resultant) atopic diseases indicates a potential for therapeutic targeting and carry treatment implications for topical steroid use and environmental exposure assessments.

Exploiting our consolidated 'ex-vivo' system, we show that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) released factors have pivotal roles in inducing genome methylation changes required for EMT and stemness in EMT-prone PCa cells. By global DNA methylation analysis and RNA-Seq, we provide compelling evidence that conditioned media from CAFs explanted from two unrelated patients with advanced PCa, stimulates concurrent DNA hypo- and hyper-methylation required for EMT and stemness in PC3 and DU145, but not in LN-CaP and its derivative C4-2B, PCa cells. CpG island (CGI) hyper-methylation associates with repression of genes required for epithelial maintenance and invasion antagonism, whereas activation of EMT markers and stemness genes correlate with CGI hypo-methylation. Remarkably, methylation variations and EMT-regulated transcripts almost completely reverse qualitatively and quantitatively during MET. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the PRAD TCGA data set with the differentially expressed (DE) and methylated EMT signature, identified a gene cluster of DE genes defined by a CAF+ and AR- phenotype and worst diagnosis. This gene cluster includes the relevant factors for EMT and stemness, which display DNA methylation variations in regulatory regions inversely correlated to their expression changes, thus strongly sustaining the ex-vivo data. DNMT3A-dependent methylation is essential for silencing epithelial maintenance and EMT counteracting genes, such as CDH1 and GRHL2, that is, the direct repressor of ZEB1, the key transcriptional factor for EMT and stemness. Accordingly, DNMT3A knock-down prevents EMT entry. These results shed light on the mechanisms of establishment and maintenance of coexisting DNA hypo- and hyper-methylation patterns during cancer progression, the generation of EMT and cell stemness in advanced PCa, and may pave the way to new therapeutic implications.}

Cell migration was measured using both transwell and scratch assays. Proteins in the SMAD signaling pathway were measured by Western blotting. The interactions of AR and SMADs were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and proximity ligation assay (PLA). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) expression was measured by Western blot and quantitative PCR (q-PCR). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities were measured in conditioned medium by zymography.RESULTS: We observed that either Sorbinil-mediated AR inhibition or siRNA-mediated AR gene knockdown prevented migration of lens epithelial cells following exposure to TGF-beta2. AR inhibition or AR knockdown reduced SMAD and MMP activation triggered by TGF-beta2. In addition, we demonstrated AR inhibition or AR knockdown decreased TGF-beta2-induced expression of EMT markers. Co-IP studies and PLA were used to demonstrate that AR and SMAD2 interact either directly or in close concert with additional factor(s) in a nonenzymatic manner.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that AR participates in the response of lens epithelial cells to TGF-beta2. Our studies raise the possibility that AR inhibition may be effective in preventing development of PCO by disrupting the TGF-beta2/SMAD pathway.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: As health care complexity increases, skilled care coordination is becoming increasingly necessary. This is especially true in homecare settings, where services tend to be highly interprofessional. Poor coordination can result in services being provided twice, at the wrong time, unnecessarily or not at all. In addition to risking harm to the client, such confusion leads to unnecessary costs. From the patient's perspective, then, professional coordination should help both to remove barriers limiting quality of care and to minimize costs. To date, though, studies examining the relationship between care coordination and care quality have faced multiple challenges, leading to mixed results. And in homecare contexts, where the clients are highly vulnerable and diverse care interfaces make coordination especially challenging, such studies are rare.OBJECTIVES: Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship, from the perspectives of clients and of homecare professionals, between coordination and quality of care. For both groups, we hypothesized that better coordination would correlate with higher ratings of quality of care. For the clients, we predicted that higher coordination ratings would lead to lower incidence of unplanned health care use, i.e., emergency department (ED) visits, unscheduled urgent medical visits and hospitalizations.DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is part of a national multi-center cross-sectional study in the Swiss homecare setting. We recruited 88 homecare agencies and collected data between January and September 2021 through written questionnaires for agencies' managers, employees (n = 3223) and clients (n = 1509). To test our hypotheses, we conducted multilevel analyses.RESULTS: Employee-perceived care coordination ratings correlated positively with employee-rated quality of care (OR = 2.78, p < .001); client-perceived care coordination problems correlated inversely with client-reported quality of care (beta = -0.55, p < .001). Client-perceived coordination problems also correlated positively with hospitalizations (IRR = 1.20, p < .05) and unscheduled urgent medical visits (IRR = 1.18, p < .05), but not significantly with ED visits. No associations were discernible between employee-perceived coordination quality and either health care service use or client quality-of-care ratings.DISCUSSION: While results indicate relationships between coordination and diverse aspects of care quality, various coordination gaps (e.g., poor information flow) also became apparent. The measurement of both care coordination and quality of care remains a challenge. Further research should focus on developing and validating a coordination questionnaire that measures care coordination.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Public health emergencies resulting from major man-made crises and large-scale natural disasters severely impact developing countries, causing unprecedented rates of indirect mortality and morbidity, especially in children and women. Concomitantly, the state of children's health in the least-developed countries is the worst since the 1950s before the Declaration of Alma Ata. Worldwide decline in public health protections, infrastructures, and systems, and a health worker crisis primarily in Africa and Asia, limit the delivery of intensive and critical care services.METHODS: In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subgroups by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature.TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS: Using pandemics as a model of public health emergencies, steps to improve care to the most vulnerable of populations are outlined, including mandates under the International Health Regulations Treaty of 2007 and World Health Organization guidelines. Recommendations include an emphasis on first improving primary care, prevention, and basic emergency care, where possible. Advances in care should move incrementally without compromising primary care resources. A first step in preparing for a pandemic in developing countries involves building capacity in public health surveillance and proven community containment and mitigation strategies. Given the severe lack of healthcare workers in at least 57 countries, the Task Force also supports World Health Organization's recommendations that planning for a public health emergency include means for health workers to collaborate with staff in the military, transport, and education sectors as well as international healthcare workers to maximize the efficiency of scarce human resources. Rapid response teams can be augmented by international subject matter experts if these do not exist at the country level.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Prostate carcinoma (PRAD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies amongst men worldwide. It is well-known that androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in a vast majority of prostate tumors. However, recent evidence emerged stating that estrogen receptors (ERs) may also contribute to prostate tumor development. Moreover, progression and aggressiveness of prostate cancer may be associated with differential expression genes of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore we aimed to assess the significance of receptors status as well as EMT marker genes expression among PRAD patients in accordance to their age and Gleason score.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed TCGA gene expression profiles of 497 prostate tumor samples according to 43 genes involved in EMT and 3 hormone receptor genes (AR, ESR1, ESR2) as well as clinical characteristic of cancer patients. Then patients were divided into four groups according to their age and 5 groups according to Gleason score. Next, we evaluated PRAD samples according to relationship between the set of variables in different combinations and compared differential expression in subsequent groups of patients. The analysis was applied using R packages: FactoMineR, gplots, RColorBrewer and NMF.RESULTS: MFA analysis resulted in distinct grouping of PRAD patients into four age categories according to expression level of AR, ESR1 and ESR2 with the most distinct group of age less than 50 years old. Further investigations indicated opposite expression profiles of EMT markers between different age groups as well as strong association of EMT gene expression with Gleason score. We found that depending on age of prostate cancer patients and Gleason score EMT genes with distinctly altered expression are: KRT18, KRT19, MUC1 and COL4A1, CTNNB1, SNAI2, ZEB1 and MMP3.CONCLUSIONS: Our major observation is that prostate cancer from patients under 50 years old compared to older ones has entirely different EMT gene expression profiles showing potentially more aggressive invasive phenotype, despite Gleason score classification.}

Suicidal behavior, the most tragic consequence of untreated or unsuccessfully treated depression, commonly observed in the first few weeks of antidepressive treatment before the onset of therapeutic action, is strongly related to certain symptoms of depression like insomnia. The present paper reviews the newly discovered and well-documented antidepressive effect of quetiapine in bipolar and unipolar depression with special focus on its early onset of action and its sleep-improving effects. Both beneficial effects play an important role in the reduction of suicidal risk frequently observed in depressed patients.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs can substantially enhance the sub-optimal coverage achieved under existing delivery strategies. Randomized SLIV trials have shown these programs reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza among both vaccinated and unvaccinated children. This work explores the effectiveness of a SLIV program in reducing the community risk of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) associated emergency care visits.METHODS: For the 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons, we estimated age-group specific attack rates (AR) for ILI from routine surveillance and census data. Age-group specific SLIV program effectiveness was estimated as one minus the AR ratio for Alachua County versus two comparison regions: the 12 county region surrounding Alachua County, and all non-Alachua counties in Florida.RESULTS: Vaccination of 50{\%} of 5-17 year-olds in Alachua reduced their risk of ILI-associated visits, compared to the rest of Florida, by 79{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 70, 85) in 2011/12 and 71{\%} (63, 77) in 2012/13. The greatest indirect effectiveness was observed among 0-4 year-olds, reducing AR by 89{\%} (84, 93) in 2011/12 and 84{\%} (79, 88) in 2012/13. Among all non-school age residents, the estimated indirect effectiveness was 60{\%} (54, 65) and 36{\%} (31, 41) for 2011/12 and 2012/13. The overall effectiveness among all age-groups was 65{\%} (61, 70) and 46{\%} (42, 50) for 2011/12 and 2012/13.CONCLUSION: Wider implementation of SLIV programs can significantly reduce the influenza-associated public health burden in communities.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-based treatment for co-occurring disorders is needed within programs that serve homeless Veterans to assist with increasing engagement in care and to prevent future housing loss. A specialized co-occurring disorders treatment engagement intervention called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking - Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet) was implemented within the Housing and Urban Development - Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Programs with and without an implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes (GTO). While implementation was modest for the GTO group, no one adopted MISSION in the non-GTO group. This paper reports Veteran level outcome data on treatment engagement and select behavioral health outcomes for Veterans exposed to the MISSION-Vet model compared to Veterans without access to MISSION-Vet.METHODS: This hybrid Type III trial compared 81 Veterans in the GTO group to a similar group of 87 Veterans with mental health and substance use disorders from the caseload of staff in the non-GTO group. Comparisons were made on treatment engagement, negative housing exits, drug and alcohol abuse, inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits and income level over time, using mixed-effect or Cox regression models.RESULTS: Treatment engagement, as measured by the overall number of case manager contacts with Veterans and others (e.g. family members, health providers), was significantly higher among Veterans in the GTO group (B=2.30, p=.04). Supplemental exploratory analyses between Veterans who received "higher" and "lower" intensity MISSION-Vet services in the GTO group failed to show differences in alcohol and drug use, inpatient hospitalization and emergency department use.CONCLUSIONS: Despite modest MISSION-Vet fidelity among staff treating Veterans in the GTO group, differences were found in treatment engagement. However, this study failed to show differences in alcohol use, drug use, mental health hospitalizations and negative housing exits over time among those Veterans receiving higher intensity MISSION-Vet services versus low intensity services. This project suggests that MISSION-Vet could be used in HUD-VASH to increase engagement among Veterans struggling with homelessness, a group often disconnected from care.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, registration number: NCT01430741 , registered July 26, 2011.}

 abstract     = {Although the newly developed second-generation anti-androgen drug enzalutamide can repress prostate cancer progression significantly, it only extends the survival of prostate cancer patients by 4-6 months mainly due to the occurrence of enzalutamide resistance. Most of the previous studies on AR antagonist resistance have been focused on AR signaling. Therefore, the non-AR pathways on enzalutamide resistance remain largely unknown. By using C4-2, CWR22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines, as well as mice bearing CWR22Rv1 xenografts treated with either enzalutamide or metformin alone or in combination, we demonstrated that metformin is capable of reversing enzalutamide resistance and restores sensitivity of CWR22Rv1 xenografts to enzalutamide. We showed that metformin alleviated resistance to enzalutamide by inhibiting EMT. Furthermore, based on the effect of metformin on the activation of STAT3 and expression of TGF-beta1, we propose that metformin exerts its effects by targeting the TGF-beta1/STAT3 axis. These findings suggest that combination of metformin with enzalutamide could be a more efficacious therapeutic strategy for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.}

The dependent variable was the emergency AD hospital admissions occurred in Madrid during the period 2001-2009. Independent variables were: Daily mean concentrations (mug/m3) of air pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10; O3 and NO2); maximum daily temperature ({\textdegree}C) and daily and night noise levels (dB(A)). Relative Risk (RR) for an increment in interquartile range, and Attributable Risk (AR) values were calculated through GLM with Poisson link.RESULTS: Our findings indicated that only PM2.5 concentrations at lag 2 with a RR: 1.38 (95{\%} CI: 1.15-1.65); AR 27.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 13.0-39.4); and heat wave days at lag 3 with a RR: 1.30 (95{\%} CI: 1.12-1.52); AR 23.1{\%} (95{\%} CI: 10.7-34.2) were associated with AD hospital admissions.CONCLUSION: A reduction in AD patients' exposure levels to PM2.5 and special care of such patients during heat wave periods could result in a decrease in both emergency AD admissions and the related health care costs.}

The main cause of accidents is absence of a safety belt and safety belt ring. To solve these problems, we create ETA based scenarios to derive results based on safety considerations. Based on these results, we propose a solution by applying ICT technology for accident prevention. Deriving ETA based scenarios and ICT technology, the proposed solutions include a system for detecting the wearing of safety belts and safety helmets, a system for detecting whether or not the safety belts are connected, and a hook system for measuring safety distances. These safety related systems can reduce the probability of death of workers.

This analysis examines long-term changes in HRQoL among patients with schizophrenia switched to lurasidone from other antipsychotics.METHODS: Patients who completed an open-label 6-week switch study continued on lurasidone for an additional 24-weeks. HRQoL was measured using the self-reported Personal Evaluation of Transitions in Treatment (PETiT) scale and Short-Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire. The PETiT assessed HRQoL via total and domain scores (adherence-related attitude and psychosocial functioning). The SF-12 assessed patients' mental and physical component summary scores (MCS and PCS). Mean changes from the initial baseline were calculated at extension baseline and extension endpoint using analysis of covariance models. Analyses were further stratified by prior antipsychotic medication and responder status; responders were defined as having a ≥20{\%} improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale during the first 6-weeks of treatment.RESULTS: The analysis included 144 patients with PETIT or SF-12 data who received ≥1 dose of lurasidone. Mean (standard deviation) PETiT total score improved significantly from 34.9 (9.3) at baseline to 39.5 (8.9) at extension baseline and 39.1 (9.0) at extension endpoint, representing improvements of 4.5 (7.9) and 5.1 (7.2) points, respectively (both p<0.001). Significant improvements in adherence-related attitude and psychosocial functioning were observed at extension baseline and extension endpoint (all p<0.001). Improvement in SF-12 MCS score was observed at extension baseline and endpoint, and PCS score at extension endpoint (all p<0.01). Patients who switched from quetiapine and aripiprazole showed significant improvement of PETiT total score and adherence-related attitude at extension baseline and extension endpoint. In addition, patients who switched from quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, or ziprasidone showed significant improvement in MCS scores from baseline to extension endpoint. Responders to lurasidone demonstrated greater improvement in PETiT total, psychosocial functioning, and MCS scores at extension baseline than nonresponders.CONCLUSIONS: After switching to lurasidone, patients with schizophrenia experienced HRQoL improvements that were sustained for an additional 24weeks of treatment. Further study is warranted to understand the implications of these improvements in terms of employment, adherence, relapse, and rehospitalization.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials.gov identifier NCT01143090 (June 10th, 2010).}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluating convenient, wearable multi-frequency impedance pneumography (IP)-based respiratory monitoring in ambulatory persons with novel electrode positioning.METHODS: A wearable multi-frequency IP system was utilized to estimate tidal volume (TV) and respiratory timings in 14 healthy subjects. A 5.1 cm * 5.1 cm tetrapolar electrode array, affixed to the sternum, and a conventional thoracic electrode configuration were employed to measure the respective IP signals, patch and thoracic IP. Data collected during static postures-sitting and supine-and activities-walking and stair-stepping-were evaluated against a simultaneously-obtained spirometer (SP) volume signal.RESULTS: Across all measurements, estimated TV obtained from the patch and thoracic IP maintained a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.93 {\textpm} 0.05 and 0.95 {\textpm} 0.05 to the ground truth TV, respectively, with an associated root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.177 L and 0.129 L, respectively. Average respiration rates (RRs) were extracted from 30-second segments with mean-absolute-percentage errors (MAPEs) of 0.93{\%} and 0.74{\%} for patch and thoracic IP, respectively. Likewise, average inspiratory and expiratory timings were identified with MAPEs less than 6{\%} and 4.5{\%} for patch and thoracic IP, respectively.CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that patch IP performs comparably to traditional, cumbersome IP configurations. We also present for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that IP can robustly estimate breath-by-breath TV and respiratory timings during ambulation.SIGNIFICANCE: This work represents a notable step towards pervasive wearable ambulatory respiratory monitoring via the fusion of a compact chest-worn form factor and multi-frequency IP that can be readily adapted for holistic cardiopulmonary monitoring.}

 abstract     = {The development of allergic sensitization and inflammation is dependent on activation and stimulation of T cells that exhibit pro-allergic functions. A mouse model system was developed to study the role of T cells in allergic sensitization in more detail. Local sensitization of mice stimulates an allergen specific IgE/IgG1 response that is associated with the development of immediate type skin test responses and increased airway responsiveness (AR). Strains of mice are identified that are high or low responder animals for allergens including ovalbumin and house dust mite. Each allergen stimulates a different pattern of T-cell receptor V beta expressing T cells in local draining lymph nodes. To induce a state of increased AR, at least two separate events are required. The first event is the presence of allergen specific IgE/IgG1. The second event is characterized as a local allergen challenge at the site of the response. These T cells play a critical role in the regulation of the allergic immune response including IgE production and increased AR. Based on these results intervention strategies can be developed which specifically target the development and function of these allergen specific T-cell populations and modify their pro-allergic activities.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Telepsychiatry is the use of virtual communication, such as a video link, to deliver mental health assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Previous studies have shown telepsychiatry to be feasible, accurate compared with in-person practice, and satisfying for psychiatrists and patients. Telepsychiatry has also been associated with reduced waiting times for evaluation and, in some studies, lower admission rates. However, most previous studies focused on using telepsychiatry in community settings and not on involuntary admission.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness and implementation process of patient assessment for involuntary admissions in the psychiatric emergency department (ED) using a video link.METHODS: This type 1 hybrid implementation study will examine telepsychiatry effectiveness and the implementation process, by comparing telepsychiatry (n=240) with historical controls who had a face-to-face evaluation (n=240) during the previous, usual care period in 5 psychiatric EDs in Israel. A temporary waiver of the standing policy requiring in-person evaluations only, for the purpose of research, was obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health. During the telepsychiatry phase, clinical staff and patients will join a video call from the ED, while the attending physician will log in elsewhere. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework will guide the evaluation of the telepsychiatry implementation process in the ED. PARIHS has the following 3 constructs: (1) evidence: staff's opinions regarding the innovation's viability and practicality, their satisfaction levels with its use, and patients' perceptions of the change; (2) context: level of approval of new strategies in the ED, decision-making processes, and the manner in which clinical teams converse and work together; (3) facilitation: adequacy of the facilitation efforts using champions reports. Primary clinical outcomes include ED length of stay and violent incidents obtained from medical records.RESULTS: This study received Helsinki approval from the Ethics Committee of Abarbanel Mental Health Center (174; March 13, 2023), Jerusalem Mental Health Center (22-21; November 6, 2022), Lev-Hasharon Mental Health Medical Center (LH12023; February 12, 2023), Tel-Aviv Medical Center (TLV-22-0656; January 3, 2023), and Sha'ar Menashe (1-4-23; April 18, 2023). Data collection began in July 2023 in 2 study sites and will begin soon at the others.CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry could have significant benefits for patients in the psychiatric ED. Examining telepsychiatry effectiveness in the ED, in addition to identifying the facilitators and barriers of implementing it in different emergency settings, will facilitate better policy decisions regarding its implementation.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05771545; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05771545.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/49405.}

 abstract     = {Fire disaster is one of the most common hazards that threaten public safety and social development: how to improve the fire escape and rescue capacity remains a huge challenge. Here, a 3D honeycomb-structured woven fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (F-TENG) based on a flame-retardant wrapping yarn is developed. The wrapping yarn is fabricated through a continuous hollow spindle fancy twister technology, which is compatible with traditional textile production processes. The resulting 3D F-TENG can be used in smart carpets as a self-powered escape and rescue system that can precisely locate the survivor position and point out the escape route to timely assist victim search and rescuing. As interior decoration, the unique design of the honeycomb weaving structure endows the F-TENG fabric with an excellent noise-reduction ability. In addition, combining with its good machine washability, air permeability, flame-retardency, durability, and repeatability features, the 3D F-TENG may have great potential applications in fire rescue and wearable sensors as well as smart home decoration.}

Using a mixed-methods design, we assessed participants' knowledge and confidence to fulfill targeted federal preparedness capabilities immediately before and after the exercise. We also evaluated the degree to which participants made progress on actions through surveys 1month (n = 14) and 6 months (n = 14) after the exercise.RESULTS: Participants reported a greater ability to identify their state's pediatric emergency preparedness strengths and weaknesses after the exercise (16 of 18) compared with before the exercise (10 of 18). We also observed increases in (1) knowledge of and confidence in performing most pediatric emergency preparedness capabilities and (2) most dimensions of interprofessional collaboration. From 1month to 6 months after the exercise, participants (n = 14) self-reported making progress in increasing awareness for potential preparedness partners and in conducting similar pediatric exercises (from 4-7 for both).CONCLUSIONS: Participants viewed the VTTX positively and indicated increased pediatric emergency preparedness knowledge and confidence. Addressing barriers to improving local pediatric emergency preparedness-particularly long term-is an important target for future tabletop exercises.}

 abstract     = {Entry motion sickness (EMS) affects crewmembers upon return to Earth following extended adaptation to microgravity. Anticholinergic pharmaceuticals (e.g., Meclizine) are often taken prior to landing; however, they have operationally adverse side effects (e.g., drowsiness). There is a need to develop non-pharmaceutical countermeasures to EMS. We assessed the efficacy of a technological countermeasure providing external visual cues following splashdown, where otherwise only nauseogenic internal cabin visual references are available. Our countermeasure provided motion-congruent visual cues of an Earth-fixed scene in virtual reality, which was compared to a control condition with a head-fixed fixation point in virtual reality in a between-subject design with 15 subjects in each group. We tested the countermeasure's effectiveness at mitigating motion sickness symptoms at the end of a ground-based reentry analog: approximately 1h of 2Gx centrifugation followed by up to 1h of wave-like motion. Secondarily, we explored differences in vestibular-mediated balance performance between the two conditions. While Motion Sickness Questionnaire outcomes did not differ detectably between groups, we found significantly better survival rates (with dropout dictated by reporting moderate nausea consecutively over 2min) in the visual countermeasure group than the control group (79{\%} survival vs. 33{\%}, t(14)=2.50, p=0.027). Following the reentry analogs, subjects demonstrated significantly higher sway prior to recovery (p=0.0004), which did not differ between control and countermeasure groups. These results imply that providing motion-congruent visual cues may be an effective mean for curbing the development of moderate nausea and increasing comfort following future space missions.}

On the other hand, fetal liver cells from the corn oil (vehicle for the carcinogen)-exposed progeny (control) appeared to enhance proliferation. Suppression or enhancement appeared to be mediated by fetal liver bearing CD8+ and Lyt 1+ (CD5+) cells. Despite these manifestations, the role of third-party cells needs to be considered. As a first premise, adherent cells were targeted as possible third-party cells. To test the role of the adherent cells, liver cells from benzo(alpha)pyrene-exposed fetuses were treated with ficoll-hypaque, and the interface cells were fractionated through glass wool or nylon wool. It is known that adhering cells, macrophages and B cells, readily attach to glass or nylon wool. The effluent cells and the adherent cells were cultured with syngeneic responder cells and allogeneic stimulator cells in a mixed lymphocyte response. The results showed that benzo(alpha)pyrene-effluent cells led to the enhancement of proliferation in the mixed lymphocyte response, while benzo(alpha)pyrene-adherent cells led to suppression. The effluent and adherent cells of corn oil controls did not modify cell proliferation in the mixed lymphocyte response. These data suggest that a third-party cell, reasonably the macrophage or possibly B cells or both, since these are adherent cells, play a decided role in mediating suppression in the benzo(alpha)pyrene-exposed progeny.}

 abstract     = {Given the limitations of self-reports on drug use, testing for drugs of abuse is important for most clinical and forensic toxicological situations, both for assessing the reality of the intoxication and for evaluation of the level of drug impairment. It is generally accepted that chemical testing of biological fluids is the most objective means of diagnosis of drug use. The presence of a drug analyte in a biological specimen can be used to document exposure. The standard in drug testing is the immunoassay screen, followed by the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric confirmation conducted on a urine sample. In recent years, remarkable advances in sensitive analytical techniques have enabled the analysis of drugs in unconventional biological specimens such as hair. The advantages of this sample over traditional media, like urine and blood, are obvious: collection is noninvasive, relatively easy to perform, and in forensic situations it may be achieved under close supervision of law enforcement officers to prevent adulteration or substitution. The window of drug detection is dramatically extended to weeks, months or even years when testing hair. It seems that the value of alternative specimen analysis for the identification of drug users is steadily gaining recognition. This can be seen from its growing use in preemployment screening, in forensic sciences, in clinical applications and for doping control. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in urine. Methods for evading urinalysis do not affect hair analysis. The aim of this review is to document toxicological applications of hair analysis in drug detection.}

All ED patients 18 years or older were eligible. Exclusion criteria included pregnant women, prisoners, altered mental status, non-English speakers, traumas, and patients unable to provide consent. Data were obtained by ED patient interview and review of the preceding 3 months of the medical record. We report the difference between patient self-report and chart review of identifying 1 or more AR risk factors using McNemar's chi(2). The test statistic was also calculated for individual risk factors and significance adjusted for multiple comparisons (P < .003). Agreement was calculated using kappa with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). Risk factor domains assessed included nursing home residence, recent health care utilization, current indwelling devices, and medical history.RESULTS: Among 289 patients, 1 or more risk factors were reported by 68{\%} (95{\%} CI, 63{\%}-74{\%}) of patients and found in 59{\%} (95{\%} CI, 53{\%}-65{\%}) of charts, a difference of 9.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 5.3{\%}-14{\%}) (P < .001; kappa = 0.72).

 abstract     = {Wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for measuring brain function, in terms of hemodynamic responses, is pervading our everyday life and holds the potential to reliably classify cognitive load in a naturalistic environment. However, human's brain hemodynamic response, behavior, and cognitive and task performance vary, even within and across homogeneous individuals (with same training and skill sets), which limits the reliability of any predictive model for human. In the context of high-stakes tasks, such as in military and first-responder operations, the real-time monitoring of cognitive functions and relating it to the ongoing task, performance outcomes, and behavioral dynamics of the personnel and teams is invaluable. In this work, a portable wearable fNIRS system (WearLight) developed by the author was upgraded, and an experimental protocol was designed to image the prefrontal cortex (PFC) area of the brain of 25 healthy homogeneous participants in a naturalistic environment while participants performed n-back working memory (WM) tasks with four difficulty levels. The raw fNIRS signals were processed using a signal processing pipeline to derive the brain's hemodynamic responses. An unsupervised k-means machine learning (ML) clustering approach, utilizing the task-induced hemodynamic responses as input variables, suggested three unique participant groups. Task performance in terms of {\%} correct, {\%} missing, reaction time, inverse efficiency score (IES), and a proposed IES was extensively evaluated for each participant and the three groups. Results showed that, on average, brain hemodynamic response increased, whereas task performance degraded, with increasing WM load. However, the regression and correlation analysis of WM task, performance, and the brain's hemodynamic responses (TPH) revealed interesting hidden characteristics and the variation in the TPH relationship between groups. The proposed IES also served as a better scoring method that had distinct score ranges for different load levels as opposed to the overlapping scores of the traditional IES method. Results showed that the k-means clustering has the potential to find groups of individuals in an unsupervised manner using the brain's hemodynamic responses and to study the underlying relationship between the TPH in groups. Using the method presented in this paper, real-time monitoring of cognitive and task performance of soldiers, and preferentially forming small units to accomplish tasks based on the insights and goals may be helpful. The results showed that WearLight can image PFC, and this study also suggests future directions for the multi-modal body sensor network (BSN) combining advanced ML algorithms for real-time state classification, cognitive and physical performance prediction, and the mitigation of performance degradation in the high-stakes environment.}

In addition, examine the variability in executing each motion to inform future self-defense strategies.METHODS: Twenty subjects (Females, n=4; Males, n=16; Height: 179.96{\textpm}8.66cm; Weight: 94.99{\textpm}22.37kg; Age: 36.95{\textpm}10.63 years) who were all active-duty law enforcement officers (LEOs) with 13.52{\textpm}11.23 years of LEO experience were recruited to participate in the study. Each subject completed two trials of the knife motions while wearing wearable motion sensors (ADPM) and recorded with a high-speed camera (GoPro) while using a training knife (Cold Steel).RESULTS: The time to complete the motions were: Thrust, 0.61{\textpm}0.15s; Overhead, 0.68{\textpm}0.14s; Figure 8, 1.07{\textpm}0.21s; and Reverse, 0.62{\textpm}0.11s. The Figure 8 motion was significantly slower than the other three motions: F (3, 57) =101.19, p<0.001, etap2=0.84. The reliability analysis reported trivial variability and a high level of agreement: Thrust, ICCalpha=0.701, SEM=0.09s, CV{\%}=15.02; Overhead, ICCalpha=0.878, SEM=0.05s, CV{\%}=6.93; Figure 8, ICCalpha=0.906, SEM=0.07s, CV{\%}=6.25, Reverse, ICCalpha=0.420, SEM=0.10s, CV{\%}=17.31.DISCUSSION: Most LEOs or civilians within striking distance of someone with a knife may not be able to avoid contact from the knife attacks based on the speed knife attacks could occur.CONCLUSION: The reference data provides pertinent information to update evidence-based training approaches to knife attack preparation and defense.}

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Surgical resident operative autonomy has decreased markedly over time, reducing resident readiness for independent practice. We sought to examine operative resident autonomy for emergency acute care surgery (ACS) compared to elective cases and associated patient outcomes at veterans affairs hospitals.METHODS: The Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for ACS cases (emergency general, vascular, and thoracic) at veterans affairs hospitals from 2004 to 2019. Cases are coded prospectively for the level of supervision: attending primary surgeon (AP); attending scrubbed with resident surgeon (AR); resident primary (RP), attending not scrubbed. Baseline demographics, operative variables, and outcomes were compared.RESULTS: A total of 61,275 ACS cases and 605,146 elective cases were performed during the study period. The ACS had a higher proportion of RP cases (7.2{\%} versus 5.7{\%}, P<0.001). The proportion of ACS RP cases decreased from 9.9{\%} to 4.1{\%} (58.6{\%}); elective RP cases decreased from 8.9{\%} to 2.9{\%} (67.4{\%}). The most common ACS RP surgeries were appendectomy, amputations, and cholecystectomy. RP cases had lower American Society of Anesthesia class and lower median work relative value units than AP and AR. There was no difference between mortality rates of RP compared to AP (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.94 [0.80-1.09] or AR 0.94 [0.81-1.08]). While there was no difference in complications between the RP and AP (OR 1.01 [0.92-1.12]), there were significantly more complications in AR compared to RP (OR 1.20 [1.10-1.31]).CONCLUSIONS: More autonomy is granted for ACS cases compared to elective cases. While both decreased over time, the decrease is less for ACS cases. Resident autonomy does not negatively impact outcomes, even in emergent cases.}

Few studies have addressed the intensity of a full day of nursing work as measured by changes in heart rate and energy expenditure.OBJECTIVE: A pilot study was conducted between August 2009 and May 2010 to examine the intensity of performing nursing assistant work in long term care settings and to assess the usefulness of heart rate monitoring as a measure of work intensity. The residents of the facilities were physically dependent adults. The settings had floor-based mechanical lifting devices available and no-lift policies that restricted workers from lifting.PARTICIPANTS: Eight women between the ages of 19 and 54 from two facilities participated in this study.METHODS: A wearable recorder allowed unobtrusive heart rate monitoring while nursing assistants worked their usual shift. Continuous heart rate monitoring for a full shift provided an estimation of energy expenditure.RESULTS: The data suggest that the nursing assistants worked at a moderate level yet were within the safe work intensity level recommended by NIOSH [32].CONCLUSIONS: The information provides preliminary baseline data for nursing assistants who work with physically dependent adults using floor-based lifts in a no-lift environment.}

Multiple TERT-locus variants at 5p15 have been discovered in association with cancer risk, yet the underlying mechanisms and clinical impacts remain unclear. Here, our association studies showed that the TERT promoter variant rs2853669 confers a risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in different ethnic groups. Further functional investigation revealed that the allele-specific binding of MYC and E2F1 at TERT promoter variant rs2853669 associates with elevated level of TERT in PCa. Mechanistically, androgen stimulations promoted the binding of MYC to allele T of rs2853669, thereby activating TERT, whereas hormone deprivations enhanced E2F1 binding at allele C of rs2853669, thus upregulating TERT expression. Notably, E2F1 could cooperate with AR signaling to regulate MYC expression. Clinical data demonstrated synergistic effects of MYC/E2F1/TERT expression or with the TT and CC genotype of rs2853669 on PCa prognosis and severity. Strikingly, single-nucleotide editing assays showed that the CC genotype of rs2853669 obviously promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the development of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), confirmed by unbiased global transcriptome profiling. Our findings thus provided compelling evidence for understanding the roles of noncoding variations coordinated with androgen signaling and oncogenic transcription factors in mis-regulating TERT expression and driving PCa.}

 abstract     = {SULT2B1b (SULT2B) is a prostate-expressed hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, which may regulate intracrine androgen homeostasis by mediating 3beta-sulfation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the precursor for 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) biosynthesis. The aldo-keto reductase (AKR)1C3 regulates androgen receptor (AR) activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by promoting tumor tissue androgen biosynthesis from adrenal DHEA and also by functioning as an AR-selective coactivator. Herein we report that SULT2B-depleted CRPC cells, arising from stable RNA interference or gene knockout (KO), are markedly upregulated for AKR1C3, activated for ERK1/2 survival signal, and induced for epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT)-like changes. EMT was evident from increased mesenchymal proteins and elevated EMT-inducing transcription factors SNAI1 and TWIST1 in immunoblot and single-cell mass cytometry analyses. SULT2B KO cells showed greater motility and invasion in vitro; growth escalation in xenograft study; and enhanced metastatic potential predicted on the basis of decreased cell stiffness and adhesion revealed from atomic force microscopy analysis. While AR and androgen levels were unchanged, AR activity was elevated, since PSA and FKBP5 mRNA induction by DHT-activated AR was several-fold higher in SULT2B-silenced cells. AKR1C3 silencing prevented ERK1/2 activation and SNAI1 induction in SULT2B-depleted cells. SULT2B was undetectable in nearly all CRPC metastases from 50 autopsy cases. Primary tumors showed variable and Gleason score (GS)-independent SULT2B levels. CRPC metastases lacking SULT2B expressed AKR1C3. Since AKR1C3 is frequently elevated in advanced prostate cancer, the inhibitory influence of SULT2B on AKR1C3 upregulation, ERK1/2 activation, EMT-like induction, and on cell motility and invasiveness may be clinically significant. Pathways regulating the inhibitory SULT2B-AKR1C3 axis may inform new avenue(s) for targeting SULT2B-deficient prostate cancer.}

 abstract     = {Zinc finger E-box-binding protein 2 (ZEB2) is known to help mediate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and thereby it facilitates cancer metastasis. This study was initiated to explore whether ZEB2 expression differs in prostate cancer (PCa, n=7) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, n=7) tissues. In PCa tissues, the levels of both immunoreactive ZEB2 and androgen receptor (AR) were found to be significantly higher (P<0.05) when compared with BPH tissues. Co-regulation of AR and ZEB2 prompted us to investigate the role of androgenic stimuli in ZEB2 expression. ZEB2 expression was found to be significantly (P<0.05) upregulated after androgen stimulation and downregulated following AR silencing in LNCaP cells, an androgen-dependent PCa cell line. This finding suggested AR as a positive regulator of ZEB2 expression in androgen-dependent cells. Paradoxically, androgen-independent (AI) cell lines PC3 and DU145, known to possess low AR levels, showed significantly (P<0.05) higher expression of ZEB2 compared with LNCaP cells. Furthermore, forced expression of AR in PC3 (PC3-AR) and DU145 (DU-AR) cells led to reductions in ZEB2 expression, invasiveness, and migration. These cells also exhibited an increase in the levels of E-cadherin (a transcriptional target of ZEB2). Co-transfection of AR and ZEB2 cDNA constructs prevented the decline in invasiveness and migration to a significant extent. Additionally, ZEB2 downregulation was associated with an increase in miR200a/miR200b levels in PC3-AR cells and with a decrease in miR200a/miR200b levels in AR-silenced LNCaP cells. Thus, AR acts as a positive regulator of ZEB2 expression in androgen-dependent cells and as a negative regulator in AI PCa cells.}

 abstract     = {Quetiapine (Seroquel) is an orally administered atypical antipsychotic that is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression. An extended-release (XR) formulation of quetiapine is also available. This review summarizes the pharmacological properties, efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine and quetiapine XR in patients with bipolar depression. Quetiapine is an antagonist at both serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors, and its antipsychotic effects are thought to stem from interactions at these receptors. The antidepressant effects of quetiapine are poorly understood, but may be related to antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors in cortical regions, partial agonism of 5-HT1A in the prefrontal cortex in association with increased extracellular dopamine release in the region, or to reduced synaptic reuptake of noradrenaline resulting from inhibition of the noradrenaline reuptake transporter by the quetiapine metabolite norquetiapine. The efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine was evaluated in five 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre or multinational trials in patients with a major depressive episode (MDE) associated with bipolar disorder. Across trials, monotherapy with oral quetiapine 300 or 600mg/day (or quetiapine XR 300mg/day) produced significantly greater improvements than placebo in depressive symptoms (primary endpoint), according to the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. In general, quetiapine and quetiapine XR were also associated with significantly higher MDE response and remission rates than placebo. Across trials, quetiapine and quetiapine XR produced significantly greater improvements in global severity of illness scores than placebo, according to changes in the Clinical Global Impressions scale score. There were no differences in treatment outcomes between quetiapine 300mg/day and 600mg/day dosage groups. Patients with bipolar depression who responded to quetiapine during two 8-week acute treatment trials also benefited from continuing quetiapine therapy for up to 52 weeks. Compared with quetiapine responders randomized to placebo, quetiapine responders who continued quetiapine 300 or 600mg/day had a significantly reduced risk of recurrence of any mood events and of depression mood events, but not of hypomanic/manic events. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, quetiapine maintenance therapy for up to 104 weeks was more efficacious than placebo or lithium in prolonging the time to recurrence of any mood event (primary endpoint). Patients in this trial had bipolar I disorder with mania, depression or a mixed episode as the index episode, and the trial included only patients who were responsive to acute phase quetiapine, which may have introduced a positive bias in favour of quetiapine over lithium during maintenance therapy. Quetiapine 300 or 600mg/day and quetiapine XR 300mg/day was generally well tolerated in patients with bipolar depression, with most treatment-emergent adverse events being of mild to moderate severity. The most frequent adverse events occurring during the acute treatment phase were dry mouth, sedation, somnolence, dizziness (quetiapine and quetiapine XR), constipation (quetiapine) and increased appetite (quetiapine XR). Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) occurred across quetiapine and placebo groups, but there were no significant differences between quetiapine and placebo recipients on objective measures of EPS and akathisia. In some trials, quetiapine recipients experienced significantly greater weight gain than placebo recipients. Across trials, some quetiapine recipients had clinically relevant increases in blood glucose or lipid parameters, although these also occurred in patients from other treatment groups. The clinical significance of these changes is uncertain. In conclusion, quetiapine and quetiapine XR are valuable additions to the first-line treatments for bipolar depression. Further head-to-head trials of quetiapine versus other drug regimens that are effective in bipolar depression would be of considerable interest.}

A series of logistic regressions identified patterns of health services use that may signal imminent eviction.RESULTS: Veterans with a drug use disorder and those who received inpatient, emergency, or outpatient care related to mental/behavioral health and substance use conditions proximal to program exit had greater risk for eviction. Receipt of outpatient primary medical care and supportive services was generally protective against eviction. The likelihood of eviction was greatest for Veterans with acute care use within 30days of exit.DISCUSSION: PSH providers may use these correlates of eviction to identify Veterans in need of an intervention to prevent eviction. Future work should focus on operationalizing these findings and identifying appropriate interventions.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapies for the hormone-dependent stages of prostate cancer have become so effective that new forms of chemoresistant tumors are emerging in clinical practice, and require new targeted therapies in the metastatic setting. Yet there are important gaps in our understanding of the relevant transcriptional networks driving this process. Progression from localized to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) occurs as a result of accumulated resistance mechanisms that develop upon sustained androgen receptor (AR) suppression. Critical to this progression is the plastic nature by which prostate tumor cells transition from epithelial to mesenchymal states (EMT).METHODS: Here, using prostate cancer cell lines with different AR composition, we systematically manipulated somatic proteins of the Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal (BET) family (BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4) to determine which BET proteins influence EMT. We used the TCGA repository to correlate the expression of individual BET genes with key EMT genes and determined biochemical recurrence in 414 patients and progression free survival in 488 patients.RESULTS: We found that only BRD4-and not BRD2 or BRD3-regulates the expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2, and that the downregulation of these EMT transcription factors significantly increases E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, of the BET genes, only BRD4 correlates with survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients. Moreover, selective degradation of BRD4 protein with MZ1 ablates EMT (transcriptionally and morphologically) induced by TGFSS signaling.CONCLUSIONS: Many relapsed/refractory tumors share a neuroendocrine transcriptional signature that had been relatively rare until highly successful antiandrogen drugs like abiraterone and enzalutamide came into widespread use. New therapeutic targets must therefore be developed. Our results identify key EMT genes regulated by BRD4, and offers a novel druggable target to treat mCRPC. BRD4-selective protein degraders offer a promising next generation approach to treat the emerging forms of chemoresistance in advanced prostate cancer.}

However, prolonged androgen deprivation results eventually in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) with metastasis and poor survival. Emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may facilitate castration-resistance and cancer metastasis in PCa. The human androgen-dependent, castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) cell line LNCaP and the CRPC cell line C4-2 are often used as a model system for human PCa. However, the role of the AR and the effect of AR antagonist (antiandrogen) treatment on the RNA expression of key factors of EMT including the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) DRAIC in PCa cells remain elusive. Although as expected the established AR target genes PSA and FKBP5 are strongly induced by androgens in both cell lines, both E-cadherin and vimentin mRNA levels are upregulated by androgens in LNCaP but not in C4-2 cells by short- and long-term treatments. The mRNA levels of E-cadherin and vimentin remain unchanged by antiandrogen treatment in both cell lines. The expression of transcription factors that regulate EMT including Slug, Snail and ZEB1 and the lncRNA DRAIC were affected by androgen treatment in both cell lines. The mRNA level of Slug is upregulated by androgens and interestingly downregulated by antiandrogens in both cell lines. On the other hand, ZEB1 mRNA levels are strongly upregulated by androgens but remain unchanged by antiandrogens. In contrast, Snail mRNA levels are repressed by androgen treatment similar to DRAIC RNA levels. However, while antiandrogen treatment seems not to change Snail mRNA levels, antiandrogen treatments induce DRAIC RNA levels. Moreover, despite the strong upregulation of Zeb1 mRNA, no significant increase of the ZEB1 protein was observed indicating that despite androgen upregulation, posttranscriptional regulation of EMT controlling transcription factors occurs. SLUG protein was enhanced in both cell lines by androgens and reduced by antiandrogens. Taken together, our data suggest that the ligand-activated AR regulates the expression of several EMT key factors and antiandrogens counteract AR activity only on selected genes.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Tracheal intubation is the gold standard in emergency airway management. One way of measuring intubation quality is first pass success rate (FPSR). Mastery of tracheal intubation and maintenance of the skill is challenging for non-anesthesiologists. A combination of individual measures can increase FPSR. Videolaryngoscopy is an important tool augmenting laryngeal visualization. Bougie-first strategy can further improve FPSR in difficult airways. Standardized positioning maneuvers and manipulation of the soft tissues can enhance laryngeal visualization. Fresh frozen cadavers (FFC) are superior models compared to commercially manufactured manikins. By purposefully manipulating FFCs, it is possible to mimic the pre-hospital intubation conditions of helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS).METHODS: Twenty-four trauma surgeons (12 per Group, NOVICES: no pre-hospital experience, HEMS: HEMS physicians) completed an airway training course using FFCs. The FFCs were modified to match airway characteristics of 60 prospectively documented intubations by HEMS physicians prior to the study (BASELINE). In four scenarios the local HEMS airway standard (1: unaided direct laryngoscopy (DL), OLD) was compared to two scenarios with modifications of the intubation technique (2: augmented DL (bougie and patient positioning), 3: augmented videolaryngoscopy (aVL)) and a control scenario (4: VL and bougie, positioning by participant, CONTROL). FPSR, POGO score, Cormack and Lehane grade and duration of intubation were recorded. No participant had anesthesiological qualifications or experience in VL.RESULTS: The comparison between CONTROL and BASELINE revealed a significant increase of FPSR and achieved C{\&}L grade for HEMS group (FPSR 100{\%}, absolute difference 23{\%}, p≤.001). The use of videolaryngoscopy, bougie, and the application of positioning techniques required significantly more time in the CONTROL scenario (HEMS group: mean 34.0s (IQR 28.3-47.5), absolute difference to BASELINE: 13.0s, p=.045). The groups differed significantly in the median number of real-life intubations performed in any setting (NOVICES n=5 (IQR 0-18.75), HEMS n=68 (IQR 37.25-99.75)). In the control scenario no significant differences were found between both groups. The airway characteristics of the FFC showed no significant differences compared to BASELINE.CONCLUSION: Airway characteristics of a pre-hospital patient reference group cared for by HEMS were successfully reproduced in a fresh frozen cadaver model. In this setting, a combination of evidence based airway management techniques results in high FPSR and POGO rates of non-anesthesiological trained users. Comparable results (FPSR, POGO, duration of intubation) were achieved regardless of previous provider experience. The BOAH concept can therefore be used in the early stages of airway training and for skill maintenance.}

We analyzed GPS coordinates of ambulance assignments for seizures in Vastra Gotalandsregionen, a health care region in western Sweden with 1.7 million inhabitants, and correlated the number of assignments to socioeconomic data. As expected, epilepsy was more common in areas of lower socioeconomic level, but this correlation was weak. Ambulance assignments for seizures were more common in socioeconomically weaker areas, even when the higher prevalence of epilepsy was taken into account. Possible, not mutually exclusive, explanations include more severe epilepsy, lower ambitions in the epilepsy care provided, and/or differences in health care utilization behavior. The study illustrates the relevance of the 2019 national guidelines for improved equal access to epilepsy care. Data on socioeconomic parameters and prehospital care can be valuable for improvement of epilepsy care.}

However, only about 20{\%} of infants with a clinical phenotype akin to PAIS have an AR mutation. We aimed to identify clinical features associated with the presence of an AR mutation.METHODS: The external masculinisation score (EMS; normal=12), birth weight (BW), gestational age and BW SD score (BW-SDS) of 164 infants with a 'PAIS-like' phenotype were analysed in the Cambridge Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) Database, of whom 128 (78{\%}) had no AR mutation ('AR mutation-negative') and 36 (22{\%}) had an AR mutation ('AR mutation-positive').RESULTS: The EMS was similar in AR mutation-negative and AR mutation-positive infants (median, IQR: 5.0, 3.0 to 6.0 vs 4.8, 3.0 to 6.0; p=0.33). AR mutation-negative infants had lower BW (2.33, 1.38 to 3.20 vs 3.18, 2.87 to 3.61 kg; p<0.001), lower gestational age (37.0, 34.0 to 40.0 vs 40.0, 39.0 to 40.0 weeks; p<0.001), and lower BW-SDS (-1.31, -2.33 to -0.46 vs -0.57, -1.19 to 0.33; p=0.001) compared to AR mutation-positive infants. More AR mutation-negative infants (47/128; 37{\%}) than AR mutation-positive infants (2/36; 6{\%}) had BW-SDS <-2 (p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The severity of genital anomalies in this large cohort of infants with a 'PAIS-like' phenotype did not differentiate their AR status. Almost all the infants born small-for-gestational-age do not have an AR mutation. A category of 'XY DSD and fetal growth restriction, as yet unexplained' should be recognised.}

 abstract     = {Illegal drug smugglings and crimes have long been a global concern, and an apparatus which can identify drugs on-the-spot is urgently demanded by law enforcement. A thermal desorption acetone-assisted photoionization miniature ion trap mass spectrometer was developed for on-site and rapid identification of illegal drugs at checkpoints. Acetone was chosen for dopant-assisted photoionization, and the sensitivity of selected drugs was further enhanced with protonated analyte molecular ions [M + H]+. For example, the sensitivity of ephedrine was improved by as high as 22-fold. The mass discrimination effect, which was usually considered as a shortcoming of ion trap mass analyzer, was ingeniously utilized to eliminate the protonated acetone reagent ions and maximize the trapping efficiency of analyte ions in mass analyzer. Twenty-seven drugs were analyzed, and the limits of detection (LODs) of selected illegal drugs were at the nanogram level with analysis time of 2 s. Analyte/dopant ion peak intensity ratios in mass spectra could be used for quantitation to improve the quantitative analysis performance of miniature ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a discontinuous atmospheric pressure interface (DAPI) with the prerequisite that dopant ions and analyte ions could be simultaneously and effectively trapped by the ion trap. The RSD of signal intensity was reduced from 25.3{\%} to 8.5{\%}, and the linear range was extended from 0.5-25 to 0.5-100 ng/muL for methamphetamine. A temperature-resolved thermal desorption sampling strategy was developed and used to distinguish illegal drug components in plant-based drug samples and drinks containing illegal drugs.}

As accumulating evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate important cancer hallmarks, we hypothesised that AR-regulated lncRNAs might play roles in TNBC progression. Here, we performed experiments with or without DHT treatment in three TNBC cell lines, and we identified an AR negatively induced lncRNA (ARNILA), which correlated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) in TNBC patients and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, we demonstrated that ARNILA functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-204 to facilitate expression of its target gene Sox4, which is known to induce EMT and contribute to breast cancer progression, thereby promoting EMT, invasion and metastasis of TNBC. Our findings not only provide new insights into the mechanisms of lncRNA in regulating AR but also suggest ARNILA as an alternative therapeutic target to suppress metastasis of TNBC patients.}

Patient surveys provided data on demographics, general health, and symptoms and/or comorbidities associated with depression. Similar clinical conditions also were identified from the medical claims. Factors associated with high utilization were identified using logistic regression models.RESULTS: Of 3132 survey respondents, 1921 were included, 193 of whom were HUds (defined as those who incurred the top 10{\%} of total all-cause costs in the preceding 12months). Mean total annual healthcare costs were eightfold greater for HUds than for non-HUds ({\$}US56,145 vs. {\$}US6,954; p<.0001). HUds incurred more inpatient encounters (p<.0001) and emergency department (p=.01) and physician office visits (p<.0001). Similar findings were observed for mental healthcare costs/resource use. HUds were prescribed twice as many medications (total mean: 16.86 vs. 8.32; psychotropic mean: 4.11 vs. 2.61; both p<.0001). HUds reported higher levels of depression severity, fatigue, sleep difficulties, pain, high alcohol consumption, and anxiety. Predictors of becoming a HUd included substance use, obesity, cardiovascular disease, comorbidity severity, psychiatric conditions other than depression, and pain.CONCLUSION: Focusing on pain, substance use, and psychiatric conditions beyond depression may be effective approaches to reducing high costs in patients with depression.}

In the intent to treat (ITT) population in the first phase of the trial (AD2), responders to venlafaxine were 151 (36.21{\%}) out of which remitters were 83 (19.90{\%}). After phase one, 170 non-responders, defined as TRD, were included in the second phase and 157 completed the course.

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a biological marker that reflects an individual's autonomic nervous system regulation. Psychological resilience is an individual's ability to recover from an adverse event and return to physiological homeostasis and mental well-being, indicated by higher resting HRV. The Biofeedback Assisted Resilience Training (BART) study evaluates a resilience-building intervention, with or without HRV biofeedback. This article evaluates the feasibility of remote psychophysiological research by validating the HRV data collected.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BART platform consists of a mobile health application (BART app) paired to a wearable heart rate monitor. The BART app is installed on the participant's personal phone/tablet to track and collect self-report psychological and physiological data. The platform collects raw heart rate data and processes HRV to server as online biofeedback. The raw data is processed offline to derive HRV for statistical analysis. The following HRV parameters are validated: inter-beat interval, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, low-frequency HRV, biofeedback HRV, and heart period. Bland-Altman and scatter plots are used to compare and contrast online and offline HRV measures. Repeated-measures ANOVA are used to compared means across tasks during the stress (rest, stress, and recovery) and training (rest and paced breathing) sessions in order to validate autonomic nervous system changes to physiological challenges.RESULTS: The analyses included 245 participants. Bland-Altman plots showed excellent agreement and minimal bias between online and offline unedited inter-beat interval data during the stress session. RMANOVA during the training session indicated a significant strong effect on biofeedback HRV, F(11,390)=967.96, P<.01. During the stress session, RMANOVA showed significant strong effect on respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency HRV, and a significant but weak effect on heart period.CONCLUSIONS: The BART digital health platform supports remote behavioral and physiological data collection, intervention delivery, and online HRV biofeedback.}

We report specific problems associated with an ALS patient using an artificial respirator through home care support. A 68-year-old male had a back problem in 2001 and developed a sudden difficulty in breathing. Since 2002, the patient was forced to use an artificial respirator, and without taking his informed consent, was treated at home. Primary caregivers are his wife and daughter. The specific problems we identified are (1) patient's caregivers were unnecessary confused due to a lack of coordination between visiting nurses from two hospitals in giving home care treatment direction, (2) the care giver's burden tends to increase as the duration of care is extended because the short-stay facility or transferring system for patient is not well equipped, (3) there is no particular place to ask for assistance in case of an emergency or an established communication method as the patient's disease status will progress. It appears that these identified problems cannot be resolved by one hospital. However, we believe that we have to establish a community-wide home care system as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, it is important to have a nationwide coordination involving government, corporations, and political institutions to make it to be a success.}

Three different measurements were used to determine which recovery method was most effective; the difference in blood lactate (BLa) levels was used as a biological measurement, average pitching speed was the physiological measurement, and the psychological measurement was done on how the pitchers perceived their pitching and recovery. The recovery methods that were used were passive recovery (PR), active recovery (AR), and electromuscular stimulation (EMS). Seven college men aged 21 ({\textpm}2 years) who were National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II college baseball pitchers were assessed during game play simulations. Blood lactate levels decreased significantly from the premeasurement to the postmeasurement with the EMS recovery method (p < 0.0005); however, BLa did not change for PR (p = 0.017) or AR (p = 0.134). Perceived recovery was also found to be best in the EMS and PR conditions. These findings suggest that EMS is an effective recovery method between innings of pitching.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: Acquisition of anoikis resistance is a prerequisite for metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about how energy metabolism and antioxidant systems are altered in anoikis-resistant (AR) HCC cells. We evaluated anti-tumor effects of a combination treatment of 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in AR HCC cells.METHODS: We compared glycolysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and chemoresistance among Huh-BAT, HepG2 HCC cells, and the corresponding AR cells. Expression of hexokinase II, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (rGCS), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in AR cells was assessed. Anti-tumor effects of a combination treatment of 3-BP and BSO were evaluated in AR cells and an HCC xenograft mouse model.RESULTS: AR HCC cells showed significantly higher chemoresistance, glycolysis and lower ROS production than attached cells. Expression of hexokinase II, rGCS, and EMT markers was higher in AR HCC cells than attached cells. A combination treatment of 3-BP/BSO effectively suppressed proliferation of AR HCC cells through apoptosis by blocking glycolysis and enhancing ROS levels. In xenograft mouse models, tumor growth derived from AR HCC cells was significantly suppressed in the group treated with 3-BP/BSO compared to the group treated with 3-BP or sorafenib.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that a combination treatment of 3-BP/BSO had a synergistic anti-tumor effect in an AR HCC model. This strategy may be an effective adjuvant therapy for patients with sorafenib-resistant HCC.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer(PCa) is the most commonly occurring male cancer in the USA. Abiraterone or Enzalutamide have been approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the treatment-emergent neuroendocrine PCa (t-NEPC) may develop, resulting in drug resistance in about 10-17{\%} CRPC patients. The detailed mechanisms remain unclear..METHODS: The expression correlation of TOMM20 and AR in PCa was determined by analyzing publicly available datasets, or by IHC staining in tumor specimens. The protein interaction of TOMM20 and AR was validated by co-immunoprecipitation or GST pull-down assay. The impact of TOMM20 depletion on drug sensitivity were elucidated by assays of cell proliferation, invasion, sphere formation, xenograft growth and intravenous metastasis. The intracellular ROS level was measured by flow cytometry, and the NEPC transdifferentiation and characteristics of cancer stem-like cells were validated by RNA-seq, RT-PCR and western blotting.RESULTS: The protein level of TOMM20 is positively correlated with AR in PCa cells and specimens. TOMM20 protein physically interacts with AR. AR antagonists induced the protein degradation of TOMM20 through autophagy-lysosomal pathway, thereby elevating the intracellular ROS level and activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. When TOMM20 was depleted, PCa cells underwent EMT, acquired the characteristics of cancer stem-like cells, and developed resistance to AR antagonists. The stable depletion of TOMM20 promoted the transdifferentiation of PCa adenocarcinoma into NEPC and metastasis. Conversely, the rescue of TOMM20 re-sensitized the resistant PCa cells to AR antagonists.CONCLUSIONS: TOMM20 protein degradation induced by AR antagonists promoted the transdifferentiation of PCa to NEPC, thereby revealing a novel molecular mechanism by which AR antagonists develop drug resistance through mitochondrial outer membrane-mediated signaling pathway. These findings suggested that the decreasing or loss of TOMM20 expression in PCa tissues might become a useful predictor of PCa resistance to AR antagonists.}

We used a mixed-method approach that applied qualitative and quantitative measures in describing the CPS role and evaluating PIM rates. PIMs were defined using the 2012 Beers Criteria. We reported monthly PIM rates in patients aged 65 years and older who were discharged from the ED from January 2012 to November 2014. A piecewise, nonlinear regression model evaluated the pattern in PIM prescriptions over time.RESULTS: At the Durham, North Carolina, VA Medical Center, a total of 4 CPS were involved with tailoring the design and implementation of the EQUiPPED intervention for local use. CPS input led to 3 key innovations: academic detailing performed by a physician-CPS pair, medication alert messages identifying medications as PIMs in the computerized patient record system, and automated reports describing the frequency and type of PIMs prescribed by each ED provider. Between February 2013 and November 2014, 73 ED providers received the academic detailing. The ED facility experienced a relative reduction of 47.5{\%} in the rate of PIM prescribing over the observation period.CONCLUSIONS: This QI project resulted in a meaningful decrease in PIM prescribing in older ED adults. CPS contributions to QI can extend beyond pharmacotherapy and provider education to also include information technology tools using formulary management expertise.}

 abstract     = {Ever since Becker (1968) there have been numerous tangible accomplishments by law-andeconomics scholars regarding rational decisions of criminals, optimal law enforcement, relative advantages of different types of punishment, or incentives of law enforcers, to name a few.Nevertheless, research on`what is crime?'has been relatively scarce in the field of law and economics.In many earlier studies, crime was regarded as illegal activities subject to criminal punishment; there obviously was`circularity'in the definition of crime. Some adopted an`abstract'definition such as very harmful activities. Also, other studies took the crime category in question`as a given.'It was only the mid 1980s that efforts were made in full force to overcome the circularity, abstractness, and exogeneity underlying the definition of crime. The goal of this paper is two-fold: that is, to integrate these efforts made so far in explaining what crime and (the purpose of) criminal punishment are, and to explore the comprehensive principles by which one can explain varying types of crime warranting criminal punishment. In particular, the paper has three distinct features: First, similarities and differences among the preceding theories are explicitly elaborated. Second, criticisms are made and,subsequently, alternative arguments are newly offered when extant theories are not believed to be sufficient enough to explain reality adequately. Third, when necessary for readers to better understand the major theme of this paper, I provide not only corresponding arguments conventionally developed from jurisprudence or criminology, but actual substantive laws in Korea closely related to the specific issue under consideration. The paper concludes that the major determinants of culpability are intention, direct and extended harm, and asset insufficiency, and that criminal punishment should be used only when activities clearly manifest themselves a very high level of culpability. Otherwise, the harmful activities must be deterred by alternative sanctioning mechanisms such as administrative penalties and civil liabilities.}

Three types of AR were calculated from wavefront aberration data based on ocular foci within a paraxial area, natural pupil area, and a 3.5 mm-diameter annular pupil area. The accommodative stimulus response curves (ASRCs) were compared between the three groups and between the three AR conditions.RESULTS: The difference in the slope of ASRC was significant between the three AR conditions (p < 0.0001) but it was not significant between the three refractive groups. In each group, the slope of ASRC for the accommodative response measured within the paraxial area of the pupil (paraxial AR) was significantly steeper than that measured for the natural pupil (total AR) and also for that estimated for the 3.5 mm-diameter annular pupil (p < 0.01). The difference in the y-intercept of ASRC between the three AR conditions was also significant (p = 0.02) but not between the three refractive groups. The y-intercept of ASRC for paraxial AR was more positive than that for total AR in SMs (p < 0.01) and in PMs (p < 0.05); the y-intercept of ASRC for the 3.5 mm peripheral AR was more positive than that for total AR in SMs (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The spherical aberration of the eye has a significant effect on the slope of ASRC and is less in PMs than in EMs and SMs.}

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of USL255 (including treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs]). The secondary objective was to assess seizure frequency in patients (e.g., median percent reduction from baseline in weekly POS frequency, responder rate [proportion of patients with ≥25{\%}, ≥50{\%}, ≥75{\%}, or 100{\%} reduction from baseline in POS frequency], and seizure-free intervals [proportion of patients who were seizure-free for 4, 12, 24, 36, or 48weeks]). Exploratory clinical-status endpoints included the Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy-Problems (QOLIE-31-P) questionnaires. Post hoc analyses evaluated neurocognitive TEAE incidences during the first 11 and entire 55weeks of treatment and efficacy by patient age and drug-resistant status.RESULTS: Of the 217 patients who completed PREVAIL (USL255, n=103; placebo, n=114), 210 (97{\%}) enrolled in PREVAIL OLE and were included in the ITT population. Across the entire 55-week treatment period, USL255 was generally safe and well tolerated, with low individual neurocognitive TEAE incidences. Seizure reduction was sustained across the year-long study and observed in patient subgroups, including those with highly drug-resistant seizures and those ≥50years of age. Improvements in CGI-C and QOLIE-31-P were also observed.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of PREVAIL OLE are consistent with those from PREVAIL and demonstrate that adjunctive treatment with up to 400mg/day of USL255 may be a safe and effective treatment option for a variety of adult patients with refractory POS.}

In this review, we will discuss the switches between different cell fates that occur in response to AR blockade or acquisition of specific oncogenic mutations, such as those in TP53 and RB1, during the evolution to CRPC. We highlight the urgent need to dissect the mechanistic underpinnings of these transitions and identify novel vulnerabilities that can be targeted therapeutically.}

Although great progress has been made in diagnosis and treatment strategies in recent years, the 5-year survival rate of OSCC patients is still disappointingly low. Hence, there is still an unmet medical need for sufferers with OSCC. As a downstream effector of Hippo pathway, TAZ was up-regulated in multiple cancers including OSCC, and considered as an effective therapeutic target. In this study, we constructed a stable transfected cell line HEK293-TAZ to screen TAZ inhibitor using dual-luciferase reporter assay, and found a potential TAZ inhibitor AR-42. The results showed that AR-42 effectively suppressed the viability and proliferation of OSCC cells, and induced cellular apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Moreover, AR-42 potently inhibited cell invasion and the capacity of sphere-forming, as well as the expression of EMT and cancer stem cell related proteins in OSCC cells, exhibiting potential efficacy against OSCC metastasis and self-renewal of oral cancer stem cell. Further mechanism studies showed that AR-42 inhibited the total amount of TAZ and its paralog YAP mainly through blockade of TAZ/YAP transcription and promotion of TAZ/YAP protein degradation. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of AR-42 against TAZ, as well as its anti-OSCC activity could be also observed in SCC9 xenograft model. Taken together, AR-42 deserves to be further studied as a TAZ inhibitor, and is worthy to be further assessed as a potential drug candidate for OSCC treatment.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells is a prerequisite to cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This process involves a network of molecular alterations. Androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in the biology of breast cancers, particularly those dependent on AR expression like luminal AR (LAR) breast cancer subtype. We have recently reported that the AR agonist, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), induces a mesenchymal transition of MDA-MB-453 cells, concomitant with transcriptional up-regulation of Slug and regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2).OBJECTIVE: The role of Slug and RGS2 in mediating the DHT-induced effects in these cells was investigated.METHODS: MDA-MB-453 cells were used as a model system of LAR breast cancer. Immunofluorescence was used to examine cell morphology and protein localization. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. Protein localization was confirmed by cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting. Protein-protein interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Transwell membranes were used to assess cell migration. Transfection of cells with siRNA molecules that target Slug and RGS2 mRNA was utilized to delineate the modes of action of these two molecules.RESULTS: Treatment of MDA-MB-453 cells with DHT induced the expression of both proteins. In addition, AR-Slug, AR-RGS2, and Slug-RGS2 interactions were observed shortly after AR activation. Knocking down Slug abrogated the basal, but not the DHT-induced, cell migration and blocked DHT-induced mesenchymal transition. On the other hand, RGS2 knocked-down cells had an increased level of Slug protein and assumed mesenchymal cell morphology with induced migration, and the addition of DHT further elongated cell morphology and stimulated their migration. Inhibition of AR or beta-catenin reverted the RGS2 knocked-down cells to the epithelial phenotype, but only inhibition of AR blocked their DHT-induced migration.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the involvement of RGS2 and Slug in a complex molecular network regulating the DHT-induced mesenchymal features in MDA-MB-453 cells. The study may offer a better understanding of the biological role of AR in breast cancer toward devising AR-based therapeutic strategies.}

J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 763-771, 2022-Firefighters experience a range of stressors that impair performance and elevate the risk for developing cardiometabolic diseases. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) has been shown to mitigate markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and serve as an alternative fuel with implications to physical performance. On 2 occasions in a double-blind, counterbalanced, and crossover design, 14 professional firefighters performed a live-burn, search and rescue (S{\&}R) 30 minutes after ingestion of a ketone monoester (KME; 0.5 g{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) or a placebo (PLA). Dependent variables collected before and after the S{\&}R included salivary markers of stress and inflammation (cortisol, alpha-amylase, interleukin-1 beta, uric acid), perceptual markers (profile of mood state [POMS]), gastrointestinal distress (GI), rating of perceived exertion [RPE]), time to completion, and capillary blood measurement of betaHB and glucose. KME resulted in capillary betaHB concentrations of approximately 2.1-3.2 mM throughout the protocol. Capillary glucose concentrations were lower for the KME compared with PLA (7{\%}) (interaction effect, p < 0.001). Salivary markers of stress, GI, and time to complete the S{\&}R (10 minutes) did not differ between trials, although KME ingestion resulted in significantly higher RPE after the live-burn S{\&}R (KME,6 {\textpm} 1; PLA, 4 {\textpm} 1). However, POMS data showed the KME also lowered subjective states of nervousness (KME, 0.0 {\textpm} 0.0; PLA, 0.6 {\textpm} 0.8) and anxiety (KME, 0.0 {\textpm} 0.0; PLA, 0.6 {\textpm} 0.7) before the S{\&}R (all p < 0.05; large effect sizes). Compared with PLA, ingestion of a KME by firefighters did not mitigate the rise in various markers of salivary stress or impact physical performance during a live-burn S{\&}R. However, differences in RPE and POMS variables were observed, suggesting a possible cognitive role for betaHB.}

 abstract     = {Background: We analyzed mRNA profiles of prostate cancer related genes in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of primary, non-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (pts) before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to elucidate the potential of prostate cancer targets in this BC subgroup. Method: Blood from 41 TNBC pts (n = 41 before / 26 after therapy) was analyzed for CTCs applying the AdnaTest EMT-2/Stem Cell Select. Multimarker RT-qPCR allowed the detection of the prostate specific antigen PSA, the prostate specific membrane antigen PSMA, full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL), and AR splice-variant seven (AR-V7). Results: Before therapy, at least one prostate cancer related gene was detected in 15/41 pts (37{\%}). Notably, in 73{\%} of AR-FL positive cases, AR-V7 was co-expressed. After therapy, CTCs of only one patient harbored prostate cancer related genes. AR-V7+ and PSMA+ CTCs significantly correlated with early relapse (p = 0.041; p = 0.00039) whereas PSMA+ CTCs also associated with a reduced OS (p = 0.0059). This correlation was confirmed for PSMA+ CTCs in univariate (PFS p = 0.002; OS p = 0.015), but not multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Although CTCs that expressed prostate cancer related genes were eliminated by the given therapy, PSMA+ CTCs significantly identified pts at high risk for relapse. Furthermore, AR inhibition, often discussed for this BC subgroup, might not be successful in the primary setting of the disease since we identified AR-FL+ CTCs together with AR-V7+ CTCs, associated with therapeutic failure.}

 abstract     = {The role of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis in the progression of prostate cancer is a cornerstone to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Resistance of advanced prostate cancer to available treatment options makes it a clinical challenge that results in approximately 30,000 deaths of American men every year. Since the historic discovery by Dr. Huggins more than 70 years ago, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the principal treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Initially, ADT induces apoptosis of androgen-dependent prostate cancer epithelial cells and regression of androgen-dependent tumors. However, the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer progress and become refractory to ADT due to emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells driven by aberrant AR activation. Microtubule-targeting agents such as taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel, have enjoyed success in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer; although new, recently designed mitosis-specific agents, such as the polo-kinase and kinesin-inhibitors, have yielded clinically disappointing results. Docetaxel, as a first-line chemotherapy, improves prostate cancer patient survival by months, but tumor resistance to these therapeutic agents inevitably develops. On a molecular level, progression to CRPC is characterized by aberrant AR expression, de novo intraprostatic androgen production, and cross talk with other oncogenic pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that reactivation of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) processes may facilitate the development of not only prostate cancer but also prostate cancer metastases. EMT is characterized by gain of mesenchymal characteristics and invasiveness accompanied by loss of cell polarity, with an increasing number of studies focusing on the direct involvement of androgen-AR signaling axis in EMT, tumor progression, and therapeutic resistance. In this article, we discuss the current knowledge of mechanisms via which the AR signaling drives therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer metastatic progression and the novel therapeutic interventions targeting AR in CRPC.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Manual palpation (MP) is frequently employed for pulse checks, but studies have shown that trained medical personnel have difficulty accurately identifying pulselessness or return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) using MP. Any delays in identifying pulselessness can lead to significant delays in starting or resuming high-quality chest compressions.OBJECTIVES: This study explored whether femoral arterial Doppler ultrasound (FADU) decreases pulse check duration during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) compared with MP among patients in the emergency department (ED) receiving CPR directed by emergency medicine physicians who had received minimal additional didactic ultrasound training.METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study from October 2018 to May 2019 at an urban community ED. Using convenience sampling, we enrolled patients arriving at our ED or who decompensated during their ED stay and received CPR. For continuous data, median (interquartile range [IQR]) were calculated, and medians were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: Fifty-two eligible patients were enrolled and 135 pulse checks via MP and 35 via FADU were recorded. MP observations had a median (IQR) of 11.00 (7.36-15.48) s, whereas FADU had a median (IQR) of 8.98 (5.45-13.85) s. There was a difference between the two medians of 2.02 s (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the use of FADU was superior to MP in achieving shorter pulse check times. Further research is needed to confirm the accuracy of FADU for identifying ROSC as well as to determine whether FADU can improve clinical outcomes.}

 abstract     = {Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) frequently develop therapeutic resistance to taxane chemotherapy and antiandrogens. Cabazitaxel is a second-line taxane chemotherapeutic agent that provides additional survival benefits to patients with advanced disease. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanism of action of combined cabazitaxel and androgen receptor (AR) targeting in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer. We found that cabazitaxel induced mitotic spindle collapse and multinucleation by targeting the microtubule depolymerizing kinesins and inhibiting AR. In androgen-responsive tumors, treatment with the AR inhibitor, enzalutamide, overcame resistance to cabazitaxel. Combination treatment of human CRPC xenografts with cabazitaxel and enzalutamide reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and led to multinucleation, while retaining nuclear AR. In a transgenic mouse model of androgen-responsive prostate cancer, cabazitaxel treatment induced MET, glandular redifferentiation, and AR nuclear localization that was inhibited by androgen deprivation. Collectively, our preclinical studies demonstrate that prostate tumor resistance to cabazitaxel can be overcome by antiandrogen-mediated EMT-MET cycling in androgen-sensitive tumors but not in CRPC. Moreover, AR splice variants may preclude patients with advanced disease from responding to cabazitaxel chemotherapy and antiandrogen combination therapy. This evidence enables a significant insight into therapeutic cross-resistance to taxane chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer.}

 abstract     = {Diabetic cataract (DC), an identified life-threatening secondary complication of diabetes mellitus, has proven to be a dilemma because of its multifactorial caused and progression. An increasing number of studies have shown that in addition to the maillard reaction, enhanced polyol pathway, and oxidative insults, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to the prevalence of DC. Quercetin, a classic flavonoid with multiple pharmacological effects has been reported to possess therapeutic efficacy in the management and treatment of this disease. However, the mechanism underlying its therapeutic efficacy in EMT of lens epithelial cells (SRA01/04) and contribution to resolving DC remains a mystery. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of quercetin on EMT of SRA01/04 and high-glucose (HG)-induced lens opacity accompanied by lens fibrosis induced by type-1 diabetes. Furthermore, we sought to clarify the specific mechanisms underlying these effects. At week 14 after streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneal administration, diabetic rats showed lens opacity accompanied with diminished antioxidant function, enhanced polyol pathway activity, and non-enzymatic glycation. Western blotting confirmed EMT in rat SRA01/04cells with significantly increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and decreased E-cadherin expressions. Treatment of the lens with quercetin ameliorated the oxidative stress, inhibited aldose reductase (AR) activation, reduced advanced glycation end product (AGE) production, and finally suppressed EMT in the early stages. Our invitro results showed that high-glucose activated the transforming growth factor-beta2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (TGF-beta2/PI3K/Akt) signalling and EMT in SRA01/04cells. Further, induced oxidative stress, activation of aldose reductase, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products were also involved in this process. Quercetin was potent enough to effectively ameliorate the high glucose (HG)-induced EMT of SRA01/04cells by inhibiting the activation of TGF-beta2/PI3K/Akt, enhancing the antioxidant capacity, inhibiting AR activity, and reducing AGE production. From the whole animal to tissues, and finally the cellular level, our results provide considerable evidence of the therapeutic potential of quercetin for DC. This might be due to its inhibition of EMT mediated through inhibition of the TGF-beta/PI3K/Akt pathway.}

The designed lattices were fabricated in two elastomers using different additive manufacturing processes: (a) vat photopolymerization (with compliant SIL30 elastomer from Carbon) and (b) thermoplastic material extrusion (with Ultimaker TPU filament providing increased stiffness). Both materials provided unique benefits with the SIL30 material offering compliance suitable for lower energy impacts and the Ultimaker TPU offering improved protection against higher impact energies. Moreover, a hybrid lattice combination of both materials was evaluated and demonstrated the simultaneous benefits of each, with good performance across a wider range of impact energies. This study explores the design, material, and process space for manufacturing a new class of comfortable, energy-absorbing protective equipment to protect athletes, consumers, soldiers, first responders, and packaged goods.}

Two of the studies included extension phases of up to 6 months, the results of which were also analyzed here.RESULTS: The earliest symptoms to respond included both psychic symptoms (anxious mood, tension, behavior at interview) and somatic muscular, cardiovascular, and respiratory symptoms. The last symptoms to respond included the psychic symptoms of insomnia and fear and the somatic sensory, gastrointestinal and autonomic symptoms, perhaps in part because of drug-related side effects. Continuing treatment beyond 8 weeks in venlafaxine ER responders for up to 6 months of total treatment results not only in additional improvement in early-responding symptoms, but also in the improvement of late-responding symptoms, perhaps due in part to the development of tolerance to antidepressant side effects.CONCLUSION: Serious consideration should be given to maintaining partial responders to venlafaxine ER treatment on the same treatment for > or = 3-6 months.}

Changes in the expression of desmocollin-2 (DSC2) have been noted during tumor progression into an invasive phenotype and as cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We have previously reported that breast MDA-MB-453 cancer cells, a luminal androgen receptor (AR) model of triple-negative breast cancer, acquire mesenchymal features when treated with the AR agonist, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). We have therefore investigated androgen regulation of the expression and cellular localization of DSC2 in MDA-MB-453 cells. Treatment of the cells with DHT resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in DSC2 protein levels and dispersion of its membrane localization concomitant with AR- and beta-catenin-mediated mesenchymal transition of cells. A significant correlation was revealed between decreased expression of AR and increased expression of DSC2 in patient samples. In addition, whereas lower expression of AR was associated with a reduced overall and recurrence-free survival of breast cancer patients, higher expression of DSC2 was found in invasive breast tumors than in normal breast cells and was correlated with lower patient survival. Upon knocking down DSC2, the cells became elongated, mesenchymal-like, and slightly, but insignificantly, more migratory. The addition of DHT further stimulated cell elongation and migration. DSC2 siRNA-transfected cells reverted to a normal epithelial morphology upon inhibition of beta-catenin. These results highlight the role of DSC2 in maintaining the epithelial morphology of MDA-MB-453 cells and the negative regulation of the desmosomal protein by DHT during stimulation of the androgen-induced, beta-catenin-mediated mesenchymal transition of the cells.}

Phoenix Rising is however usurped in cancer, potentially nullifying pro-apoptotic therapies. Cytotoxic therapies also promote cancer cell plasticity through epigenetic reprogramming, leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), chemo-resistance and tumor progression. We explored the relationship between such scenarios, setting-up an innovative, straightforward one-pot in vitro model of therapy-induced prostate cancer repopulation. Cancer (castration-resistant PC3 and androgen-sensitive LNCaP), or normal (RWPE-1) prostate cells, are treated with etoposide and left recovering for 18 days. After a robust apoptotic phase, PC3 setup a coordinate tissue-like response, repopulating and acquiring EMT and chemo-resistance; repopulation occurs via Phoenix Rising, being dependent on high PGE-2 levels achieved through caspase-3-promoted signaling; epigenetic inhibitors interrupt Phoenix Rising after PGE-2, preventing repopulation. Instead, RWPE-1 repopulate via Phoenix Rising without reprogramming, EMT or chemo-resistance, indicating that only cancer cells require reprogramming to complete Phoenix Rising. Intriguingly, LNCaP stop Phoenix-Rising after PGE-2, failing repopulating, suggesting that the propensity to engage/complete Phoenix Rising may influence the outcome of pro-apoptotic therapies. Concluding, we established a reliable system where to study prostate cancer repopulation, showing that epigenetic reprogramming assists Phoenix Rising to promote post-therapy cancer repopulation and acquired cell-resistance (CRAC).}

 abstract     = {Urban areas are typically warmer than nearby rural areas, especially during hot weather. This increases heat exposure, morbidity, and mortality rates of urban residents. Heat adaption methods can improve public safety during heat events, but the availability and usage of these resources vary based on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as personal perception of warmth. Heat events are often studied using city- and neighborhood-level meteorological and socioeconomic data, which do not reflect individual exposure or access to and use of heat adaption resources. We collected lifestyle surveys and individually experienced temperature and humidity data for 38 Knoxville, Tennessee, residents during a heatwave and a period of climatically normal summer conditions. Participants were less exposed to heat during the daytime than airport conditions suggest, indicating successful use of heat adaption methods, such as staying indoors. Some participants were warmer at night and during the non-heatwave period. Heat inequality is especially problematic at night, with older, less educated, and lower-income individuals being more exposed to heat. Even when exposed to dangerous heat levels, participants were less likely to take adaption actions to protect themselves from heat-health effects during the non-heatwave period and at night because they do not perceive themselves as being at risk or have the resources to do so. These findings signal the need for improved heat education, as future climate projections indicate an increase not only in heatwaves but also mean temperature and humidity during the warm season, and especially warmer temperatures at night.}

By analyzing 122 recordings from 61 patients in emergency departments, we found a weak relationship between the left and right hand tremor frequencies (correlation coefficient of 0.63). We found a much stronger relationship between the expert physician tremor ratings (on CIWA-Ar 0-7 scale) of the two hands, with a correlation coefficient of 0.923. Next, using a smartphone to collect the tremor data and using a previously developed model for obtaining estimated tremor ratings, we also found a strong correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.852) between the estimates of each hand. Finally, we evaluated different methods of combining the data from the two hands for obtaining a single tremor rating estimate, and found that simply averaging the tremor ratings of the two hands results in the lowest tremor estimate error (an RMSE of 0.977). Looking at the frequency dependence of this error, we found that higher frequency tremors had a much lower estimation error (an RMSE of 1.102 for tremors with frequencies in the 3-6Hz range as compared to 0.625 for tremors with frequencies in the 7-10Hz range).}

 abstract     = {A probability sample of 1494 adult casualty patients sampled in four hospitals in a single Californian county were breathalyzed and interviewed regarding the cause of injury, drinking prior to the injury, quantity and frequency of usual drinking, frequency of drunkenness and prior alcohol-related accidents. In the total sample, 9{\%} were positive on the breathalyzer (4{\%} were at or above 0.10), 17{\%} reported drinking within 6 h prior to the injury, and 29{\%} reported heavy drinking during the last year. Overall, 15{\%} reported a prior alcohol-related accident and this was significantly greater among heavy drinkers than other drinkers. Cause of casualty (fall, cutting/piercing, motor vehicle accident, other collision, fire, other cause) in relation to alcohol consumption variables was analyzed separately in gender- and age-specific categories. Few significant associations were found between drinking variables and individual causes of injury. While these findings may be due to the relatively small number of cases for some causes, as well as to other variables not examined here including severity and type of injury, such baseline exploratory data are important in furthering our understanding of alcohol's involvement in casualty occurrence and point to the need for additional research on alcohol and causes of injury.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Multisensor fitness trackers offer the ability to longitudinally estimate sleep quality in a home environment with the potential to outperform traditional actigraphy. To benefit from these new tools for objectively assessing sleep for clinical and research purposes, multisensor wearable devices require careful validation against the gold standard of sleep polysomnography (PSG). Naturalistic studies favor validation.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to validate the Fitbit Charge 2 against portable home PSG in a shift-work population composed of 59 first responder police officers and paramedics undergoing shift work.METHODS: A reliable comparison between the two measurements was ensured through the data-driven alignment of a PSG and Fitbit time series that was recorded at night. Epoch-by-epoch analyses and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, the Matthews correlation coefficient, bias, and limits of agreement.RESULTS: Sleep onset and offset, total sleep time, and the durations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid-eye movement sleep stages N1+N2 and N3 displayed unbiased estimates with nonnegligible limits of agreement. In contrast, the proprietary Fitbit algorithm overestimated REM sleep latency by 29.4 minutes and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) by 37.1 minutes. Epoch-by-epoch analyses indicated better specificity than sensitivity, with higher accuracies for WASO (0.82) and REM sleep (0.86) than those for N1+N2 (0.55) and N3 (0.78) sleep. Fitbit heart rate (HR) displayed a small underestimation of 0.9 beats per minute (bpm) and a limited capability to capture sudden HR changes because of the lower time resolution compared to that of PSG. The underestimation was smaller in N2, N3, and REM sleep (0.6-0.7 bpm) than in N1 sleep (1.2 bpm) and wakefulness (1.9 bpm), indicating a state-specific bias. Finally, Fitbit suggested a distribution of all sleep episode durations that was different from that derived from PSG and showed nonbiological discontinuities, indicating the potential limitations of the staging algorithm.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that by following careful data processing processes, the Fitbit Charge 2 can provide reasonably accurate mean values of sleep and HR estimates in shift workers under naturalistic conditions. Nevertheless, the generally wide limits of agreement hamper the precision of quantifying individual sleep episodes. The value of this consumer-grade multisensor wearable in terms of tackling clinical and research questions could be enhanced with open-source algorithms, raw data access, and the ability to blind participants to their own sleep data.}

To determine whether the combination of mometasone furoate (MF) and oxymetazoline (OXY) is more effective than either agent alone, we performed a two-stage, parallel, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, clinical trial with 240 AH children with concomitant perennial AR. During the first stage, all children were randomly assigned to the MF or control group for six weeks of treatment. During the second stage, the non-responders from stage one were randomly assigned to 4 groups for 8 weeks of treatment that involved receiving the following treatments: MF/OXY, MF/placebo, placebo/OXY, or placebo/placebo. During the first stage of treatment, 39{\%} of the responders treated with MF achieved greater reductions in total and individual symptom scores than did those on placebo. During the second stage of treatment, the nasal congestion scores of the MF/OXY group significantly decreased. The adenoid/choana ratio of the MF/OXY-treated group decreased and the nasal volume increased significantly. Our results suggest that the combination of OXY and MF is effective and safe for the treatment of AH children with concomitant AR and has a rapid onset of action.}

Estrogen Receptor (ERalpha) is the best-studied and has a seminal role in the clinic both as a prognostic marker but also as a predictor of response to anti-estrogenic therapies. Progesterone Receptor (PR) is also used in the clinic but with a more debatable prognostic role and the role of the four other SNRs, ERbeta, Androgen Receptor (AR), Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) and Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR), is starting only to be appreciated. ERalpha, but also to a certain degree the other SNRs, have been reported to be involved in virtually every cancer-enabling process, both promoting and impeding carcinogenesis. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and the reverse Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition (MET) are such carcinogenesis-enabling processes with important roles in invasion and metastasis initiation but also establishment of tumor in the metastatic site. EMT is governed by several signal transduction pathways culminating in core transcription factors of the process, such as Snail, Slug, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and Twist, among others. This paper will discuss direct regulation of these core transcription factors by SNRs in breast cancer. Interrogation of publicly available databases for binding sites of SNRs on promoters of core EMT factors will also be included in an attempt to fill gaps where other experimental data are not available.}

Correctional humanities correctional education in prison is operated as a program that was created with the intention of reducing correctional correction and crime recidivism rate, but the related research is insignificant and the exploratory research is carried out. The reality is that the correctional humanities program is mixed with personality education. In the critical perspective that has been removed from the previous studies, it was confirmed that the human rights education for prisoners, which should be treated most importantly in state-owned and private prisons, which are detention facilities, is overlooked. The results of the study are summarized as follows: First, the private prisons were judged to be superior in quality and quantity in general compared to the correctional humanities program conducted by state and private prisons for prisoners. The basis of this study is to establish clear goals of the program, to provide specific step-by-step educational methods, and to operate selective program participation of prisoners according to the characteristics of religious prisons. Second, the simple comparison of the re-commissioning rate of state-run and private prisons showed that the re-commissioning rate of state-run prisons was about 7.2{\%} higher than that of private prisons. Considering the phenomenon of the cause of the reduction of the re-commissioning rate of the prisoners released from the private prison and the zero rate of correctional accidents, it is suggested that there should be follow-up studies related to them. Third, to establish the concept of the correctional humanities, the definition of the  correctional humanities, which combines the education of humanities, personality, and human rights, was formed as a operational definition. Fourth, the name of the basic education should be improved to the general education and the name of the selective education rather than the re-education being reviewed in order to meet the spirit of the times. The government's trust comes from the fingertips of law enforcement officers, which is a beautiful law enforcement field for correctional humanities, and can be found as a task of improving governance. Now, the paradigm of correctional education should be directed toward the direction of human rights centered on correctional humanities toward correctional welfare.}

Ninety-one patients transported by ambulance to a university emergency department (ED) directly from the scene of an MVC from August 1997 to April 1998 were enrolled. Potential patients were identified from the ED log and consent was obtained to investigate the crash vehicle. Data describing MVC characteristics were abstracted from the PR, AR, and medical record. Variables of interest included restraint use (RU), air bag deployment (AD), and type of impact (TI). Agreements between the variables and the independent crash investigation were compared using kappa. Interrater reliability was determined using kappa by comparing a random sample of 20 abstracted reports for each data source with the originally abstracted data.RESULTS: Agreement using kappa between the crash investigation and each data source was 0.588 (95{\%} CI = 0.508 to 0.667) for the PR, 0.330 (95{\%} CI = 0.252 to 0.407) for the AR, and 0.492 (95{\%} CI = 0.413 to 0.572) for the EDR. Variable agreement was 0.239 (95{\%} CI = 0.164 to 0.314) for RU, 0.350 (95{\%} CI = 0.268 to 0.432) for AD, and 0.631 (95{\%} = 0.563 to 0.698) for TI. Interrater reliability was excellent (kappa > 0.8) for all data sources.CONCLUSIONS: The strength of the agreement between the independent crash investigation and the data sources that were measured by kappa was fair to moderate, indicating inaccuracies. This presents ramifications for researchers and necessitates consideration of the validity and accuracy of crash characteristics contained in these data sources.}

 abstract     = {Owing to the complexity of interacting molecular networks on the cell surface, integrin-associated tetraspanin CD151 remains controversial regarding its clinical importance and functional impact in prostate cancer. The current study evaluated dynamics and clinical importance of CD151 expression and its function in prostate cancer by IHC analysis of two independent patient cohorts (n=80, 181), bioinformatic interrogation of the TCGA database, and evaluation of gene knockdown effect at the cellular level. Our data showed that aside from high mRNA expression, CD151 was primarily localized to intercellular junctions at the plasma membrane in normal prostate glands or benign tissues, regardless of nature of antibodies used. By contrast, in primary tumors from patients with metastatic disease, CD151 was largely localized in the cytosol. Furthermore, the level of the cell-cell junction-linked CD151 was inversely associated with Gleason grade and tumor stage (P<0.001 for both). The portion of primary tumors expressing junctional CD151 was also three-fold less in the metastatic patient population than its counterpart (P<0.001). In line with these observations, CD151 and its associated alpha3beta1 or alpha6beta4 integrin inversely correlated with androgen receptor (AR) at the mRNA level (Spearman coefficient: -0.44, -0.48 and -0.42) in the TCGA cohort. Expression of these adhesion molecules also correlated with DNA methylation in their promoters (Spearman coefficient: -0.37, -0.71 and -0.82). Combined, these data suggest that CD151 and associated integrins are linked to tumor metastasis through AR and the epigenetic program. Meanwhile, CD151 knockdown in E-cadherin-positive tumor cells led to increased cell proliferation and induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype. Given the strong RGD-binding integrin dependence of EMT-featured tumor cells, we examined focal adhesion kinase (FAK), their key signaling effector, in the above patient cohorts. In contrast to CD151, FAK exhibited positive correlation with tumor grade and stage as well as AR and p53 inactivation at either mRNA, protein or genomic level. Taken together, our results suggest that CD151 represses prostate cancer by antagonizing cell proliferation, EMT and the signaling of RGD-binding integrins. Since this anti-tumorigenic role is prone to the AR-mediated transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, CD151 and possibly alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrins are of potential biomarkers for metastatic prostate cancer.}

However, the pathogenesis of PNI remains unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the correlation between sympathetic innervation and SACC PNI and to elucidate how the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) regulates the PNI process.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sympathetic innervation and beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) expression in SACC tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The NE concentrations in SACC tissues and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) coculture models were measured by ELISA. beta2-AR expression in SACC cells was detected by performing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assay. SACC cells were treated with NE, the nonselective alpha-AR blocker phentolamine, the beta2-AR antagonist ICI118,551, or were transfected with beta2-AR small interfering RNA (siRNA). Proliferation was evaluated in methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, and migration was evaluated in Transwell assay and wound-healing assay. PNI was tested through both Transwell assay and a DRG coculture model. The expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were measured by performing qRT-PCR and Western blot assay.RESULTS: Sympathetic innervation and beta2-AR were highly distributed in SACC tissues and correlated positively with PNI (P=0.035 and P=0.003, respectively). The sympathetic neurotransmitter NE was overexpressed in SACC tissues and DRG coculture models. Exogenously added NE promoted proliferation, migration, and PNI of SACC cells via beta2-AR activation. NE/beta2-AR signaling may promote proliferation, migration, and PNI by inducing EMT and upregulating MMPs. However, beta2-AR inhibition with either an antagonist or siRNA abrogated NE-induced PNI.CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings reveal the supportive role of sympathetic innervation in the pathogenesis of SACC PNI and suggest beta2-AR as a potential therapeutic target for treating PNI in SACC.}

To curb this trend and respond to the need for high-quality care, St. Edward Mercy Medical Center, Fort Smith, AR, instituted the nurse specialist program, in which nurses can develop competency in multiple clinical areas with accompanying financial incentives. In developing the program, which provides a cadre of nurses to augment the regular staff wherever needed, job descriptions and the requirements for selection, recruitment, and training were developed, as was some method to evaluate the program. Requirements for participation included at least one year of hands-on experience at the medical center, good clinical skills, and adherence to the Mercy philosophy of care. Those selected were trained in five specialized clinical areas: intensive care, labor and delivery, emergency services, post-anesthesia recovery, and nursery. The program at first met resistance from other nurses and abuse from nursing supervisors. But this has been replaced by acceptance and appreciation. The nurse specialists are seen as an elite group, meeting patient and staff needs as extra pairs of caring and competent hands, with the potential to calm a stressful clinical environment.}

 abstract     = {Multiple mechanisms contribute to the survival and growth of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cells without androgen, including androgen receptor splice variants (AR-V) and de novo intratumoral androgen synthesis. AKR1C3 is a critical androgenic enzyme that plays different roles in mCRPC, such as an EMT driver or AR coactivator. However, the relationship and regulatory mechanisms between AKR1C3 and AR-V remain largely unknown. In this study, we observed a positive correlation between AKR1C3 and AR-V7 staining in tissues from prostate rebiopsy at mCRPC. Mechanistically, AKR1C3 interacts with AR-V7 protein in CRPC cells, which can reciprocally inhibit AR-V7 and AKR1C3 protein degradation. Biologically, this complex is essential for in vitro and in vivo tumour growth of CRPC cells after androgen deprivation as it represses B4GALT1, a unique tumour suppressor gene in PCa. Together, this study reveals AKR1C3/AR-V7 complex as a potential therapeutic target in mCRPC.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Use of ketamine in the prehospital setting may be advantageous due to its potent analgesic and sedative properties and favorable risk profile. Use in the military setting has demonstrated both efficacy and safety for pain relief. The purpose of this study was to assess ketamine training, use, and perceptions in the civilian setting among nationally certified paramedics (NRPs) in the United States.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of NRPs was performed. The electronic questionnaire assessed paramedic training, authorization, use, and perceptions of ketamine. Included in the analysis were completed surveys of paramedics who held one or more state paramedic credentials, indicated "patient care provider" as their primary role, and worked in non-military settings. Descriptive statistics were calculated.RESULTS: A total of 14,739 responses were obtained (response rate=23{\%}), of which 10,737 (73{\%}) met inclusion criteria and constituted the study cohort. Over one-half (53{\%}) of paramedics reported learning about ketamine during their initial paramedic training. Meanwhile, 42{\%} reported seeking ketamine-related education on their own. Of all respondents, only 33{\%} (3,421/10,737) were authorized by protocol to use ketamine. Most commonly authorized uses included pain management (55{\%}), rapid sequence intubation (RSI; 72{\%}), and chemical restraint/sedation (72{\%}). One-third of authorized providers (1,107/3,350) had never administered ketamine, with another 32{\%} (1,070/3,350) having administered ketamine less than five times in their career. Ketamine was perceived to be safe and effective as the vast majority reported that they were comfortable with the use of ketamine (94{\%}) and would, in similar situations (95{\%}), use it again.CONCLUSION: This was the first large, national survey to assess ketamine training, use, and perceptions among paramedics in the civilian prehospital setting. While training related to ketamine use was commonly reported among paramedics, few were authorized to administer the drug by their agency's protocols. Of those authorized to use ketamine, most paramedics had limited experience administering the drug. Future research is needed to determine why the prevalence of ketamine use is low and to assess the safety and efficacy of ketamine use in the prehospital setting.

This study assessed tumor cells from patients with prostate cancer participating in a phase II neoadjuvant docetaxel and androgen deprivation trial to identify mediators of resistance. Transcriptional level of 93 genes from a docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines microarray study was analyzed by TaqMan low-density arrays in tumors from patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer (36 surgically treated, 28 with neoadjuvant docetaxel + androgen deprivation). Gene expression was compared between groups and correlated with clinical outcome. VIM, AR and RELA were validated by immunohistochemistry. CD44 and ZEB1 expression was tested by immunofluorescence in cells and tumor samples. Parental and docetaxel-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines were tested for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers before and after docetaxel exposure. Reversion of EMT phenotype was investigated as a docetaxel resistance reversion strategy. Expression of 63 (67.7{\%}) genes differed between groups (P < 0.05), including genes related to androgen receptor, NF-kappaB transcription factor, and EMT. Increased expression of EMT markers correlated with radiologic relapse. Docetaxel-resistant cells had increased EMT and stem-like cell markers expression. ZEB1 siRNA transfection reverted docetaxel resistance and reduced CD44 expression in DU-145R and PC-3R. Before docetaxel exposure, a selected CD44(+) subpopulation of PC-3 cells exhibited EMT phenotype and intrinsic docetaxel resistance; ZEB1/CD44(+) subpopulations were found in tumor cell lines and primary tumors; this correlated with aggressive clinical behavior. This study identifies genes potentially related to chemotherapy resistance and supports evidence of the EMT role in docetaxel resistance and adverse clinical behavior in early prostate cancer.}

This study reports on efforts by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration, Office of Emergency Management's (OEM) Comprehensive Emergency Management Program (CEMP) to assess the readiness of VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) across the nation. Hypothesis/Problem This study conducts descriptive analyses of preparedness assessments of VAMCs and examines change in hospital readiness over time.METHODS: To assess change, quantitative analyses of data from two phases of preparedness assessments (Phase I: 2008-2010; Phase II: 2011-2013) at 137 VAMCs were conducted using 61 unique capabilities assessed during the two phases. The initial five-point Likert-like scale used to rate each capability was collapsed into a dichotomous variable: "not-developed=0" versus "developed=1." To describe changes in preparedness over time, four new categories were created from the Phase I and Phase II dichotomous variables: (1) rated developed in both phases; (2) rated not-developed in Phase I but rated developed in Phase II; (3) rated not-developed in both phases; and (4) rated developed in Phase I but rated not- developed in Phase II.RESULTS: From a total of 61 unique emergency preparedness capabilities, 33 items achieved the desired outcome - they were rated either "developed in both phases" or "became developed" in Phase II for at least 80{\%} of VAMCs. For 14 items, 70{\%}-80{\%} of VAMCs achieved the desired outcome. The remaining 14 items were identified as "low-performing" capabilities, defined as less than 70{\%} of VAMCs achieved the desired outcome.CONCLUSION: Measuring emergency management capabilities is a necessary first step to improving those capabilities. Furthermore, assessing hospital readiness over time and creating robust hospital readiness assessment tools can help hospitals make informed decisions regarding allocation of resources to ensure patient safety, provide timely access to high-quality patient care, and identify best practices in emergency management during and after disasters. Moreover, with some minor modifications, this comprehensive, all-hazards-based, hospital preparedness assessment tool could be adapted for use beyond the VA.

To systematically identify microRNAs (miRs) modulating AR activity in lethal disease, hormone-responsive and -resistant PC cells expressing a luciferase-based AR reporter were transfected with a miR inhibitor library; 78 inhibitors significantly altered AR activity. Upon validation, miR-346, miR-361-3p and miR-197 inhibitors markedly reduced AR transcriptional activity, mRNA and protein levels, increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation, repressed EMT, and inhibited PC migration and invasion, demonstrating additive effects with AR inhibition. Corresponding miRs increased AR activity through a novel and anti-dogmatic mechanism of direct association with AR 6.9kb 3'UTR and transcript stabilisation. In addition, miR-346 and miR-361-3p modulation altered levels of constitutively active AR variants, and inhibited variant-driven PC cell proliferation, so may contribute to persistent AR signalling in CRPC in the absence of circulating androgens. Pathway analysis of AGO-PAR-CLIP-identified miR targets revealed roles in DNA replication and repair, cell cycle, signal transduction and immune function. Silencing these targets, including tumour suppressors ARHGDIA and TAGLN2, phenocopied miR effects, demonstrating physiological relevance. MiR-346 additionally upregulated the oncogene, YWHAZ, which correlated with grade, biochemical relapse and metastasis in patients. These AR-modulatory miRs and targets correlated with AR activity in patient biopsies, and were elevated in response to long-term enzalutamide treatment of patient-derived CRPC xenografts. In summary, we identified miRs that modulate AR activity in PC and CRPC, via novel mechanisms, and may represent novel PC therapeutic targets.}

In the present study Cadmium (Cd)-induced AR was evaluated to ameliorate the genotoxicity of a known chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) based on cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative stress in two model plant systems Allium cepa L. and Vicia faba L. Priming the plants with cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 25 and 50muM) reduced the genotoxicity of EMS (0.25mM). Cd-induced AR was evident by the magnitude of adaptive response (MAR) values calculated for cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and biochemical parameters. In addition the involvement of some major metabolic pathways and epigenetic modifications in AR was investigated. Metabolic blockers of protein kinase cascades, DNA repair, oxidative stress and de novo translation interfered with the adaptive response implying their role in AR whereas, inhibitors involved in post-replication repair and autophagy were ineffective implicating that they probably have no role in the AR studied. Moreover to find the role of DNA methylation in AR, methylation-sensitive comet assay was carried out. Simultaneously 5-methyl- 2'-deoxycytidine (5mdC) levels were quantified by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). AR was eliminated in cells treated with a demethylating agent, 5-aza- 2'deoxycytidine (AZA). Results implied a contribution of DNA hypermethylation. To the best of our knowledge this is a first report correlating DNA methylation to Cd-induced adaptive response in plants undergoing genotoxic stress.}

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical specimens obtained from seven pretreated DSRCT patients were interrogated using GEP complemented by immunohistochemistry, a cancer stem cell array, and miRNA in situ hybridisation, including the combined chimera modules miRNA-200/ZEB1 and miRNA-34/SLUG. The chimera modules divided the cases into three classes that respectively recapitulated the traits of mesenchymal epithelial reverse transition (MErT), epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and hybrid/partial EMT. This indicates a close correlation between the reprogramming governed by EMT regulators and DSRCT biology, which was further confirmed by miRNA-21 and is consistent with the broad morphological spectrum of DSRCTs. Starting from the miRNA-200/ZEB1 axis, we also found that DSRCTs carry a signature of immunological ignorance that is not responsive to PD--L1 blockade. Evidence that the up-regulation of miRNA-200 and E-cadherin, and quite a high level of miRNA-21 expression segregate with the MErT supports the idea that, in addition to the hybrid/partial state, MErT is also enriched in stemness: the androgen-positive cases, whose stemness traits were confirmed by stem cell arrays, all fell into these two classes. Our findings also confirmed that tumoral cell PDGFRA expression correlates with desmoplasia, and demonstrated the co-expression of PDGFRA and ISLR/Meflin, another marker of pluripotency. Despite the limited number of cases, these findings provide unexpectedly relevant information concerning the pathogenesis of DSRCTs, and prove the validity of miRNA-based chimera circuit modelling in the clinico-pathological setting.}

This study aimed to pilot a remote digital postoperative wound monitoring service and evaluate the readiness for implementation in routine clinical practice. This was a single-arm pilot implementational study of remote digital postoperative wound monitoring across two tertiary care hospitals in the UK (IDEAL stage 2b, clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05069103). Adults undergoing abdominal surgery were recruited and received a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool for 30-days postoperatively. Patients received 30-day postoperative follow-up, including the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). A thematic mixed-methods approach was used, according to the WHO framework for monitoring and evaluating digital health interventions. 200 patients were enroled, of whom 115 (57.5{\%}) underwent emergency surgical procedures. Overall, the 30-day SSI rate was 16.5{\%} (n=33/200), with 72.7{\%} (n=24) diagnosed post-discharge. Usage of the intervention was 83.0{\%} (n=166/200), with subsequently 74.1{\%} (n=123/166) TUQ completion. There were no issues reported with feasibility of the technology, with the reliability (3.87, 95{\%} CI: 3.73-4.00) and quality of the interface rated highly (4.18, 95{\%}: 4.06-4.30). Patient acceptance was similarly high with regards to ease of use (4.51, 95{\%} CI: 4.41-4.62), satisfaction (4.27, 95{\%} CI: 4.13-4.41), and usefulness (4.07, 95{\%} CI: 3.92-4.23). Despite the desire for more frequent and personalised interactions, the majority viewed the intervention as providing meaningful benefit over routine postoperative care. Remote digital postoperative wound monitoring successfully demonstrated readiness for implementation with regards to the technology, usability, and healthcare process improvement.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fall detection is an important problem for vulnerable sectors of the population such as elderly people, who frequently live alone. Note that a fall can be very dangerous for them if they cannot ask for help. Hence, in those situations, an automatic system that detected and informed to emergency services about the fall and subject identity could help to save lives. This way, they would know not only when but also who to help. Thus, our objective is to develop a new approach, based on deep learning, for fall detection and people identification that can be used in different datasets without any fine-tuning of the model parameters.METHODS: We present a dataset-independent deep learning-based model that, by employing a multi-task learning approach, uses raw inertial information as input to solve simultaneously two tasks: fall detection and subject identification. By this way, our approach is able to automatically learn the best representations without any constraint introduced by the pre-processed features.RESULTS: Our cross-dataset classifier is able to detect falls with more than a 98{\%} of accuracy in four datasets recorded under different conditions (i.e. accelerometer device, sampling rate, sequence length, age of the subjects, etc.). Moreover, the number of false positives is very low - on average less than 1.6{\%} - establishing a new state-of-the-art. Finally, our classifier is also capable of correctly identifying people with an average accuracy of 79.6{\%}.CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach performs both tasks (fall detection and people identification) by using a single model and achieving real-time execution. The obtained results allow us to assert that a single model can be used for both fall detection and people identification under different conditions, easing its real implementation, as it is not necessary to train the model for new subjects.}

 abstract     = {Introduction: Limited geographical access to quality Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) is a major driver of high maternal mortality. Geographic access to EmONC facilities is identified by the global community as a critical issue for reducing maternal mortality and is proposed as a global indicator by the Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality (EPMM) initiative. Geographic accessibility models can provide insight into the population that lacks adequate access and on the optimal distribution of facilities and resources. Travel scenarios (i.e., modes and speed of transport) used to compute geographical access to healthcare are a key input to these models and should approximate reality as much as possible. This study explores strategies to optimize and harmonize knowledge elicitation practices for developing travel scenarios.Methods: Knowledge elicitation practices for travel scenario workshops (TSW) were studied in 14 African and South-Asian countries where the United Nations Population Fund supported ministries of health and governments in strengthening networks of EmONC facilities. This was done through a mixed methods evaluation study following a transdisciplinary approach, applying the four phases of the Interactive Learning and Action methodology: exploration, in-depth, integration, and prioritization and action planning. Data was collected in November 2020-June 2021 and involved scoping activities, stakeholder identification, semi-structured interviews (N = 9), an evaluation survey (N = 31), and two co-creating focus group discussions (N = 8).Results: Estimating realistic travel speeds and limited time for the workshop were considered as the largest barriers. The identified opportunities were inclusively prioritized, whereby preparation; a favorable composition of attendees; validation practices; and evaluation were anticipated to be the most promising improvement strategies, explaining their central place on the co-developed initial standard operating procedure (SOP) for future TSWs. Mostly extensive preparation-both on the side of the organization and the attendees-was anticipated to address nearly all of the identified TSW challenges.Conclusion: This study showed that the different identified stakeholders had contradicting, complementing and overlapping ideas about strategies to optimize and harmonize TSWs. Yet, an initial SOP was inclusively developed, emphasizing practices for before, during and after each TSW. This SOP is not only relevant in the context of the UNFPA EmONC development approach, but also for monitoring the newly launched EPMM indicator and even in the broader field of geographic accessibility modeling.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a crucial parameter in the management of patients with dyspnea in the emergency department (ED). The use of techniques other than echocardiography such as nuclear or magnetic resonance imaging to measure LVEF is unsuitable in the ED because of time constraints. This study aimed to compare echocardiographic aortic root (AR) excursion and LVEF measurement using the modified Simpson's method (biplane method of disks) as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography.METHODS: After 2 hours of theoretical video and hands-on training with 20 patients by an experienced echocardiographer, two emergency physicians prospectively evaluated patients with dyspnea. Two-dimensional echocardiograms of the parasternal long-axis view were obtained, and the displacement of the aortic root (DAR) was studied. M-mode DAR recordings were obtained, and distances were measured as the maximized anterior displacement of the AR from the horizontal axis at end-systole by using the leading-edge methodology. LVEF was measured by an experienced cardiologist using the modified Simpson's rule. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were analyzed. A new formula for the prediction of the ejection fraction (EF) with the aid of DAR was then created.RESULTS: The mean ({\textpm}SD) age with of the 70 study patients was 69.7 ({\textpm}11.91) years. In these patients, DAR was highly correlated with EF (point biserial correlation coefficient = 0.79, p < 0.001) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) results were significant (F = 115.9; p < 0.001). The sensitivity was 94.4; specificity, 94.1; LR+, 16.6; LR-, 0.059; PPV, 94.4; and NPV, 94.1.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that DAR is a sensitive index of left ventricular systolic function (SF) and can be used to reliably predict EF values using the rough formula of EF = 20 + 44 (DAR).}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies highlighted the increased frequency of AR-low or -negative prostate cancers (PCas) and the importance of AR-independent mechanisms in driving metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) development and progression. Several previous studies have highlighted the involvement of the MEN1 gene in PCa. In the current study, we focused on its role specifically in AR-independent PCa cells.METHODS: Cell tumorigenic features were evaluated by proliferation assay, foci formation, colony formation in soft agar, wound healing assay and xenograft experiments in mice. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining were performed to determine the expression of different factors in human PCa lines. Different ChIP-qPCR-based assays were carried out to dissect the action of JunD and beta-catenin.RESULTS: We found that MEN1 silencing in AR-independent cell lines, DU145 and PC3, resulted in an increase in anchorage independence and cell migration, accompanied by sustained MYC expression. By searching for factors known to positively regulate MYC expression and play a relevant role in PCa development and progression, we uncovered that MEN1-KD triggered the nuclear translocation of JunD and beta-catenin. ChIP and 3C analyses further demonstrated that MEN1-KD led to, on the one hand, augmented binding of JunD to the MYC 5' enhancer and increased formation of loop structure, and on the other hand, increased binding of beta-catenin to the MYC promoter. Moreover, the expression of several molecular markers of EMT, including E-cadherin, BMI1, Twist1 and HIF-1alpha, was altered in MEN1-KD DU145 and PC3 cells. In addition, analyses using cultured cells and PC3-GFP xenografts in mice demonstrated that JunD and beta-catenin are necessary for the altered tumorigenic potential triggered by MEN1 inactivation in AR-independent PCa cells. Finally, we observed a significant negative clinical correlation between MEN1 and CTNNB1 mRNA expression in primary PCa and mCRPC datasets.CONCLUSIONS: Our current work highlights an unrecognized oncosuppressive role for menin specifically in AR-independent PCa cells, through the activation of JunD and beta-catenin pathways.}

We performed a preimplementation comparative system evaluation to measure time on task, number of screens, information retrieval accuracy, cognitive load, user satisfaction, and perceived utility and usefulness. Application usage and system functionality were assessed using application logs and a postimplementation survey of end users.RESULTS: Usability testing of the Asthma Timeline Application demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in time on task (P<.001), number of screens (P<.001), and cognitive load (P<.001) for clinicians when compared to base EHR functionality. Postimplementation evaluation demonstrated reliable functionality and high user satisfaction.DISCUSSION: Following HCD processes to develop an application in the context of clinical operations/quality improvement is feasible. Our work also highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated with using internationally recognized data exchange standards as currently implemented.CONCLUSION: Compared to standard EHR functionality, our visualization increased clinician efficiency when reviewing the charts of pediatric asthma patients. Application development efforts in an operational context should leverage existing health information exchange standards, such as FHIR, and evidence-based mixed methods approaches.}

 abstract     = {Prostate (CaP) cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men in Western societies. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a critical survival pathway for prostate cancer cells, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the principal treatment for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease. Although a majority of patients initially respond to ADT, most will eventually develop castrate resistance. The recent discovery that AR signaling persists during systemic castration via intratumoral production of androgens led to the development of novel anti-androgen therapies. Although these therapies effectively palliate symptoms and prolong life, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains incurable. Recent studies suggest that epithelial plasticity, which covers a range of changes in differentiation and cell behavior, with full epithelial integrity at one end and epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) as the full realization of a plasticity is regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs are involved in human tumourigenesis and are aberrantly expressed in CaP cell lines, xenografts and clinical tissues and is associated with enhanced survival signaling, proliferation, migration, invasion, integrin-mediated adhesion, EMT, and drug resistance. Due to the oncogenic or tumor suppressive properties of CaP-related miRNAs, they are likely to be of clinical use as therapeutic targets for prostate cancer treatment in the near future. This review summarizes our current understanding of CaP and castration-recurrent CaP (CR-CaP) to earlier studies that characterized ADT and the molecular mechanisms that facilitate the transition from androgen-stimulated CaP to CR-CaP.}

In this prospective study, we evaluated the prognostic role of CTC gene expression on cabazitaxel-treated patients and its association with plasma androgen receptor (AR) copy number (CN).METHODS: Patients receiving cabazitaxel 20 or 25mg/sqm for mCRPC were enrolled. Digital PCR was performed to assess plasma AR CN status. CTC enrichment was assessed using the AdnaTest EMT-2/StemCell kit. CTC expression analyses were performed for 17 genes. Data are expressed as hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) and 95{\%} CI.RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were fully evaluable. CTC expression of AR-V7 (HR=2.52, 1.24-5.12, p=0.011), AKR1C3 (HR=2.01, 1.06-3.81, p=0.031), AR (HR=2.70, 1.46-5.01, p=0.002), EPCAM (HR=3.75, 2.10-6.71, p<0.0001), PSMA (HR=2.09, 1.19-3.66, p=0.01), MDK (HR=3.35, 1.83-6.13, p<0.0001), and HPRT1 (HR=2.46, 1.44-4.18, p=0.0009) was significantly associated with OS. ALDH1 (OR=5.50, 0.97-31.22, p=0.05), AR (OR=8.71, 2.32-32.25, p=0.001), EPCAM (OR=7.26, 1.47-35.73, p=0.015), PSMA (OR=3.86, 1.10-13.50, p=0.035), MDK (OR=6.84, 1.87-24.98, p=0.004), and HPRT1 (OR=7.41, 1.82-30.19, p=0.005) expression was associated with early PD. AR CN status was significantly correlated with AR-V7 (p=0.05), EPCAM (p=0.02), and MDK (p=0.002) expression. In multivariable model, EPCAM and HPRT1 CTC expression, plasma AR CN gain, ECOG PS=2, and liver metastases and PSA were independently associated with poorer OS. In patients treated with cabazitaxel 20mg/sqm, median OS was shorter in AR-V7 positive than negative patients (6.6 versus 14months, HR=3.46, 1.47-8.17], p=0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Baseline CTC biomarkers may be prognosticators for cabazitaxel-treated mCRPC patients. Cabazitaxel at lower (20mg/sqm) dose was associated with poorer outcomes in AR-V7 positive patients compared to AR-V7 negative patients in a post hoc subgroup analysis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03381326 .

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Early detection of patient deterioration is a key element of patient safety as it allows timely clinical intervention and potential rescue, thus reducing the risks of serious patient safety incidents. Longitudinal patient monitoring systems have been widely recommended for use to detect clinical deterioration. However, there is conflicting evidence on whether they improve patient outcomes. This may in part be related to variation in the rigour with which they are implemented and evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a longitudinal patient monitoring system designed for adult patients in the unique environment of the Emergency Department (ED).METHODS: A novel participatory action research (PAR) approach is taken where socio-technical systems (STS) theory and analysis informs the implementation through the improvement methodology of 'Plan Do Study Act' (PDSA) cycles. We hypothesise that conducting an STS analysis of the ED before beginning the PDSA cycles will provide for a much richer understanding of the current situation and possible challenges to implementing the ED-specific longitudinal patient monitoring system. This methodology will enable both a process and an outcome evaluation of implementing the ED-specific longitudinal patient monitoring system. Process evaluations can help distinguish between interventions that have inherent faults and those that are badly executed.DISCUSSION: Over 1.2 million patients attend EDs annually in Ireland; the successful implementation of an ED-specific longitudinal patient monitoring system has the potential to affect the care of a significant number of such patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study combining PAR, STS and multiple PDSA cycles to evaluate the implementation of an ED-specific longitudinal patient monitoring system and to determine (through process and outcome evaluation) whether this system can significantly improve patient outcomes by early detection and appropriate intervention for patients at risk of clinical deterioration.}

MeSH headings used in the search include: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, atomoxetine, stimulants, psychostimulants, methylphenidate, and amphetamine salts. Relevant data presented at professional meetings that we attended were also identified.STUDY SELECTION AND EXTRACTION: All clinical studies comparing atomoxetine with psychostimulants, regardless of study design, were evaluated. Relevant efficacy and safety data from these studies were included in the discussion.DATA SYNTHESIS: At time of writing, 5 head-to-head trials had compared psychostimulants and atomoxetine in the treatment of ADHD. No significant difference between atomoxetine and methylphenidate immediate-release were found on the ADHD Rating Scale total score. Osmotic oral release system (OROS) methylphenidate showed significantly greater improvement at weeks 1 and 2, and significantly more patients treated with OROS methylphenidate were classified as responders. Patients on both atomoxetine and mixed amphetamine salts extended-release (MAS XR) showed significant improvements at endpoint over baseline; however, Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) scores were significantly better with MAS XR. Tolerability was similar between atomoxetine and stimulant medications.CONCLUSIONS: Based on available evidence, psychostimulants are regarded as first-line pharmacologic treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD, as the efficacy and safety of these agents have been well established based on clinical trials and extensive naturalistic use. Adverse effects in some patients and abuse potential have led to the search for new treatments. Atomoxetine represents an alternative treatment for ADHD and is unlikely to be associated with abuse; however, long-term safety data are needed to further establish its place in therapy.}

Mean aggregate scores for each antibody per variant was analyzed using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test when appropriate. Agreement between AR and SR regions was correlated using Spearman's correlation co-efficient.RESULTS: A higher staining SLUG intensity in the stellate reticulum (SR) like areas relative to the ameloblast like areas (AR) was observed, without concomitant E-cadherin repression or elimination. However, a direct relationship between SLUG and N-cadherin was observed.CONCLUSION: Expression of SLUG in the SR like areas can be utilized to predict the biologic behavior of specific clinico-histological variants, however its mechanism via alterations in cadherin switching is equivocal.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Medical data from family doctors are of great importance to health care researchers but seem to be locked in German practices and, thus, are underused in research. The RADAR project (Routine Anonymized Data for Advanced Health Services Research) aims at designing, implementing and piloting a generic research architecture, technical software solutions as well as procedures and workflows to unlock data from family doctor's practices. A long-term medical data repository for research taking legal requirements into account is established. Thereby, RADAR helps closing the gap between the European countries and to contribute data from primary care in Germany.METHODS: The RADAR project comprises three phases: (1) analysis phase, (2) design phase, and (3) pilot. First, interdisciplinary workshops were held to list prerequisites and requirements. Second, an architecture diagram with building blocks and functions, and an ordered list of process steps (workflow) for data capture and storage were designed. Third, technical components and workflows were piloted. The pilot was extended by a data integration workflow using patient-reported outcomes (paper-based questionnaires).RESULTS: The analysis phase resulted in listing 17 essential prerequisites and guiding requirements for data management compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Based on this list existing approaches to fulfil the RADAR tasks were evaluated-for example, re-using BDT interface for data exchange and Trusted Third Party-approach for consent management and record linkage. Consented data sets of 100 patients were successfully exported, separated into person-identifying and medical data, pseudonymised and saved. Record linkage and data integration workflows for patient-reported outcomes in the RADAR research database were successfully piloted for 63 responders.CONCLUSION: The RADAR project successfully developed a generic architecture together with a technical framework of tools, interfaces, and workflows for a complete infrastructure for practicable and secure processing of patient data from family doctors. All technical components and workflows can be reused for further research projects. Additionally, a Trusted Third Party-approach can be used as core element to implement data privacy protection in such heterogeneous family doctor's settings. Optimisations identified comprise a fully-electronic consent recording using tablet computers, which is part of the project's extension phase.}

 abstract     = {Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a polyglutamine-mediated lower motor neuron disease characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. The cause of this disease is the expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat, which encodes the polyglutamine tract, within the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA exclusively occurs in adult males, whereas both heterozygous and homozygous females are usually asymptomatic. Testosterone-dependent nuclear accumulation of the pathogenic AR protein has been considered to be a fundamental step of neurodegenerative process, which is followed by several molecular events such as transcriptional dysregulation, axonal transport disruption, and mitochondria dysfunction. Androgen deprivation suppresses the toxicity of the mutant AR in animal models of SBMA, and these insights have been translated to clinic. Animal studies have also suggested that activation of protein quality control systems are potential therapies for SBMA. To optimize "proof of concept", the process for testing candidate therapies in humans, it is of importance to identify responders to each therapy, to initiate interventions in early stages of the disease, and to establish biomarkers which can be used for evaluating the efficacy of treatment.}

 abstract     = {Increased CCL2 expression in prostate cancer (PCa) cells enhanced metastasis via macrophage recruitment. However, its linkage to androgen receptor (AR)-mediated PCa progression remains unclear. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized regulation: targeting AR with siRNA in PCa cells increased macrophage recruitment via CCL2 up-regulation, which might then result in enhancing PCa invasiveness. Molecular mechanism dissection revealed that targeting PCa AR with siRNA promoted PCa cell migration/invasion via CCL2-dependent STAT3 activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways. Importantly, pharmacologic interruption of the CCL2/CCR2-STAT3 axis suppressed EMT and PCa cell migration, providing a new mechanism linking CCL2 and EMT. Simultaneously targeting PCa AR with siRNA and the CCL2/CCR2-STAT3 axis resulted in better suppression of PCa growth and metastasis in a xenograft PCa mouse model. Human PCa tissue microarray analysis suggests that increased CCL2 expression may be potentially associated with poor prognosis of PCa patients. Together, these results may provide a novel therapeutic approach to better battle PCa progression and metastasis at the castration resistant stage via the combination of targeting AR with siRNA and anti-CCL2/CCR2-STAT3 signalling.}

Guided by the Kirkpatrick framework, we conducted a multimethod evaluation of the training with multiprofessional maternity teams. Participants rated post-training statements about relevance and helpfulness of the training and pre-training and post-training confidence in their knowledge and skills relating to IFH (7-point Likert scales, strongly disagree to strongly agree). An ethnographer recorded sociotechnical observations during the training. Participants provided feedback in post-training focus groups.RESULTS: Participants (N=57) included 21 midwives, 25 obstetricians, 7 anaesthetists and 4 other professionals from five maternity units. Over 95{\%} of participants agreed that the training was relevant and helpful for their clinical practice and improving outcomes following IFH. Confidence in technical and non-technical skills relating to managing IFH was variable before the training (5{\%}-92{\%}agreement with the pre-training statements), but improved in nearly all participants after the training (71{\%}-100{\%}agreement with the post-training statements). Participants and ethnographers reported that the training helped to: (i) better understand the complexity of IFH, (ii) recognise the need for multiprofessional training and management and (iii) optimise communication with those in labour and their birth partners.CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated training package can improve self-reported knowledge, skills and confidence of multiprofessional teams involved in management of IFH at caesarean birth. A larger-scale evaluation is required to validate these findings and establish how best to scale and implement the training.}

 abstract     = {Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) are one of the main causes of air pollution and are associated with lung disorders. DEP exposure may promote several pathological processes, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammation and oxidative stress, which contribute to a decline in lung function. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) has been reported to alleviate lung dysfunction. The impact of DEP on cAMP signaling is largely unknown. Human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells were exposed to different concentrations (≤ 300 g/ml) for up to 72 h. Markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, EMT, components of mitochondrial bioenergetics and cAMP signaling were evaluated. DEP increased gene expression of Nrf1, thioredoxin, HO-1 and SOD-2 (oxidative stress markers), and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 (inflammatory markers), as well as the EMT marker transforming growth factor-beta1 (both mRNA and protein). Epithelial cell markers (E-cadherin, ZO-1) were reduced by DEP, whereas mesenchymal markers (beta-catenin, collagen-1) were increased. DEP reduced both basal and ATP-linked respiration as well as the glycolytic capacity of mitochondria. Concomitantly, DEP profoundly altered mitochondrial morphology and increased the gene expression of A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 1 (a known mitochondrial scaffold protein). Furthermore, DEP significantly affected Epac1 mRNA levels and appeared to increase Epac1 protein, but did not alter the expression of phospho-PKA substrates. Interestingly, DEP increased gene expression levels of several AC family members (AC3, AC6 and AC7), the beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2-AR) and prostanoid E receptor subtype 4 (EP4). Importantly, real-time measurements of cAMP demonstrated that DEP strongly reduced cAMP induced by forskolin (AC activator), fenoterol (beta2-AR agonist) and a stable EP4 agonist, implicating that DEP might limit the therapeutic effects of beta2-AR agonists used to treat lung disorders. Our findings suggest that DEP promotes oxidative stress, inflammation, and EMT. These profound alterations in cellular behavior were accompanied by changes in mitochondrial dysfunction and real-time cAMP dynamics, which may contribute to lung dysfunction induced by air pollution exposure.}

Aberrations in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression are associated with fibrotic diseases, but the role of lncRNAs in silicosis pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the expression of lncRNAs during silicosis and the role of MRAK050699 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Differentially expressed lncRNAs in the lung tissues of normal and silicosis rats were compared, and their biological effects were determined using the Gene Ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. There were 1077 differentially expressed lncRNAs (378 upregulated and 699 downregulated). MRAK052509, MRAK139674, AY539881, MRAK050699, XR{\_}6113, and BC167061 were selected to verify expression in silicosis rats using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. MRAK050699 was knocked down in rat alveolar type II epithelial cells, and the molecular mechanism of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced EMT in these cells was studied. All selected lncRNAs were upregulated in the silicosis rats, consistent with the sequencing results. MRAK050699 knockdown inhibited EMT of RLE-6TN cells by regulating the TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling pathway. Thus, the differential expression of lncRNAs is related to silicosis development, and MRAK050699 plays an important role in EMT, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for silicosis.}

The median follow-up time was 100 months. AR, MR and GRbeta immunocytochemical staining was compared with that of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (vimentin, SIP1, ZEB1).RESULTS: High expression of cytoplasmic MR was associated with dismal local relapse-free survival (RR=13.923; 95{\%}CI=1.071-181.045; p=0.044) in tumours with non-TNBC phenotype. AR and GRbeta were more frequently expressed in ER+/PR+/HER2- tumours, while cytoplasmic MR was more often expressed in TNBC tumours (for all, p<0.0005). GRbeta and AR were associated with decreased vimentin expression (p<0.005), indicating their association with attenuated EMT.CONCLUSION: Cytoplasmic MR expression is a strong predictor of local recurrence in non-metastatic breast cancer patients with non-TNBC tumour phenotype.}

 abstract     = {Androgen receptor (AR), an androgen-activated transcription factor, belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. AR plays an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role of AR in PCa metastasis is not fully understood. To investigate the role of AR in PCa metastasis, we examined AR expression level in primary and metastatic PCa by analyzing gene array data of 378 primary prostate tumors and 120 metastatic prostate tumors from Oncomine, as well as carrying out immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 56 prostate cancer samples. Expression of mRNA and protein of AR as well as its target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was much higher in metastatic prostate tumors than in primary prostate tumors. Knockdown of AR with siRNA or treating with anti-androgen Casodex reduced migration and invasion ability of C4-2B PCa cells. Knockdown of AR increased protein expression of E-cadherin and AR coregulator KAT5 but reduced expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins Slug, Snail, MMP-2, vimentin, and beta-catenin. Knockdown of KAT5 increased migration of C4-2B cells, whereas overexpression of KAT5 suppressed cell migration. KAT5 knockdown rescues the suppressive effect of AR knockdown on migration of C4-2B cells. Gene expression level of AR and KAT5 showed a negative correlation. PCa patients with higher AR expression or lower KAT5 expression correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival. Our study suggested that elevation of AR expression and AR signaling in prostate tumors promotes PCa metastasis by induction of EMT and reduction of KAT5.}

In contrast, the recently identified AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9 may function via degrading the AR protein to simultaneously suppress the PCa cell proliferation and invasion. The details of this unique mechanism, however, remain unclear. Here we found that ASC-J9 could suppress PCa cell invasion via inducing the sumoylation of STAT3, thereby inhibiting the STAT3 phosphorylation that led to suppress the EMT-SNAIL2 signals in both PCa DU145 and PC3 AR-negative cells. Mutation of lysine-679 on the sumoylation site of the STAT3 effectively blocked the ASC-J9-suppressed PCa cell invasion in both invitro cell lines and invivo mouse models. These results suggest that in addition to degrading AR to suppress PCa cell proliferation, ASC-J9 can also function through an AR-independent mechanism via modulating the STAT3 sumoylation to alter the phospho-STAT3 status to suppress the PCa cell invasion. These dual functions of ASC-J9 to suppress PCa proliferation and invasion (via altering STAT3 sumoylation) may help us to develop a better anti-AR compound that may overcome the current antiandrogens' unwanted side-effect of increasing the metastasis to better suppress the castration-resistant PCa progression.}

We also assessed the effects of combination treatment with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and Se on trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) levels. Compared with the control groups, cells incubated with Se (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5 g Se/mL) have lower viability, raised intracellular Se concentrations and SELENO expression, and higher malondialdehyde products in a dose-dependent manner. Se induced the inactivation of AR/IGF-1R/EGFR and downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling molecules. Se-treated cells also exhibited decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced levels of the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1, cancer stemness, metastatic and EMT-related markers, and increased apoptosis. Subsequently, Se treatment significantly suppressed PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 mRNA levels and proteins. Doxorubicin decreased 4T1 cell viability and TROP2 expression levels, but the addition of Se to doxorubicin contributed to further reductions. Similar responses to Se treatment were also observed in the human MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These results show that Se upregulates SELENO and anti-AR/IGF-1R/EGFR signaling in TNBC cells, thus inducing oxidative stress-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, stemness, EMT, and metastasis, as well as blocking the immune checkpoint molecules. TROP2 down-regulation with Se is also a potential anti-TNBC therapeutic target.}

The STRING database was used to construct the protein interaction network of Fritillaria thunbergii Miq and EMs. The overlapping targets and enriched pathways were discovered using the cells of the innate immune annotation database (DAVID) and the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. To test the mechanism of Peiminine, the active ingredients of Fritillaria thunbergii, in the therapy of EMs, we designed cell assays and animal research. EMs mouse models were treated with several therapies, including fibrosis inhibitor in Peiminine by utilizing Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining), MASSON staining, Immunohistochemistry, Immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiment, and Western blotting test. We evaluated the anti-endometriotic effects of Peiminine using 12Z human endometriotic cells. Cell Counting Kit 8 was used to assess the vitality of 12z cells (CCK8). We evaluated the migration ability of 12z cells by cell scratch test.RESULTS: The effective active ingredients of Fritillaria thunbergii Miq in the treatment of EMs are Pelargonidin, Beta-sitosterol syringaresinol, Peimisine Pelargonidin-3, 5-diglucoside Ziebeimine Zhebeiresinol Verticine Solatubin OSI-2040 Chaksine Peiminine Peiminoside Peiminoside{\_}qt, and 6-Methoxyl-2-acetyl-3-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone-8-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The critical targets for Fritillaria thunbergii Miq treating EMs are NOS2/PTGS1/AR/PPARG/PTGS2/NCOA2/RXRA/PGR/NR3C1/NCOA1/SLC6A4/OPRM1/BCL2 and ESR1. The results of GO function and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the role pathway was estrogen-related signaling and thyroid hormone-related signaling. The expression of E-cadherin was decreased in EMs while MEK1/2, P-ERK, N-cadherin and vimentin were all increased in MASSON, immunofluorescence, Real-time PCR and Western blotting. In epithelial 12Z cells, high concentrations of Peiminine can block cell activity and migration, which is directly related to blocking cell fibrosis.CONCLUSION: Overall, this study partially verified the network pharmacological prediction that Peiminine regulates the MAPK pathway in inhibiting 12Z cell proliferation and migration, and finally protects against EMs.}

Firstly, the mRNA and protein level of KIF23 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma was measured using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Then, the influence of KIF23 on tumor metastasis and growth in nasopharyngeal carcinoma was determined through the in vivo and in vitro experiments. Lastly, the regulatory mechanisms of KIF23 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma were illustrated in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. KIF23 was first found to be overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma samples, and its expression was associated with poor prognosis. Then, the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell's proliferation, migration, and invasion potential could be improved by inducing KIF23 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, androgen receptor (AR) was found to bind to the KIF23 promoter region directly and enhance KIF23 transcription. At last, KIF23 could accelerate nasopharyngeal carcinoma deterioration via activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the proportion of drug users among patients with mental disorders who attended the emergency department of one major psychiatric hospital in Northern Israel, the most frequent psychiatric diagnoses associated with drug use, and the impact of confirmed drug use on hospital admission. We hypothesized that the proportion of individuals with positive urine drug test results presenting at the psychiatric emergency department during the study period would be 20{\%} to 30{\%}.METHODS: An unselected cohort of 2,019 adult patients who visited the emergency department of Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health Center, a university-affiliated government facility, was evaluated and underwent routine urine drug testing between April 2012 and February 2014. Clinical, demographic, and urine drug test data were collected from medical records and statistically analyzed, comparing diagnostic evaluation at admission and after discharge from either the emergency department or the hospital. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify the possible variables associated with drug use in this sample.RESULTS: Urine drug test results showed that 194 of the 2,019 subjects (9.6{\%}) had used a psychoactive substance before attending the emergency department. Among patients with positive urine drug test results, the majority (77.8{\%}) used cannabis, 25.8{\%} used opiates, 24.7{\%} used ecstasy, and 5.2{\%} used cocaine. Differences in the prevalence of positive urine drug test results between admitted and nonadmitted patients did not reach a statistically significant level. The frequency of positive urine drug test results across lifetime International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses was 27.2{\%} for substance-related disorders, 4.8{\%} for psychotic disorders, 4.2{\%} for mood disorders, 11.0{\%} for personality disorders, and 11.5{\%} for nonpsychotic disorders. Both univariate and logistic regression analyses revealed that younger age (18-40), male sex, fewer years of education, single marital status, and ICD-10 diagnosis of substance-related, personality, and nonpsychotic disorders were indicators of higher likelihood of positive urine drug test findings.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that routine urine toxicology screening is not necessary in the psychiatric emergency department as an adjunct to a thorough psychiatric clinical examination. However, urine drug tests should be performed when the clinical evaluation cannot determine whether the mental disorder is the result of illicit drug use or clearly non-drug-related.}

This study investigated the impact of androgen receptor (AR) gene expression on the clinical features and progression of PTC. The levels of AR mRNA and protein in frozen, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from PTC and adjacent normal thyroid tissue were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining, respectively, and the relationships between AR expression and clinical features were analyzed. The thyroid cancer cell lines, BCPAP and TPC-1, were used to evaluate the effects of AR on the regulation of cell migration, and key epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. AR mRNA expression was significantly higher in normal thyroid tissue from men than women. The sex difference in AR mRNA expression diminished during PTC tumorigenesis, as AR mRNA expression levels were lower in PTC than normal thyroid tissues from both men and women. AR mRNA expression was significantly decreased in PTC patients with higher risk and in those with extrathyroidal extension. Overexpression of AR in BCPAP cells decreased cell migration and repressed the EMT process by down-regulating mRNA expression of N-cadherin, Snail1, Snail2, Vimentin, and TWIST1 and up-regulating E-cadherin gene expression. These results suggest that suppression of the androgen-AR axis may lead to aggressive tumor behavior in patients with PTC.}

Data for PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 were analyzed daily and as closure variables, a total of 45,595 emergency pediatric consultations for respiratory symptoms or specifically for disorders in the upper and lower airways. To control for confounders, other variables were included in the model including those relating to weather, seasonality, temperature, relative air humidity, rain volume, respiratory infections and the calendar effects (such as holidays and weekends). A Poisson regression was applied using generalized counting models to estimate the effects of pollutants and confusing factors.RESULTS: Only O3 had a positive and statistically significant effect, both among emergency consultations for respiratory problems and consultations for symptoms relating to the lower airways. Effect and exposure occurred on the same day (lag 0). A significant negative association was found with CO and pediatric consultations for respiratory complaints. Other air pollutants were not found to have a significant effect.CONCLUSIONS: There were found associations between outdoor air pollution and the number of emergency pediatric consultations for respiratory problems in the studied area, in spite of the fact that the levels of all pollutants monitored during the study period were below recommended levels.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer progression is navigated by the androgen receptor (AR) and transforming-growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling. We previously demonstrated that aberrant TGF-beta signaling accelerates prostate tumor progression in a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer via effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), driving castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).METHODS: This study examined the antitumor effect of the combination of TGF-beta receptor I (TbetaRI) inhibitor, galunisertib, and FDA-approved antiandrogen enzalutamide, in our pre-clinical model. Age-matched genotypically characterized DNTGFbetaRII male mice were treated with either galunisertib and enzalutamide, in combination or as single agents in three "mini"-trials and the effects on tumor growth, phenotypic EMT, and actin cytoskeleton were evaluated.RESULTS: Galunisertib in combination with enzalutamide significantly suppressed prostate tumor growth, by increasing apoptosis and decreasing cell proliferation of tumor cell populations compared to the inhibitor as a monotherapy (P<0.05). The combination treatment dramatically reduced cofilin levels, actin cytoskeleton regulator, compared to single agents. Treatment with galunisertib targeted nuclear Smad4 protein (intracellular TGF-beta effector), but had no effect on nuclear AR. Consequential to TGF-beta inhibition there was an EMT reversion to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and re-differentiation of prostate tumors. Elevated intratumoral TGF-beta1 ligand, in response to galunisertib, was blocked by enzalutamide.CONCLUSION: Our results provide novel insights into the therapeutic value of targeting TGF-beta signaling to overcome resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer by phenotypic reprogramming of EMT towards tumor re-differentiation and cytoskeleton remodeling. This translational work is significant in sequencing TGF-beta blockade and antiandrogens to optimize therapeutic response in CRPC.}

 abstract     = {Advanced prostate cancer will claim nearly 30,000 lives among men in the USA in the year 2013. Most of these will be castration-resistant prostate cancers that are not responsive to traditional therapeutic modalities, and there is no available regimen that fully eradicates metastatic disease. This poses a significant clinical challenge for practitioners and has stimulated the development of novel agents that target these castration-resistant tumor cells. Development of metastatic prostate cancer is orchestrated by multiple signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, apoptosis, anoikis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, the androgen signaling axis and angiogenesis. Disruption of the mechanisms underlying these processes is critical for development of agents that can target otherwise resistant tumor cells. Insights into the mechanisms by which rounds of EMT/mesenchymal-epithelial transition conversions facilitate the progression of localized prostate carcinomas to advanced metastatic and castration-resistant disease emerge as attractive targets for drug development. In this review, the authors discuss the current understanding of therapeutic resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer with focus on the androgen receptor signaling axis and EMT. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting critical players of both pathways as well as the results from ongoing clinical trials will be discussed in this review.}

To explore whether X-ray irradiation could reverse the acquired gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cell in vitro. We chose a human NSCLC cell line NCI-H1975 to establish acquired gefitinib-resistant cell line named as NCI-H1975/GR. NCI-H1975/GR was irradiated with X-ray and then named as NCI-H1975/GR/XR. In the three cell lines, subsequently cell growth curves and cell population doubling time were calculated by cell proliferation assay, the changes of cell viability were evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion method and MTT assay, the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry, the expressions of E-cadherin and vimentin used to indicate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were determined by western blot analysis, the protein expressions in EGFR/KRAS/BRAF transduction pathway were detected by immunocytochemistry, and the mutations of EGFR, KRAS and BRAF were detected by high resolution melting analysis and direct sequencing. We found that the X-ray irradiation enhanced the growth inhibitory effects of gefitinib on the acquired gefitinib-resistant cell line. Of NCI-H1975/GR/XR following gefitinib treatment, the IC50 decreased significantly, the cell proportion of phase G0/G1 was slightly higher, and the apoptosis cell proportion was significantly higher than those of NCI-H1975/GR. In addition, the reversal of EMT being present in NCI-H1975/GR cells was likely appearing in NCI-H1975/GR/XR cells. These results indicated that the acquired gefitinib resistance could be reversed by X-ray irradiation in NSCLC cell line NCI-H1975 harboring both the L858R and T790M mutation in vitro.}

 abstract     = {Treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) has changed considerably in the last decade due to the introduction of novel androgen receptor (AR)-targeted agents (ARTAs) for patients progressing on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Preclinical research however still relies heavily on AR-negative cell line models. In order to investigate potential differences in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) growth, we set out to create a comprehensive panel of ARTA-progressive models from 4 androgen-responsive AR wild-type PCa cell lines and analyzed its androgen response as opposed to its ADT-progressive counterparts. Parallel cultures of VCaP, DuCaP, PC346C, and LAPC4 were established in their respective culture media with steroid-stripped fetal calf serum (FCS) [dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FCS (DCC)] without androgen (ADT) or in DCC plus 1 muM of the ARTAs bicalutamide, OH-flutamide, or RD162 (an enzalutamide/apalutamide analog). Cell growth was monitored and compared to those of parental cell lines. Short-term androgen response was measured using cell proliferation 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. qRT-PCR was performed to assess the mRNA expression of markers for AR signaling, steroidogenesis, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and WNT signaling. Out of 35 parallel cultures per cell line, a total of 24, 15, 34, and 16 CRPC sublines emerged for VCaP, DuCaP, PC346C, and LAPC4, respectively. The addition of bicalutamide or OH-flutamide significantly increased CRPC growth compared to ADT or RD162. VCaP, DuCaP, and PC346C CRPC clones retained an AR-responsive phenotype. The expression of AR and subsequent androgen response were completely lost in all LAPC4 CRPC lines. Markers for EMT and WNT signaling were found to be elevated in the resilient PC346C model and CRPC derivatives of VCaP, DuCaP, and LAPC4. Although the resistant phenotype is pluriform between models, it seems consistent within models, regardless of type of ARTA. These data suggest that the progression to and the phenotype of the CRPC state might already be determined early in carcinogenesis.}

 abstract     = {FoxA1 (FOXA1) is a pioneering transcription factor of the androgen receptor (AR) that is indispensible for the lineage-specific gene expression of the prostate. To date, there have been conflicting reports on the role of FoxA1 in prostate cancer progression and prognosis. With recent discoveries of recurrent FoxA1 mutations in human prostate tumors, comprehensive understanding of FoxA1 function has become very important. Here, through genomic analysis, we reveal that FoxA1 regulates two distinct oncogenic processes via disparate mechanisms. FoxA1 induces cell growth requiring the AR pathway. On the other hand, FoxA1 inhibits cell motility and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through AR-independent mechanism directly opposing the action of AR signaling. Using orthotopic mouse models, we further show that FoxA1 inhibits prostate tumor metastasis in vivo. Concordant with these contradictory effects on tumor progression, FoxA1 expression is slightly upregulated in localized prostate cancer wherein cell proliferation is the main feature, but is remarkably downregulated when the disease progresses to metastatic stage for which cell motility and EMT are essential. Importantly, recently identified FoxA1 mutants have drastically attenuated ability in suppressing cell motility. Taken together, our findings illustrate an AR-independent function of FoxA1 as a metastasis inhibitor and provide a mechanism by which recurrent FoxA1 mutations contribute to prostate cancer progression.}

Many eCDS tools, however, are designed and implemented without taking into account the context in which clinical work is performed. Implementation of the pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) clinical decision rule at one Level I pediatric emergency department includes an electronic questionnaire triggered when ordering a head computed tomography using computerized physician order entry (CPOE). Providers use this CPOE tool in less than 20{\%} of trauma resuscitation cases. A human factors engineering approach could identify the implementation barriers that are limiting the use of this tool.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to design a pediatric TBI eCDS tool for trauma resuscitation using a human factors approach. The hypothesis was that clinical experts will rate a usability-enhanced eCDS tool better than the existing CPOE tool for user interface design and suitability for clinical use.METHODS: This mixed-methods study followed usability evaluation principles. Pediatric emergency physicians were surveyed to identify barriers to using the existing eCDS tool. Using standard trauma resuscitation protocols, a hierarchical task analysis of pediatric TBI evaluation was developed. Five clinical experts, all board-certified pediatric emergency medicine faculty members, then iteratively modified the hierarchical task analysis until reaching consensus. The software team developed a prototype eCDS display using the hierarchical task analysis. Three human factors engineers provided feedback on the prototype through a heuristic evaluation, and the software team refined the eCDS tool using a rapid prototyping process. The eCDS tool then underwent iterative usability evaluations by the five clinical experts using video review of 50 trauma resuscitation cases. A final eCDS tool was created based on their feedback, with content analysis of the evaluations performed to ensure all concerns were identified and addressed.RESULTS: Among 26 EPs (76{\%} response rate), the main barriers to using the existing tool were that the information displayed is redundant and does not fit clinical workflow. After the prototype eCDS tool was developed based on the trauma resuscitation hierarchical task analysis, the human factors engineers rated it to be better than the CPOE tool for nine of 10 standard user interface design heuristics on a three-point scale. The eCDS tool was also rated better for clinical use on the same scale, in 84{\%} of 50 expert-video pairs, and was rated equivalent in the remainder. Clinical experts also rated barriers to use of the eCDS tool as being low.CONCLUSIONS: An eCDS tool for diagnostic imaging designed using human factors engineering methods has improved perceived usability among pediatric emergency physicians.}

Compared with the control group treated with normal saline, EMT in the kidneys of offspring rats undergoing 8 weeks of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 treatment (at a dose of 30 mg/kg) was significantly inhibited, the degree of renal fibrosis was significantly reduced, and the renal function was significantly improved. DBP (10 mumol/L) activated the RhoA/ROCK pathway and induced EMT in NRK-52E cells in vitro. Both 5 muM and 10 muM Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, significantly reduced the EMT of NRK-52E cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the RhoA/ROCK pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis in offspring rats induced by maternal exposure to DBP via promoting EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells.}

 abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) mortality remains a significant public health problem, as advanced disease has poor survivability due to the development of resistance in response to both standard and novel therapeutic interventions. Therapeutic resistance is a multifaceted problem involving the interplay of a number of biological mechanisms including genetic, signaling, and phenotypic alterations, compounded by the contributions of a tumor microenvironment that supports tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis. The androgen receptor (AR) is a primary regulator of prostate cell growth, response and maintenance, and the target of most standard PCa therapies designed to inhibit AR from interacting with androgens, its native ligands. As such, AR remains the main driver of therapeutic response in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), in combination with microtubule-targeting taxane chemotherapy, offers survival benefits in patients with mCRPC, therapeutic resistance invariably develops, leading to lethal disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance is critical to improving therapeutic outcomes and also to the development of biomarker signatures of predictive value. The interconversions between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) navigate the prostate tumor therapeutic response, and provide a novel targeting platform in overcoming therapeutic resistance. Both microRNA (miRNA)- and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms have been associated with epigenetic changes in prostate cancer. This review discusses the current evidence-based knowledge of the role of the phenotypic transitions and novel molecular determinants (non-coding RNAs) as contributors to the emergence of therapeutic resistance and metastasis and their integrated predictive value in prostate cancer progression to advanced disease.}

The system uses an external power source that communicates bidirectionally with the IPG (<1.5cm3). Human factors, subject comfort, and effects on low back and leg pain were evaluated in this first-in-human study.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, open-label clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the safety and performance of a novel miniaturized stimulator in the treatment of chronic, intractable leg and low-back pain. Eligible subjects were recruited for the study and gave consent. Subjects who passed the screening/trial phase (defined as ≥ 50{\%} decrease in pain) continued to the long-term implant phase and were followed up at predefined time points after device activation. Interim clinical and usability outcomes were captured and reported at 90 days.RESULTS: Results of 22 subjects who chose a novel pulsed stimulation pattern therapy using the battery-free IPG (<1.5cm3) are described here. At 90-days follow-up, the average pain reduction was 79{\%} in the leg (n= 22; p< 0.0001) and 76{\%} in the low back (n= 21; p< 0.0001) compared with baseline. Responder rates (≥ 50{\%} pain relief) at 90 days were 86{\%} in leg pain (19/22) and 81{\%} in low-back pain (17/21). Subjects rated the level of comfort of the external wearable power source to be 0.41{\textpm}0.73 at 90 days on an 11-point rating scale (0= very comfortable, 10= very uncomfortable).DISCUSSION: These interim results from the ongoing study indicate the favorable efficacy and usability of a novel, externally powered, battery-free SCS IPG (< 1.5 cm3) for leg and low-back pain. Study subjects wore the external power source continuously and found it comfortable, and the system provided significant pain relief. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Clinicaltrials.gov registration number for the study is ACTRN12618001862235.}

Although first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs were standard first-line treatments, acquired resistance (AR) to these drugs is almost inevitable. Cell line models have been widely used to explore the molecular mechanisms of AR to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Many research groups, including ours, have established AR cell lines that harbor the EGFR T790M secondary mutation, MET gene amplification, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, which are all found in clinical specimens obtained from TKI-refractory lesions. Currently, many oncologists prescribe osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI that can overcome T790M-mediated resistance, as a first-line TKI. Although few clinical data are available about AR mechanisms that arise when osimertinib is used as a first-line therapy, many research groups have established cell lines with AR to osimertinib and have reported on their AR mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the findings on AR mechanisms against first-line osimertinib obtained from analyses of cell line models.}

 abstract     = {Inhaled glucocorticosteroids (GSs) cause acute, alpha1-adrenoreceptor (AR)-mediated bronchial vasoconstriction. After release from sympathetic nerves, norepinephrine (NE) must be taken up into cells for deactivation by intracellular enzymes. Because postsynaptic cellular NE uptake is steroid sensitive, GSs could increase NE concentrations at alpha1-AR, causing vasoconstriction. We therefore evaluated mRNA expression of different NE transporters in human bronchial arterial smooth muscle and pharmacologically characterized NE uptake into these cells. RT-PCR demonstrated mRNA expression of the extraneuronal monoamine transporter (EMT) and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT-1). Fluorometric uptake assay showed time (within minutes)- and concentration-dependent NE uptake by freshly isolated bronchial arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) with an estimated Km of 240 microM. Corticosterone and O-methylisoprenaline (1 microM each), but not desipramine, inhibited NE uptake, a profile indicative of NE uptake by EMT, but not OCT-1. Budesonide and methylprednisolone inhibited uptake with IC50 values of 0.9 and 5.6 microM, respectively. Corticosterone's action was reversible and not sensitive to RU-486 (GS receptor antagonist), actinomycin D (transcription inhibitor), or cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor). Corticosterone made membrane impermeant by coupling to BSA also blocked NE uptake. Immunocytochemistry indicated a specific membrane binding site for corticosterone on bronchial arterial SMC. These data demonstrate that although human bronchial arterial SMC express OCT-1 and EMT, EMT is the predominant plasma membrane transporter for NE uptake. This process can be inhibited by GSs, likely via a specific membrane binding site. This nongenomic GS action (increasing NE concentrations at alpha1-AR) could explain acute bronchial vasoconstriction caused by inhaled GSs.}

 abstract     = {The key to preventing mCRPC progression is understanding how androgen-dependent PCa cells progress to independence and modify their transcriptional repertoire accordingly. We recently identified a novel axis of the Hippo pathway characterized by the sequential kinase cascade induced by androgen deprivation, AR->TLK1B>NEK1>pYAP1-Y407, leading to CRPC adaptation. Phosphorylation of YAP1-Y407 increases upon ADT or induction of DNA damage, correlated with the known increase in NEK1 expression/activity, and this is suppressed in the Y407F mutant. Dominant expression of YAP1-Y407F in Hek293 cells reprograms the YAP1-mediated transcriptome to reduce TEAD- and p73-regulated gene expression and mediates sensitivity to MMC. NEK1 haploinsufficient TRAMP mice display reduced YAP1 expression and, if castrated, fail to progress to overt prostate carcinomas, even while displaying reduced E-Cadherin (E-Cad) expression in hyperplastic ductules. YAP1 overexpression, but not the Y407F mutant, transforms LNCaP cells to androgen-independent growth with a mesenchymal morphology. Immunohistochemical examination of prostate cancer biopsies revealed that the pYAP1-Y407 nuclear signal is low in samples of low-grade cancer but elevated in high GS specimens. We also found that J54, a pharmacological inhibitor of the TLK1>NEK1>YAP1 nexus leading to degradation of YAP1, can suppress the transcriptional reprogramming of LNCaP cells to androgen-independent growth and EMT progression, even when YAP1-WT is overexpressed.}

Establishing trauma system and patient's treatment in pediatric trauma centers, where child gets urgent and sufficient help, reduces mortality and improves outcomes. Pediatric patient's triage using patient's status scoring and trauma scoring systems is recommended. The role of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure is crucial.

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the delivery of evidence-based therapies targeting posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been the focus of the Departments of Defense in countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States. More than 66{\%} of military members continue to experience symptoms of PTSD that significantly impact their daily functioning and quality of life after completing evidence-based treatments. Innovative, engaging, and effective treatments for PTSD are needed. Multimodal motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) is an exposure-based, virtual reality-supported therapy used to treat military members and veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Given the demonstrated efficacy of 3MDR in recently published randomized control trials, there is both an interest in and a need to adapt the intervention to other populations affected by trauma and to improve accessibility to the treatment.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to further innovate, develop, and validate new and existing hardware and software components of 3MDR to enhance its mobility, accessibility, feasibility, and applicability to other populations affected by trauma, including public safety personnel (PSP), via international collaboration.METHODS: This study used a modified Delphi expert consultation method and mixed methods quasi-experimental validation with the purpose of software validation among PSP (first responders, health care providers) participants (N=35). A team of international experts from the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada met on the web on a weekly basis since September 2020 to discuss the adoption of 3MDR in real-world contexts, hardware and software development, and software validation. The evolution of 3MDR hardware and software was undertaken followed by a mixed methods software validation study with triangulation of results to inform the further development of 3MDR.RESULTS: This study resulted in the identification, description, and evolution of hardware and software components and the development of new 3MDR software. Within the software validation, PSP participants widely acknowledged that the newly developed 3MDR software would be applicable and feasible for PSP affected by trauma within their professions. The key themes that emerged from the thematic analysis among the PSP included the desire for occupationally tailored environments, individually tailored immersion, and the applicability of 3MDR beyond military populations.CONCLUSIONS: Within the modified Delphi consultation and software validation study, support for 3MDR as an intervention was communicated. PSP participants perceived that 3MDR was relevant for populations affected by trauma beyond military members and veterans. The resulting hardware and software evolution addressed the recommendations and themes that arose from PSP participants. 3MDR is a novel, structured, exposure-based, virtual reality-supported therapy that is currently used to treat military members and veterans with PTSD. Going forward, it is necessary to innovate and adapt 3MDR, as well as other trauma interventions, to increase effectiveness, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and efficacy among other populations affected by trauma.}

Anti-androgen therapy for this subtype is in development, but yields only partial clinical benefits. In this study, we aimed to characterize the genomic alterations of LAR TNBC, to analyze activation of the PI3K signaling pathway and to compare the response to PI3K pathway inhibitors with that to anti-androgen therapy in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of LAR TNBC. Methods: Four LAR PDX models were identified, on the basis of their transcriptomic profiles, in a cohort of 57 PDX models of TNBC. The expression of AR-related genes, basal and luminal cytokeratins and EMT genes was analyzed by RT-PCR and IHC. AKT1 and PIK3CA mutations were identified by targeted NGS, and activation of the PI3K pathway was analyzed with a reverse-phase protein array. Three LAR PDXs with a PIK3CA or AKT1 mutation were treated with the AR inhibitor enzalutamide, a PI3K inhibitor, a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor and a mTORC1-mTORC2 inhibitor. Finally, we screened a clinical cohort of 329 TNBC for PIK3CA and AKT1 hotspot mutations. Results: LAR TNBC PDXs were significantly enriched in PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations, and had higher levels of luminal-androgen-like gene expression and a higher PI3K pathway protein activation score than other TNBC subtypes. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed strong expression of the luminal cytokeratin CK18 and AR in three LAR PDX models. We found that mTOR and PI3K inhibitors had marked antitumor activity in vivo in PDX harboring genomic alterations of PIK3CA and AKT1 genes that did not respond to the AR antagonist enzalutamide. PIK3CA mutations were detected in more than one third of AR+ TNBC from patients (38{\%}), and only 10{\%} of AR-negative TNBC. Conclusion: Our results for PDX models of LAR TNBC resistant to enzalutamide indicate that PIK3CA and AKT1 are potential therapeutic targets.}

The study, which included 224 participants, was designed as a mixed method and included questionnaires and semi-structured interviews of participants. The data were analyzed to understand the factors that influenced nurses' attitudes toward the use of computer technology. The research findings show that the more clearly nurses understand the positive impact of using technology on the quality of care, the more positive their response to changes in registration and reporting methods. It is not surprising that the research findings found that cognitive instrumental processes and social influence processes have a positive effect on the perceived usefulness of using computer technologies. The unusual finding was the fact that cognitive instrumental processes were the main factor influencing the assimilation of computer technology even though nursing is a social profession.}

This study investigated the therapeutic value of DZ-50 agent in in vitro and in vivo models of advanced prostate cancer and the ability of the compound to overcome resistance to antiandrogen (enzalutamide) in prostate tumors.APPROACH: LNCaP and LNCaP-enzalutamide resistant human prostate cancer (LNCaP-ER) cells, as well as 22Rv1 and enzalutamide resistant, 22Rv1-ER were used as cell models. The effects of DZ-50 and the antiandrogen, enzalutamide (as single agents or in combination) on cell death, EMT-MET interconversion, and expression of IGFBP3 and the androgen receptor (AR), were examined. The TRAMP mouse model of prostate cancer progression was used as a pre-clinical model. Transgenic mice (20-wks of age) were treated with DZ-50 (100 mg/kg for 2 wks, oral gavage daily) and prostate tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical assessment of apoptosis, cell proliferation, markers of EMT and differentiation and IGFBP-3 and AR expression. A tissue microarray (TMA) was analyzed for expression of IGBP-3, the target of DZ-50 and its association with tumor progression and biochemical recurrence.RESULTS: We found that treatment with DZ-50 enhanced the anti-tumor response to the antiandrogen via promoting EMT to MET interconversion, in vitro. This DZ-50-mediated phenotypic reversal to MET leads to prostate tumor re-differentiation in vivo, by targeting nuclear IGFBP-3 expression (without affecting AR). Analysis of human prostate cancer specimens and TCGA patient cohorts revealed that overexpression of IGBP-3 protein correlated with tumor recurrence and poor patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide significant new insights into (a) the predictive value of IGFBP-3 in prostate cancer progression and (b) the antitumor action of DZ-50, [in combination or sequencing with enzalutamide] as a novel approach for the treatment of therapeutically resistant prostate cancer.}

 abstract     = {Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a highly aggressive disease with few therapeutic options. Hyperactive androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a key role in CRPC progression. Previously, we identified RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (RORgamma) as a novel key driver of AR gene overexpression and increased AR signaling. We report here that several RORgamma antagonists/inverse agonists including XY018 and compound 31 were orally effective in potent inhibition of the growth of tumor models including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. RORgamma controls the expression of multiple aggressive-tumor gene programs including those of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. We found that PDZ binding kinase (PBK), a serine/threonine kinase, is a downstream target of RORgamma that exerts the cellular effects. Alterations of RORgamma expression or function significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein level of PBK. Our further analyses demonstrated that elevated PBK associates with and stabilizes RORgamma and AR proteins, thus constituting novel, interlocked feed-forward loops in hyperactive AR and RORgamma signaling. Indeed, dual inhibition of RORgamma and PBK synergistically inhibited the expression and function of RORgamma, AR, and AR-V7, and the growth and survival of CRPC cells. Therefore, our study provided a promising, new strategy for treatment of advanced forms of prostate cancer.}

In this study, we aimed to assess the wearability of an elec‑ tronic bracelet using multiple evaluation methods, including the evaluation of range of motion (ROM), air gap (AG), and clothing pressure (CP) at the wearer's wrist, as well as self-scoring of subjective comfort (SC). We recruited eight Korean male participants (N=8) who were in their 30 s and did not have any musculoskeletal problems at data collection. We compared the test results collected on the frst day with those obtained after wearing the electronic wrist bracelet for 5 consecutive days. We also examined the diferences between the normal-weight and overweight groups. Overall, the data evinced a decrease in the wrist ROM, AG, and SC, but an increase in the CP after it was worn for 5 days. And, the results were more observable in the overweight group, as compared to the normal-weight group. Furthermore, this study proposed a novel and efective assessment tool that could be used to measure the wearability of devices or systems intended to be worn on the human bodynot only the electronic wrist bracelet for criminal monitoring but also popular commercial electronic bracelets for sportswear or health-related monitoring system.}

Aberrant Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) signaling has been implicated in advanced prostate cancer (PCa), and FGFR1 is suggested to be a promising therapeutic target along with current androgen deprivation therapy. We established a novel in vitro 3D culture system to study endogenous FGFR signaling in a rare subpopulation of prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the cell lines PC3, DU145, LNCaP, and the induced pluripotent iPS87 cell line. 3D-propagation of PCa cells generated spheroids with increased stemness markers ALDH7A1 and OCT4, while inhibition of FGFR signaling by BGJ398 or Dovitinib decreased cell survival and proliferation of 3D spheroids. The 3D spheroids exhibited altered expression of EMT markers associated with metastasis such as E-cadherin, vimentin and Snail, compared to 2D monolayer cells. TKI treatment did not result in significant changes of EMT markers, however, specific inhibition of FGFR signaling by BGJ398 showed more favorable molecular-level changes than treatment with the multi-RTK inhibitor Dovitinib. This study provides evidence for the first time that FGFR1 plays an essential role in the proliferation of PCa CSCs at a molecular and cellular level, and suggests that TKI targeting of FGFR signaling may be a promising strategy for AR-independent CRPC.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Sex workers (SWs) experience a disproportionately high burden of HIV, with evidence indicating that complex and dynamic factors within work environments play a critical role in mitigating or producing HIV risks in sex work. In light of sweeping policy efforts to further criminalize sex work globally, coupled with emerging calls for structural responses situated in labour and human-rights frameworks, this meta-synthesis of the qualitative and ethnographic literature sought to examine SWs' narratives to elucidate the ways in which physical, social and policy features of diverse work environments influence SWs' agency to engage in HIV prevention.METHODS: We conducted a meta-synthesis of qualitative and ethnographic studies published from 2008 to 2014 to elucidate SWs' narratives and lived experiences of the complex and nuanced ways in which physical, social, and policy features of indoor and outdoor work environments shape HIV prevention in the sex industry.RESULTS: Twenty-four qualitative and/or ethnographic studies were included in this meta-synthesis. SWs' narratives revealed the nuanced ways that physical, social, and policy features of work environments shaped HIV risk and interacted with macrostructural constraints (e.g., criminalization, stigma) and community determinants (e.g., sex worker empowerment initiatives) to shape SWs' agency in negotiating condom use. SWs' narratives revealed the ways in which the existence of occupational health and safety standards in indoor establishments, as well as protective practices of third parties (e.g., condom promotion) and other SWs/peers were critical ways of enhancing safety and sexual risk negotiation within indoor work environments. Additionally, working in settings where negative interactions with law enforcement were minimized (e.g., working in decriminalized contexts or environments in which peers/managers successfully deterred unjust policing practices) was critical for supporting SWs' agency to negotiate HIV prevention.CONCLUSIONS: Policy reforms to remove punitive approaches to sex work, ensure supportive workplace standards and policies, and foster SWs' ability to work collectively are recommended to foster the realization of SWs' health and human rights across diverse settings. Future qualitative and mixed-methods research is recommended to ensure that HIV policies and programmes are grounded in SWs' voices and realities, particularly in more under-represented regions such as Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.}

 abstract     = {The mechanisms by which prostate cancer (PCa) progresses to the aggressive castration-resistant stage remain uncertain. Zinc finger of the cerebellum 5 (ZIC5), a transcription factor belonging to the ZIC family, is involved in the pathology of various cancers. However, the potential effect of ZIC5 on PCa malignant progression has not been fully defined. Here, we show that ZIC5 is upregulated in PCa, particularly in metastatic lesions, in positive association with poor prognosis. Genetic inhibition of ZIC5 in PCa cells obviously attenuated invasion and metastasis and blunted the oncogenic properties of colony formation. Mechanistically, ZIC5 functioned as a transcription factor to promote TWIST1-mediated EMT progression or as a cofactor to strengthen the beta-catenin-TCF4 association and stimulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Importantly, ZIC5 and the androgen receptor (AR) form a positive feed-forward loop to mutually stimulate each other's expression. AR, in cooperation with its steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3), increased ZIC5 expression through binding to the miR-27b-3p promoter and repressing miR-27b-3p transcription. In turn, ZIC5 potentiated AR, AR-V7, and AR targets' expression. Besides, ZIC5 inhibition reduced AR and AR-V7 protein expression and enhanced the sensitivity of PCa to enzalutamide (Enz) treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate that the reciprocal activation between AR and ZIC5 promotes metastasis and Enz resistance of PCa and suggest the therapeutic value of cotargeting ZIC5 and AR for the treatment of advanced PCa.}

Patient-specific predictions on treatment response are, however, urgently needed, given the severe side effects of alemtuzumab. This study developed a multidimensional prediction model with the aim of generating clinically useful prognostic scores for the response to alemtuzumab. Clinical and histological characteristics were collected retrospectively from patients who were treated with alemtuzumab for AR. In addition, targeted gene expression profiling of AR biopsy tissues was performed. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression modeling was used to construct the ALEMtuzumab for Acute Rejection (ALEMAR) prognostic score. Response to alemtuzumab was defined as patient and allograft survival and at least once an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >30mL/min/1.73m2 during the first 6months after treatment. One hundred fifteen patients were included, of which 84 (73{\%}) had a response to alemtuzumab. The ALEMAR-score accurately predicted the chance of response. Gene expression analysis identified 13 differentially expressed genes between responders and nonresponders. The combination of the ALEMAR-score and selected genes resulted in improved predictions of treatment response. The present preliminary prediction model is potentially helpful for the development of stratified alemtuzumab treatment for acute kidney transplant rejection but requires validation.}

 abstract     = {The major challenge in the treatment of patients with advanced lethal prostate cancer is therapeutic resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy. Overriding this resistance requires understanding of the driving mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment, not just the androgen receptor (AR)-signaling cascade, that facilitate therapeutic resistance in order to identify new drug targets. The tumor microenvironment enables key signaling pathways promoting cancer cell survival and invasion via resistance to anoikis. In particular, the process of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), directed by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), confers stem cell properties and acquisition of a migratory and invasive phenotype via resistance to anoikis. Our lead agent DZ-50 may have a potentially high efficacy in advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by eliciting an anoikis-driven therapeutic response. The plasticity of differentiated prostate tumor gland epithelium allows cells to de-differentiate into mesenchymal cells via EMT and re-differentiate via reversal to mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) during tumor progression. A characteristic feature of EMT landscape is loss of E-cadherin, causing adherens junction breakdown, which circumvents anoikis, promoting metastasis and chemoresistance. The targetable interactions between androgens/AR and TGF-beta signaling are being pursued towards optimized therapeutic regimens for the treatment of mCRPC. In this review, we discuss the recent evidence on targeting the EMT-MET dynamic interconversions to overcome therapeutic resistance in patients with recurrent therapeutically resistant prostate cancer. Exploitation of the phenotypic landscape and metabolic changes that characterize the prostate tumor microenvironment in advanced prostate cancer and consequential impact in conferring treatment resistance are also considered in the context of biomarker discovery.}

All age groups and injury severity were included except those who arrived dead, had no attendant and when the injury time was unknown.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to death measured in hours from injury time up to the 30th day of the injuries. Secondary outcomes were prehospital first aid, length of hospital stay and hospital arrival time. The article has been registered, with a unique identification number of research registry 6556.RESULTS: A total of 454 victims were followed for 275534 person hours. There were 80 deaths with an overall incidence of 2.90 deaths per 10000 person hours of observation (95{\%}CI 2.77 to 3.03). The significant predictors of time to death were being a driver (AHR=2.26; 95{\%}CI 1.09 to 4.65, AR=14.8), accident at interurban roads ((AHR (Adjusted HAzard Ratio=1.98; 95{\%}CI 1.02 to 3.82, AR (Attributable Risk)=21{\%})), time from injury to hospital arrival (AHR=0.41; 95{\%}CI 0.16 to 0.63; AR=3{\%}), systolic blood pressure on admission of <90mm Hg (AHR=3.66; 95{\%}CI 2.14 to 6.26; AR=57{\%}), Glasgow Coma Scale of <8 (AHR=7.39; 95{\%}CI 3.0819 to 17.74464; AR=75.7{\%}), head injury with polytrauma (AHR=2.32 (1.12774 4.79; AR=37{\%}) and interaction of distance from hospital with prehospital care.CONCLUSION: Though the maturation of trauma centres in many developed countries has changed the temporal pattern of deaths following any trauma, our study demonstrated that trauma deaths follow the traditional trimodal pattern. That implies that potentially preventable causes of death continued in low-resource countries.}

The proprietary compound galeterone (gal) was designed to inhibit proliferation of androgen/androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cell in vitro and in vivo and is currently in phase III clinical development. Additionally, clinical studies with gal revealed its superb efficacy in four different cohorts of patients with mCRPC, including those expressing splice variant AR-V7. Preclinical studies with gal show that it also exhibits strong antiproliferative activities against AR-negative prostate cancer cells and tumors through a mechanism involving phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, which forms an integral component of the eukaryotic mRNA translation complex. Thus, we hypothesized that gal and its new analog, VNPT55, could modulate oncogenic mRNA translation and prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. We report that gal and VNPT55 profoundly inhibit migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, possibly by down-regulating protein expression of several EMT markers (Snail, Slug, N-cadherin, vimentin, and MMP-2/-9) via antagonizing the Mnk-eIF4E axis. In addition, gal/VNPT55 inhibited both NF-kappaB and Twist1 transcriptional activities, down-regulating Snail and BMI-1 mRNA expression, respectively. Furthermore, profound up-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression may explain the observed significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, expression of self-renewal proteins, beta-catenin, CD44, and Nanog, was markedly depleted. Analysis of gal/VNPT55-treated CWR22Rv1 xenograft tissue sections also revealed that observations in vitro were recapitulated in vivo. Our results suggest that gal/VNPT55 could become promising agents for the prevention and/or treatment of all stages of prostate cancer.}

We established house dust mite-induced AR mouse model and treated AR mice with ibrutinib. The symptoms of AR, serum level of immunoglobulin E, percentage of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg in nasal lymphoid tissues were monitored. We also established in vitro T cell differentiation cell culture model. The T cells were treated with ibrutinib and the expression of specific transcriptional factors and cytokines was measured. The activation of PLC-gamma1/calcium/NFAT2 signaling pathway was detected. Ibrutinib treatment had no effects on the development of lymphocytes and myeloid cells, but alleviated AR symptoms and decreased Th2 cell population in nasal lymphoid tissue. Meanwhile, iburitnib suppressed Th2 and Th17 differentiation in vitro. Moreover, iburitnib prevented phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1and nuclear translocation of NFAT2 in Th2 cells. Our results suggested that ibrutinib could ameliorate AR symptoms through suppression of Th2 differentiation in AR mouse model.}

 abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequent type of cancer in men worldwide, with 288,300 new cases and 34,700 deaths estimated in the United States in 2023. Treatment options for early-stage disease include external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, active surveillance, or a combination of these. In advanced cases, androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is considered the first-line therapy; however, PCa in most patients eventually progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) despite ADT. Nonetheless, the transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent tumors is not yet fully understood. The physiological processes of epithelial-to-non-epithelial ("mesenchymal") transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) are essential for normal embryonic development; however, they have also been linked to higher tumor grade, metastatic progression, and treatment resistance. Due to this association, EMT and MET have been identified as important targets for novel cancer therapies, including CRPC. Here, we discuss the transcriptional factors and signaling pathways involved in EMT, in addition to the diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that have been identified in these processes. We also tackle the various studies that have been conducted from bench to bedside and the current landscape of EMT-targeted therapies.}

Cryptotanshinone (CTS), a herbal extract, has been proven with therapeutic effects on various diseases. However, the effects and possible mechanisms of CTS in BPH have not yet been elucidated. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of CTS on the BPH-associated pathological processes and the possible mechanisms underlying it. Herein, CTS was intragastrically administrated to estradiol/testosterone (E2/T) (1:100)-induced BPH rats, and finasteride (Fi) was used as the positive control. Human benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cells (BPH-1) and normal human prostate stromal cells (WPMY-1) were used for the in vitro experiments. Results indicated that E2/T injection was able to induce BPH manifestation, featured with increased prostate index. Furthermore, it accelerated proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stromal collagen deposition, and inhibited apoptosis of rat prostate. However, the administration of CTS partially reversed the changes mentioned above. The therapeutic effects of CTS on BPH were also confirmed by in vitro experiments. The efficacy of CTS on these processes might be attributed to the suppression of AR and EGFR/STAT3 axis activity. In conclusion, CTS might suppress BPH progression by modulating proliferation, apoptosis, EMT, and stromal collagen deposition via suppressing AR and EGFR/STAT3 axis.}

 abstract     = {Current therapeutic regimens for prostate cancer focus on targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the AR is a key factor in luminal epithelium differentiation and was shown to have a role as a tumor suppressor. Thus, its inhibition may activate oncogenic pathways that contribute to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Herein, we report a novel tumor promoter, ZBTB46, which is negatively regulated by AR signaling via microRNA (miR)-1-mediated downregulation. ZBTB46 is associated with malignant prostate cancer and is essential for metastasis. Its overexpression can overcome the antitumor effects of miR-1 and promote androgen-independent proliferation. We demonstrated that ZBTB46 can transcriptionally regulate SNAI1, a key epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driver, which could contribute to induction of the EMT after androgen-deprivation therapy and metastasis. Our findings are supportive of the model that disruption of AR's function may predispose prostate cancer to progress to metastatic CRPC.}

 abstract     = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a molecular process connected to higher expression of vimentin and increased activity of transcription factors (Snail, Twist) which restrains E-cadherin. EMT has been linked to prostate cancer metastatic potential, therapy resistance, and poor outcomes. Kinetin riboside (9-(b-dribofuranosyl)-6-furfurylaminopurine, KR) is a naturally occurring cytokinin, which induces apoptosis and shows strong antiproliferative activity against various human cancer cell lines. To establish the effect of KR on human prostate cell lines, expression of, e.g. AR, E-, N-cadherins, Vimentin, Snail, Twist, and MMPs, was analysed at mRNA and protein levels using Western Blot and RT-PCR and/or RQ-PCR techniques. KR inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cells, but also, to a small extent, of normal cells. This effect depended on the type of the cells and their androgen sensitivity. KR also decreased the level of p-Akt, which takes part in androgen signalling modulation. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated in cancer cell lines, while that of Bax is up-regulated upon KR exposure. KR contributed to re-expression of the E-cadherin as well as to significant changes in cell migration. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that KR can be proposed as a factor for signalling pathways regulation that participates in the inhibition of development of aggressive forms of prostate cancer, and may alter the approach to therapeutic interventions. We propose KR as a potent inhibitor of EMT in human prostate cells.}

To understand their functions in prostate, we established a transgenic mouse model (AR3Tg) with targeted expression of the constitutively active and androgen-independent AR splice variant AR3 (a.k.a. AR-V7) in prostate epithelium. We found that overexpression of AR3 modulates expression of a number of tumor-promoting autocrine/paracrine growth factors (including Tgfbeta2 and Igf1) and expands prostatic progenitor cell population, leading to development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In addition, we showed that some epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated genes are up-regulated in AR3Tg prostates, suggesting that AR3 may antagonize AR activity and halt the differentiation process driven by AR and androgen. This notion is supported by our observations that the number of Ck5(+)/Ck8(+) intermediate cells is increased in AR3Tg prostates after castration, and expression of AR3 transgene in these intermediate cells compromises prostate epithelium regeneration upon androgen replacement. Our results demonstrate that AR3 is a driver of prostate cancer, at least in part, through modulating multiple tumor-promoting autocrine/paracrine factors.}

However, the role of ERbeta1 in the metastasis of androgen receptor (AR)-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown.METHODS: Stable ERbeta1-expressing TNBC cell lines were generated for this study. We detected the abilities of cell migration and invasion by wound-healing and transwell assays and the expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting assays in TNBC cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed to assess the effect of AR on ERbeta1 promoter. Tumor metastasis was evaluated in vivo using a lung metastasis mouse model. Lastly, immunohistochemical expression of ERbeta1 in TNBC tissues was analyzed and correlated with clinicopathological features.RESULTS: ERbeta1 suppressed the invasion and migration abilities of AR-positive TNBC cells and induced the downregulation of ZEB1. ZEB1 overexpression abrogated the increase in E-cadherin expression and the decrease in N-cadherin expression modulated by ERbeta1. A lung metastasis mouse model showed that the incidence of metastasis was lower in ERbeta1-expressing TNBC cells. Further, AR activation increased the anti-metastatic effect of ERbeta1 in AR-positive TNBC cells, which accelerated ERbeta1 transcription by functioning as a transcription factor that bound to the promoter of ERbeta1. No significant change was observed in AR expression induced by ERbeta1. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of TNBC clinical samples showed that ERbeta1 and AR were positive in 31.7{\%} and 23.2{\%} of samples, respectively. ERbeta1 expression was negatively correlated with ZEB1 expression and lymph node metastasis, and positively correlated with the expression of AR and E-cadherin.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested a potential role of ERbeta1 in metastasis of AR-positive TNBC and provided novel insights into the mechanism of action of ERbeta1 and the possible relationship between ERbeta1 and AR.}

In the early 2010s, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) adopted targeted HTC strategies for populations and geographical areas most affected by HIV. We examine how Pepfar defined targeted HTC in Cote d'Ivoire, a country with a mixed HIV epidemic, after a decade of expanding HTC services.METHODS: We explored the evolution of HTC strategies through the Country Operational Plans (COP) of Pepfar during its phase 3.0, from COP 14 to COP 17 (October 2014 to September 2018) in Cote d'Ivoire. We conducted an analysis of the grey literature over the period 2014 to 2018 (Budget {\&} Target Report, Strategic Direction Summary, Sustainability Index and Dashboard Summary, https://data.pepfar.gov). We also conducted a qualitative study in Cote d'Ivoire (2015 to 2018) using in-depth interviews with stakeholders in the AIDS public response: CDC/Pepfar (3), Ministry of Health (3), intermediary NGOs (7); and public meeting observations (14).RESULTS: Since the COP 14, Pepfar's HIV testing strategies have been characterized by significant variations in terms of numerical, geographical and population targets. While the aim of COP 14 and COP 15 seemed to be the improvement of testing efficacy in general and testing yield in particular, COP 16 and COP 17 prioritized accelerating progress towards the "first 90" (i.e. reducing the proportion of people living with HIV who are unaware of their HIV). A shift was observed in the definition of testing targets, with less focus on the inclusion of programmatic data and feedback from field actors, and greater emphasis on the use of models to estimate and disaggregate the targets by geographical units and sub-populations (even if the availability of data by this disaggregation was limited or uncertain); increasingly leading to gaps between targets and results.CONCLUSIONS: These trials and tribulations question the real and long-term effectiveness of annually-revised, fragmented strategies, which widen an increasing disparity between the realities of the actors on the ground and the objectives set in Washington.}

Conventional therapies targeting androgen signaling driven tumor growth have provided limited survival benefit in patients. Recent identification of the critical molecular and cellular events surrounding tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis to the bone as well as other sites provide new insights in targeting advanced disease. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process via which epithelial cells undergo morphological changes to a motile mesenchymal phenotype, a phenomenon implicated in cancer metastasis but also therapeutic resistance. Therapeutic targeting of EMT has the potential to open a new avenue in the treatment paradigm of CRPC through the reversion of the invasive mesenchymal phenotype to the well differentiated tumor epithelial tumor phenotype. Overcoming therapeutic resistance in metastatic prostate cancer is an unmet need in today's clinical management of advanced disease. This review outlines our current understanding of the contribution of EMT and its reversal to MET in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, and the impact of selected targeting of mechanisms of resistance via EMT towards a therapeutic benefit in patients with CRPC.}

On 6 February 2020, seven deaths were reported following a hazardous chemical leakage in a village in Uttar Pradesh, India. We investigated the event to identify the cause and propose recommendations.Methods: We defined a case as sudden onset of breathlessness, headache, or death in the village, 6-7 February 2020. We conducted a house-to-house case search and calculated attack rate (AR) and case-fatality rate (CFR) by age and gender. We conducted an environmental investigation at the leakage site and sent the chemicals for forensic analysis. We obtained the cause of death through autopsy reports.Results: Out of 2,942 residents, we identified 23 cases (AR = 8/1,000) and seven deaths (CFR = 30{\%}). The median age of the case was 42 years (range, 2-64 years). The AR was higher among males (14/1,000 [19/1,402]). All the 23 case-patients who were sleeping at the chemical leakage site or visited to witness the event developed symptoms, and all seven cases who were sleeping within 150 meters of the leakage site died. The environmental investigation revealed leakage of hazardous substances from the storage tank. Toxicology analysis confirmed the leaked chemical as Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane), and autopsy reports confirmed the cause of death as asphyxia.Conclusions: Asphyxia following the leakage of Lindane from the storage tank possibly led to sudden deaths. We recommend using leak-proof tanks to ensure safe storage and disposal, law enforcement, and regulations to prevent people from staying close to chemical storage sites.}

In addition, the usability and the information transfer were compared with a tablet.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to a robot or tablet group with their consent prior to MRI. The usability of both devices was compared with the extended System Usability Scale (SUS) and the information transfer with a knowledge query. Reasons for refusal were collected by a non-responder questionnaire.RESULTS: At the University Hospital Halle 117 patients were included for participation. There was no statistically significant difference in gender and age. Of 18 non-responders, 4refused to participate partly because of the robot; for another 3 the reason could not be clarified. The usability according to SUS score was different with statistical significance between the groups in the mean comparison and was one step higher for the tablet on the adjective scale. There was no statistically significant difference in knowledge transfer. On average, 8.41 of 9 questions were answered correctly.CONCLUSION: This study is the first application, in a clinical radiological setting, of a humanoid robot interacting with patients. Tablet and robot are suitable for information transfer in the context of MRI. In comparison to studies in which the willingness to interact with a robot in the health care sector was investigated, the willingness is significantly higher in the present study. This could be explained by the fact that it was a concrete use case that was understandable to the participants and not a hypothetical scenario. Thus, potentially high acceptance for further specific areas of application of robots in radiology can be assumed.

 abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: GESIDA and the AIDS National Plan panel of experts suggest preferred (PR), alternative (AR), and other regimens (OR) for antiretroviral treatment (ART) as initial therapy in HIV-infected patients for the year 2016. The objective of this study is to evaluate the costs and the efficacy of initiating treatment with these regimens.METHODS: Economic assessment of costs and efficiency (cost/efficacy) based on decision tree analyses. Efficacy was defined as the probability of reporting a viral load <50copies/mL at week 48 in an intention-to-treat analysis. Cost of initiating treatment with an ART regimen was defined as the costs of ART and its consequences (adverse effects, changes of ART regimen, and drug resistance studies) during the first 48 weeks. The payer perspective (National Health System) was applied, only taking into account differential direct costs: ART (official prices), management of adverse effects, studies of resistance, and HLA B*5701 testing. The setting is Spain and the costs correspond to those of 2016. A sensitivity deterministic analysis was conducted, building three scenarios for each regimen: base case, most favourable, and least favourable.RESULTS: In the base case scenario, the cost of initiating treatment ranges from 4663 Euros for 3TC+LPV/r (OR) to 10,894 Euros for TDF/FTC+RAL (PR). The efficacy varies from 0.66 for ABC/3TC+ATV/r (AR) and ABC/3TC+LPV/r (OR), to 0.89 for TDF/FTC+DTG (PR) and TDF/FTC/EVG/COBI (AR). The efficiency, in terms of cost/efficacy, ranges from 5280 to 12,836 Euros per responder at 48 weeks, for 3TC+LPV/r (OR), and RAL+DRV/r (OR), respectively.CONCLUSION: Despite the overall most efficient regimen being 3TC+LPV/r (OR), among the PR and AR, the most efficient regimen was ABC/3TC/DTG (PR). Among the AR regimes, the most efficient was TDF/FTC/RPV.}

The purpose of this research study was to examine the ability of the PSM-shirt to accurately detect heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) when worn under structural fire fighting personal protective equipment (PPE) during the performance of various activities relevant to fire fighting. Eleven healthy, college-aged men completed three activities (walking, searching/crawling, and ascending/descending stairs) that are routinely performed during fire fighting operations while wearing the PSM-shirt under structural fire fighting PPE. Heart rate and RR recorded by the PSM-shirt were compared to criterion values measured concurrently with an ECG and portable metabolic measurement system, respectively. For all activities combined (overall) and for each activity, small differences were found between the PSM-shirt and ECG (mean difference [95{\%} CI]: overall: -0.4 beats/min [-0.8, -0.1]; treadmill: -0.4 beats/min [-0.7, -0.1]; search: -1.7 beats/min [-3.1, -.04]; stairs: 0.4 beats/min [0.04, 0.7]). Standard error of the estimate was 3.5 beats/min for all tasks combined and 1.9, 5.9, and 1.9 beats/min for the treadmill walk, search, and stair ascent/descent, respectively. Correlations between the PSM-shirt and criterion heart rates were high (r = 0.95 to r = 0.99). The mean difference between RR recorded by the PSM-shirt and criterion overall was 1.1 breaths/min (95{\%} CI: -1.9 to -0.4). The standard error of the estimate for RR ranged from 4.2 breaths/min (treadmill) to 8.2 breaths/min (search), with an overall value of 6.2 breaths/min. These findings suggest that the PSM-shirt provides valid measures of HR and useful approximations of RR when worn during fire fighting duties.}

In this system, ENU produces revertants at a frequency of 3 x 10(-4), equivalent to that of the commonly used mutagen, EMS. The gene identity of 154 ENU-induced revertants shows that the distribution of alleles between three possible suppressor genes differs from induced by EMS. A higher percentage of revertants are alleles of unc-93 and many fewer are alleles of sup-9 and sup-10. Three revertants complement the three known suppressor genes; they may therefore identify a new gene product(s) involved in this system of excitation-contraction coupling in C. elegans. Molecular characterization of putative unc-93 null alleles reveals that the base changes induced by ENU are quite different from those induced by EMS; specifically we see an increased frequency of A/T-->G/C transitions. The frequency of ENU-induced intragenic deletions is found to be 13{\%}. We suggest that ENU, at concentrations below 5 mM, will be a superior mutagen for studies of protein function in C. elegans.}

The starting dose of topotecan was 1.25 mg/m2/day given intravenously over 30 min for 5 consecutive days. Patients were eligible for response evaluation if they completed more than one cycle of topotecan. All patients were evaluated for toxicity.RESULTS: Of 28 patients eligible for response evaluation, 26 were resistant to both platinum and paclitaxel prior to treatment with topotecan. There were four partial responders and no complete responders for a total response rate of 14{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 4 to 33{\%}). All responders had exhibited primary resistance to both platinum and paclitaxel. Myelotoxicity was the major toxicity, with 92{\%} of patients experiencing Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 67{\%} experiencing GOG grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Other toxicity was minimal and easily managed. Fifty percent of patients receiving more than one cycle of topotecan tolerated a dose equal or greater to the starting dose.CONCLUSIONS: Topotecan exhibits activity in patients with ovarian cancer resistant to both platinum and paclitaxel. Further study is warranted in less heavily pretreated patients and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.}

 abstract     = {Recently, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) was identified as the first histone demethylase. LSD1 interacted with androgen receptor (AR) and promoted androgen-dependent transcription of target genes, such as PSA, by ligand-induced demethylation of mono- and dimethylated histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9). Meanwhile, the phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) had received considerable attention in tumor recurrence and metastasis. This study examined the effect of Pargyline (an inhibitor of LSD1) on the process of EMT invitro and invivo. SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with LNCap cells. Pargyline was given intraperitoneally or not after castration (implemented with Bilateral orchidectomy), then PSA levels in serum and tumor were determined to assess time to androgen-independent progression. The results showed that LSD1 expression was up-regulated when PCa progressed to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Pargyline reduced LNCap cells migration and invasion ability, and inhibited the process of EMT by up-regulating expression of E-cadherin, and down-regulating expressions of N-cadherin and Vimentin invitro and invivo. Although, Pargyline did not change the level of AR, it reduced PSA expression both invitro and invivo. Furthermore, Pargyline delayed prostate cancer transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent state (CRPC). These findings indicated that inhibition of LSD1 might be a promise adjunctive therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.}

This study identified differences in various body measurements between occupational groups in the USA, as determined in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Approximately 16,000 of its 32,900 subjects were associated with an occupational group. The analysis of the data showed that the body size, or body segment measurements, of some occupational groups differ significantly. For example, agricultural workers were shorter by an average of 2.5 cm in height, and had wider wrist breadths, than other workers. Female agricultural and manufacturing workers had larger waist circumferences than those in the 'other occupations' and 'all occupations' categories. Protective service workers (i.e. firefighters, police and guards) were taller and heavier (7 kg heavier for males and over 10 kg heavier for females) than those in all occupations combined. These differences and other deviations as well as some age-and-ethnicity-adjusted results were tabulated for users' reference. Researchers and designers who use anthropometric databases to evaluate human-machine interfaces and personal protective equipment (PPE) must use caution in selecting databases that are adequate for their occupational applications.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Opioid analgesics are commonly prescribed on an as-needed (PRN) basis for acute painful conditions. Uncertainty of how patients actually take PRN opioids, coupled with a desire to completely cover pain, leads to variable and overly generous opioid prescribing practices, resulting in a surplus of opioids. This opioid surplus becomes a source for diversion and nonmedical opioid use. Understanding patterns of actual opioid ingestion after acute painful conditions can help clinicians counsel patients on safe opioid use, and allow timely recognition and intervention when escalating opioid self-dosing occurs, to prevent tolerance and addiction.METHODS: We used a novel oxycodone digital pill system (ingestible biosensor within a standard gelatin capsule combined with 5-mg oxycodone) that when ingested, is activated by the chloride ion gradient in the stomach thereby emitting a radiofrequency signal captured by a wearable reader. The reader relays ingestion data to a cloud-based server that displays ingestion events to the study team. We deployed the oxycodone digital pill among opioid-naive individuals discharged from the emergency department with acute fracture pain. Participants were trained on digital pill operation and discharged with twenty-one 5-mg oxycodone digital pills. They were instructed to take digital pills PRN for pain on discharge. We conducted a brief interview 7 days after study enrollment, at which point participants returned the digital pill system. We identified oxycodone ingestion events in real time by data from the digital pill system and performed pill counts at the return visit to validate digital pill reporting of medication ingestion.RESULTS: In this study, 26 individuals were approached; 16 enrolled with 15 completing the study. Participants ingested a median of 6 (3-9.5) oxycodone digital pills over the course of 7 days, with 82{\%} of the oxycodone dose ingested in the first 3 days. In individuals who required operative repair, 86{\%} (N = 6) continued to ingest opioids at 1 week. There was substantial variability in ingestion patterns between individuals.CONCLUSIONS: The utilization patterns of individuals with acute fracture pain could be captured using a digital pill system and revealed a median opioid ingestion of 45-mg morphine equivalents for acute pain over 7 days. Seven participants ceased using opioids within 4 days after discharge from the emergency department, although operative repair was associated with longer use. This digital pill system was able to measure changes in and patterns of opioid self-dosing, which varied between patients.}

All other things being equal (e.g. dose, route of administration), a replicating vector should give a higher efficiency of gene transfer than a nonreplicating vector due to local spread from the initially transduced cells. Almost any virus could provide the basis for a replicating gene transfer vector but, for the treatment of human cancer, the choice is greatly constrained by issues of public safety and potential efficacy. Public safety considerations point to viruses of low pathogenicity which are already prevalent in the human population whilst efficacy considerations point to viruses which replicate efficiently in the tumor cells to be targeted. Additional factors influencing the suitability of individual viruses as a basis for replicating vectors include the availability of an infectious molecular clone, the capacity for foreign gene insertion, genomic stability, potential for targeting by coat protein engineering or promoter engineering, cell-cycle dependence and availability of an effective vaccine.}

Studies on its regulation have mostly focused on the negative 3'UTR binding of miR200c. Interestingly, it has been previously reported that androgen receptor (AR) regulates ZEB1 expression in breast and prostate cancers. In order to validate this, various ZEB1 promoter deletions were cloned into a luciferase reporter system to elucidate the contribution of two putative androgen response elements (AREs). The in vivo contribution of AR was also assessed in cell lines after R1881 treatment using qPCR with prostate specific antigen (PSA) as the positive control. We discovered that AR upregulates the levels of expression of ZEB1 10-fold on a luciferase promoter that only contains the distal ARE. However, when the proximal ARE is included, no additional activation is apparent with AR or its hormone independent variant, AR-V7. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that a promoter construct containing both AREs activates transcription of ZEB1 even in the AR-null cell lines DU145 and PC3. Incubation of the AR-positive cell line, LNCaP with R1881, failed to substantially increase the expression levels of ZEB1. Despite the presence of AREs in the promoter region, it appears that ZEB1 expression can be induced even without AR. In addition, the region around the distal ARE is a potent repressor in AR-null cell lines.}

 abstract     = {Increased wildfire activity has led to renewed interest in enhancing local capacity to reduce wildfire risk in residential areas. Local fire departments (LFDs) are often the first responders to rural wildfires. However, LFDs may also struggle to address service demands in the growing wildland urban interface, including increasing numbers of wildfire incidents and changes in area socio-demographics (e.g., aging populations) or culture (e.g., decreasing volunteerism, new residents). We used a mixed-mode survey (n=770) to explore rural perceptions of various fire service organizations (FSOs), including LFDs, in wildfire-prone areas of northeastern Washington State, USA. We also explore relationships between perceptions of LFD capabilities or capacity (e.g., personnel, LFD ability to respond to private property during a wildfire event) and resident performance of eleven wildfire risk mitigation activities that contribute to home defense (e.g., development of a water supply, installing sprinklers). We found that study participants have relatively high levels of trust in LFD's to respond to a wildfire event on their properties. This trust is also slightly higher than the amount of trust placed in other FSOs (e.g., state, federal, private contractors). Respondents also largely understand that LFDs do not have sufficient capacity or capability to respond when wildfire events impact multiple private properties in their area. Trust in LFDs was significantly and negatively correlated with resident installation of fire-resistant siding, installation of sprinklers on their home, and placing firewood or lumber more than 30 feet (9m) from their dwelling. Similarly, respondents' perceptions of LFD capacity and capabilities was significantly and negatively correlated with purchasing a generator and stacking firewood more than 30 feet (9m) from their home. Our results suggest that perceptions of FSOs have the potential associations with resident performance of select wildfire mitigation actions (e.g., firewood placement, installation of non-flammable siding). However, they also were not significantly related to many other mitigations suggested for residents to complete as part of broader wildfire management strategies (e.g., driveway clearance, water supply establishment, safe zone creation).}

 abstract     = {Advanced prostate cancer patients initially respond to hormone therapy, be it in the form of androgen deprivation therapy or second-generation hormone therapies, such as abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. However, most men with prostate cancer eventually develop hormone therapy resistance. This resistance can arise through multiple mechanisms, such as through genetic mutations, epigenetic mechanisms, or through non-genetic pathways, such as lineage plasticity along epithelial-mesenchymal or neuroendocrine-like axes. These mechanisms of hormone therapy resistance often co-exist within a single patient's tumor and can overlap within a single cell. There exists a growing need to better understand how phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity results from emergent dynamics of the regulatory networks governing androgen independence. Here, we investigated the dynamics of a regulatory network connecting the drivers of androgen receptor (AR) splice variant-mediated androgen independence and those of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Model simulations for this network revealed four possible phenotypes: epithelial-sensitive (ES), epithelial-resistant (ER), mesenchymal-resistant (MR) and mesenchymal-sensitive (MS), with the latter phenotype occurring rarely. We observed that well-coordinated "teams" of regulators working antagonistically within the network enable these phenotypes. These model predictions are supported by multiple transcriptomic datasets both at single-cell and bulk levels, including in vitro EMT induction models and clinical samples. Further, our simulations reveal spontaneous stochastic switching between the ES and MR states. Addition of the immune checkpoint molecule, PD-L1, to the network was able to capture the interactions between AR, PD-L1, and the mesenchymal marker SNAIL, which was also confirmed through quantitative experiments. This systems-level understanding of the driver of androgen independence and EMT could aid in understanding non-genetic transitions and progression of such cancers and help in identifying novel therapeutic strategies or targets.}

 abstract     = {Intelligent human identification using face information has been the research hotspot ranging from Internetof Things (IoT) application, intelligent self-service bank, intelligent surveillance to public safety and intelligentaccess control. Since 2D face images are usually captured from a long distance in an unconstrained environment,to fully exploit this advantage and make human recognition appropriate for wider intelligent applicationswith higher security and convenience, the key difficulties here include gray scale change caused byillumination variance, occlusion caused by glasses, hair or scarf, self-occlusion and deformation caused bypose or expression variation. To conquer these, many solutions have been proposed. However, most of themonly improve recognition performance under one influence factor, which still cannot meet the real facerecognition scenario. In this paper we propose a multi-scale parallel convolutional neural network architectureto extract deep robust facial features with high discriminative ability. Abundant experiments are conductedon CMU-PIE, extended FERET and AR database. And the experiment results show that the proposedalgorithm exhibits excellent discriminative ability compared with other existing algorithms.}

 abstract     = {The development of Metaverse is expected to bring diversity and abundance in our life experiences. However, to enjoy such merits of Metaverse, it is essential to take proactive measures to deter harmful acts in Metaverse against the legally protected interests. This certainly applies to the property interest as well as many other different types of interests. The economic activities in Metaverse will be discouraged without a proper protection of rights on the virtual assets in Metaverse which are essentially intangible data possessing characteristics of property:  independence, specificity, exclusiveness.In the Metaverse incorporating XR, Tracking, Haptic and NFT technologies, the harms against property interest may take the form of theft and robbery as well as fraud and hacking. However, current relevant substantive criminal law limits the object element of the crime―which is ``property''―to the tangible property excluding the possibility to criminalize the harmful acts against the intangible property such as virtual items or assets in Metaverse. Particularly, considering that the substantive criminal law on theft limits the object element of the crime only to the ``property''―unlike the fraud or robbery which includes not only the property but also the ``gains''―, lack of law enforcement against the theft in Metaverse is foreseeable.Thus, this paper suggests that substantive criminal law on property crimes should expand the object element of the crimes to include the intangible property as well as tangible property by escaping from the old standard failing to reflect the changes in reality. As legislatures adopted the Article 346 of Criminal Act to expand the object element of the property crimes to reflect the changes caused by the electricity based Second Industrial Revolution, it is a high time to consider legislative measures to incorporate the intangible data often visualized as virtual items and assets in Metaverse―the representative industry of data driven Fourth Industrial Revolution―into the object element of the property crimes in our substantive criminal law.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The readmission rate could be a valuable tool as measurement of hospital quality. Readmissions are due to several factors: clinical, hospital related and patient related. We analyze readmission to internal medicine in a hospital of third level.MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 11 months in 1988 we counted all readmissions (R) defined as every previous admission occurred in a span of five years into an area of internal medicine composed by 8 beds. We counted number of readmssions, time from the last readmission, living area (city vs country), sort of primary care physician (GP vs family care specialist), living way (single, with family, institution, homeless). Precipitating factors were observed as well as diseases causing it. R were classified as R related (RR) when readmission was provoked by the same pathological condition or a complication. Multi-readmission (MR), those R caused by the same disease process and treated in different areas and services of the hospital. Avoidable R (AR), those R which did not fullfil AEP criteria. Early readmission (ER) those R occurring before 30 days after last discharge.RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven patients (mean age 67.93 (SD 15.51), males 64{\%}, mean length of stay 7.75 (SD 4.35), 93{\%} admitted from emergency yard, mortality rate 3.5{\%}) were included. R were 111 (35.5{\%}), RR 83 (26 and 75{\%} of RR), MR 68 (82{\%} of RR), ER 33 (39.7{\%} of RR) and AR 16 (19.2{\%} of RR) patients. The most frequent diseases were heart failure and chronic respiratory diseases. Main causes of R were worsening of chronic disease 41 (37{\%}), non-appropriale ambulatory management 24 (22{\%}) erroneous diagnosis 8 (7{\%}), iatrogenic effect 7 (6{\%}), new disease 29 (26{\%}) and others 2 (2{\%}). Mortality rate in R patients was 7.2{\%} (confidence interval 95{\%} 2 to 9{\%}). Number of readmissions were 3.22 (SD 2.25) and time to readmission 8.99 (SD 11.96) months. Living in city (p < 0.05) and to be cared by family physician (p < 0.01) both were factors accelerating readmission. Patients with RR had a higher number of readmissions (3.55 SD 2.23 p < 0.001) and they occurred sooner (8.03 SD 11.85) (p < 0.01). There was a trend to higher readmission rate in female (p 0.052). Fifty-seven percent of RR patients did not have consultation with primary care physician (p < 0.05) (confidence interval 95{\%} 3 to 39{\%}). Consultation with primary care yielded a delay in readmission of 5 months (p < 0.01). Patients with MR had an increased number of readmissions (p < 0.01). Associated factors were iatrogenic effect (p < 0.05), non-appropriate ambulatory management (p < 0.001) and worsening chronic disease (p < 0.001). Patients with ER were readmitted 0.45 (SD 0.30) months after the last discharge and they had a higher mortality rate (p < 0.05). Patients with AR had a mean length of stay shorter (p < 0.05), a trend to higher readmission rate (p = 0.06) and sooner (p = 0.08) with a null mortality rate (p < 0.01). As risk factors for RR in logistic regression were identified MR, AR, ER and causes of readmission consisting in worsening of chronic disease, non-appropriate ambulatory management, erroneous diagnosis and iatrogenic effect.CONCLUSIONS: Our readmission rate is 26{\%}, chronic respiratory diseases and heart failure being the main diseases. Over 39{\%} of causes of readmission could be preventable and there is a facilitation phenomenon in number and time to readmission caused by previous readmissions. Risk factors for readmission in internal medicine are multi-readmission, early and avoidable readmission and as specific causes worsening of chronic disease, non-appropriate ambulatory management, erroneous diagnosis and iatrogenic effect.}

Families with two occupationally active or a single occupationally active parent had 0.63 days off work per day of hospitalization. The most prolonged periods of hospitalization were associated with fewest days off work per day of hospitalization. The most important forms of absence from work were holidays and absence without pay, while the right which Danish parents have of absence on the first day of the child's illness formed the basis for 15{\%} of the days off work. The majority of days off work did not result in decrease in pay but parents used their holidays or free days to which they were entitled to a great extent. Three mothers lost their jobs in connection with days off work on account of illness in the child. In addition to employment problems, there were also problems in connection with transport and in caring for the siblings. In many families negative reactions were observed in the siblings.}

The authors recorded phenotypic characteristics at birth and external masculinisation score (EMS), registered longitudinal growth, circulating levels of testosterone, estradiol, luteinising hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin-B and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), in addition to phenotype at postpubertal follow up.RESULTS: The EMS ranged from 5 to 12 in PAIS at birth. Six patients were born with hypospadias and all patients developed gynaecomastia in puberty. Eight of the patients received testosterone treatment. At follow-up penile size was impaired irrespective of EMS at birth, but responded to pubertal androgen therapy in some of the patients. Serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, SHBG and LH, but not FSH and inhibin B, were markedly elevated in puberty. Final height was 181.3 cm (165.7-190.5 cm) corresponding to an SD score of 0.7 (-2.1 to +2.1 SD, n=10).CONCLUSION: Gynaecomastia and impaired phallic growth are frequently observed in adults with PAIS, but may be ameliorated by androgen therapy. The authors suggest that male patients presenting with gynaecomastia in puberty, and elevated circulating levels of testosterone, estradiol and LH in puberty, but normal FSH, should be suspected of having PAIS and undergo genetic testing for AR mutations.}

Defibrillator damage employing DSED is a theoretical concern expressed by defibrillator manufacturers yet the incidence of damage during resuscitation remains unknown.Objective: We sought to explore the incidence of defibrillator damage employing DSED for RVF during OHCA.Methods: We conducted a survey of EMS agencies, authors of previous publications, EMS medical directors, base hospital medical oversight groups, and defibrillator manufacturers to assess the incidence of defibrillator damage during DSED. Our survey focused on the frequency of DSED use, number of shocks used during DSED, technique used to employ DSED (simultaneous or sequential), and the incidence of defibrillator damage during DSED. We specifically targeted groups that were known to be using DSED in clinical practice.Results: Our survey response rate was 50{\%} (65/129): 61{\%} (34/56) EMS medical directors, 60{\%} (6/10) authors, 100{\%} (8/8) base hospitals, 33{\%} (1/3) defibrillator manufacturers, 31{\%} (16/52) paramedic services. In our case-based analysis the overall incidence of defibrillator damage was 0.4{\%}. The incidence of defibrillator damage based on total number of DSED shocks was estimated between 0.11{\%} and 0.22{\%}. All reported cases of defibrillator damage occurred using a simultaneous defibrillation technique.Conclusion: When DSED is employed using either a sequential or simultaneous technique the rate of defibrillator damage appears to be exceedingly low. Further high-quality evidence is required to determine the impact of DSED on patient centered outcomes, but the incidence of defibrillator damage should not limit it use. Defibrillator damage should continue to be monitored in future trials and clinical practice.}

However, there are rare studies to assess the direct effect of the fear of death on disease progression.METHODS: Xenograft pancreatic cancer animal models were established in nude mice. Fear stress was induced to tumor bearing mice by closely housing with a cat and depressive behaviors were measured using open field test, forced swimming test, and sucrose consumption test. Plasma adrenaline concentration was measured using ELISA.RESULTS: Fear stress induced depression-like behaviors in tumor bearing mice which were accompanied with increases in tumor growth, plasma adrenaline levels as well as the protein expression of alpha 2 adrenergic receptor (alpha2 AR) and beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) in tumor tissues. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (Pro) treatment blocked the effect of stress on tumor growth in pancreatic cancer xenograft animal model, but had no effects on the levels of plasma adrenaline level, and alpha2 AR and beta2-AR expression in tumor tissues. Moreover, fear stress increased Frizzled-1, Wnt1, vimentin, but decreased E-cadherin protein expression in tumor tissues, while Pro reversed the effects of fear stress on the expression of these proteins.CONCLUSION: Fear of death impacted the growth of PDAC tumor though activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Treating pancreatic cancer patients with beta-adrenergic antagonist implicates an effective strategy to treat cancer including PDAC.}

 abstract     = {Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is defined by tumor microenvironment heterogeneity affecting intrinsic cellular mechanisms including dysregulated androgen signaling, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), and aberrant activation of transcription factors including androgen receptor (AR) and c-Myc. Using in vitro, in vivo, and animal models, we find a direct correlation between miR-644a downregulation and dysregulation of essential cellular processes. MiR-644a downregulated expression of diverse tumor microenvironment drivers including c-Myc, AR coregulators, and antiapoptosis factors Bcl-xl and Bcl2. Moreover, miR-644a modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by directly targeting EMT-promoting factors ZEB1, cdk6, and Snail. Finally, miR-644a expression suppresses the Warburg effect by direct targeting of c-Myc, Akt, IGF1R, and GAPDH expression. RNA sequencing analysis revealed an analogous downregulation of these factors in animal tumor xenografts. These data demonstrate miR-644a mediated fine-tuning of oncogenesis, stimulating pathways and resultant potentiation of enzalutamide therapy in CRPC patients. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that miR-644a therapeutically influences the CRPC tumor microenvironment by suppressing androgen signaling and additional genes involved in metabolism, proliferation, Warburg effect, and EMT, to potentiate the enzalutamide therapy.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/8/1844/F1.large.jpg.}

 abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men world-wide and is known to be affected by the action of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) via androgen receptor (AR). Resveratrol (Res) as a phytochemical in grapes and red wine has diverse biological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-cancer. CXCR4 as a chemokine receptor has been found to be upregulated in cancer metastasis and has been used as a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. In this study, we focused on the role of DHT in the induction of prostate cancer progression by affecting the AR and CXCR4 pathway. Also, we investigated the inhibition effect of resveratrol on DHT-induced prostate cancer metastasis. In cell viability assay, DHT increased the cell viability of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, on the other hand, Res and its combination with bicalutamide (BCT) as an AR-antagonist or AMD3100 as a CXCR4 inhibitor significantly reduced the cell viability promoted by DHT. Trans-well migration assay and wound healing assay represented the similar results with cell viability assay. According to the results of TUNEL assay, the apoptotic activity was induced by treatment of Res. As results of western blot analysis, the expression of AR, CXCR4, p-PI3K, and p-AKT and the downstream genes related with cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were decreased and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes was increased by treatment of Res and its combination with BCT or AMD3100. This study would suggest that Res and its combination with AR and CXCR4 antagonists can be used in order to suppress the metastatic behaviors of prostate cancer.}

 abstract     = {Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the main treatment to prolong survival in advance stage prostate cancer (PCa) but associated resistance leads to the development of terminal castrate resistant PCa (CRPC). Current research demonstrates that prostate cancer stem cells (PCSC) play a critical role in the development of treatment resistance and subsequent disease progression. Despite uncertainty surrounding the origin of these cells, studies clearly show they are associated with poorer outcomes and that ADT significantly enhances their numbers. Here in we highlight how activation of HIF signalling, in response to hypoxic conditions within the tumour microenvironment, results in the expression of genes associated with stemness and EMT promoting PCSC emergence which ultimately drives tumour relapse to CRPC. Hypoxic conditions are not only enhanced by ADT but the associated decrease in AR activation also promotes PI3K/AKT signalling which actively enhances HIF and its effects on PCSC's. Furthermore, emerging evidence now indicates that HIF-2alpha, rather than the commonly considered HIF-1alpha, is the main family member that drives PCSC emergence. Taken together this clearly identifies HIF and associated pathways as key targets for new therapeutic strategies that could potentially prevent or slow PCSC promoted resistance to ADT, thus holding potential to prolong patient survival.}

The molecular profile of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) overlaps with that of basal-like breast cancers that in turn show similarities with high-grade serous ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. L1CAM is an established biomarker for the latter cancers and we showed before that approximately 18{\%} of primary breast cancers are positive for L1CAM and have a bad prognosis. Here we analysed the expression of L1CAM breast cancer subtypes.METHODS: We analyzed mRNA and protein expression data from different breast cancer cohorts for L1CAM, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Her-2 and Androgen receptor (AR) and correlated the data. We performed Western blot analysis on tumor cell lysates and carried out chromatin-immuno-precipitation (CHIP) after AR overexpression.RESULTS: We find that L1CAM is expressed preferentially though not exclusively in TNBCs. Using the human cancer genome atlas database and two independent breast cancer cohorts we find that L1CAM is inversely correlated with androgen receptor (AR) expression. We found that L1CAM(high)AR(low) primary breast tumors have the worst clinical outcome. Overexpression of AR in MDA-MB436 breast cancer cells decreased L1CAM expression at the protein and mRNA level and CHIP-analysis revealed binding of AR to the L1CAM promoter region.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that L1CAM in breast cancer is under AR control. The data also strongly advocate the use of L1CAM assessment in breast cancer diagnosis. We suggest that L1CAM expression could be causally related to the bad prognosis of TNBCs.}

Moreover, we aimed to assess the expression of transcripts that are specific for cancer stem cells (AdnaTest StemCell) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CTCs (AdnaTest EMT), as well as additional genes that are known to promote prostate cancer progression.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, we included 81 patients who underwent treatment for prostate cancer between 07/2014 and 02/2015, including: Group A, 18 patients (22.2{\%}) with low-risk clinically localised prostate cancer; Group B, 25 patients (30.9{\%}) with high-risk clinically localised prostate cancer; Group C, 11 patients (13.6{\%}) with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC); and Group D, 27 patients (33.3{\%}) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). AdnaTest ProstateCancer and AdnaTest StemCell/EMT were performed in all cases. In addition, expression of the androgen receptor (AR), c-met, c-kit and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) in CTCs was assessed using specific polymerase chain reaction assays.RESULTS: A positive AdnaTest ProstateCancer was present in three (16.7{\%}), two (8.0{\%}), six (54.5{\%}) and 19 (70.5{\%}) patients in groups A, B, C and D, respectively (P < 0.01, chi-squared test). The AdnaTest EMT and AdnaTest StemCell were positive in zero (0.0{\%}), zero (0.0{\%}), one (9.1{\%}), and two (7.4{\%}); and in five (27.8{\%}), four (16.0{\%}), three (27.3{\%}), and 11 (40.7{\%}) patients in groups A, B, C and D, respectively, with no significant differences noted between groups. CTCs expressing TYMS (44.4{\%} and 50.0{\%} vs 13.9{\%}) or AR (18.2{\%} and 25.9{\%} vs 0.0{\%}) were seen more commonly in patients in groups C and D vs patients with non-metastatic disease (all P < 0.05). Expression of c-kit and c-met were rare events, with only two patients positive for either marker.CONCLUSIONS: AdnaTest ProstateCancerDetect exhibits positive results mainly in patients with metastatic disease. Expression of AR and TYMS are frequent events in CTCs of patients with advanced disease, whereas c-met and c-kit gene expression is seen in only a small proportion of patients. The implications of these results for the use of CTC analysis as a decision factor for personalised treatment strategies in advanced prostate cancer remain to be determined.}

 abstract     = {Human spermatozoa express type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1), whose activation by anandamide (AEA) affects motility and acrosome reaction (AR). In this study, we extended the characterization of the AEA-related endocannabinoid system in human spermatozoa, and we focused on the involvement of the AEA-binding vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) in their fertilizing ability. Protein expression was revealed for CB1 ( approximately 56 kDa), TRPV1 ( approximately 95 kDa), AEA-synthesizing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) ( approximately 46 kDa), and AEA-hydrolyzing enzyme [fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), approximately 66 kDa]. Both AEA-binding receptors (CB1 and TRPV1) exhibited a functional binding activity; enzymatic activity was demonstrated for NAPE-PLD, FAAH, and the purported endocannabinoid membrane transporter (EMT). Immunoreactivity for CB1, NAPE-PLD, and FAAH was localized in the postacrosomal region and in the midpiece, whereas for TRPV1, it was restricted to the postacrosomal region. Capsazepine (CPZ), a selective antagonist of TRPV1, inhibited progesterone (P)-enhanced sperm/oocyte fusion, as evaluated by the hamster egg penetration test. This inhibition was due to a reduction of the P-induced AR rate above the spontaneous AR rate, which was instead increased. The sperm exposure to OMDM-1, a specific inhibitor of EMT, prevented the promoting effect of CPZ on spontaneous AR rate and restored the sperm responsiveness to P. No significant effects could be observed on sperm motility. In conclusion, this study provides unprecedented evidence that human spermatozoa exhibit a completely functional endocannabinoid system related to AEA and that the AEA-binding TRPV1 receptor could be involved in the sperm fertilizing ability.}

Soldiers who suffered from acute radiation sick-ness (ARS) in 1961 (n = 34), participants in the liquidation of the consequences of the Chornobyl catastrophe(PLCChC) 15 years after participating in the elimination of its consequences and in a later period (respectivelyPLCChC 1st group (n = 59) and the 2nd group (n = 337)). Soldiers are participants in the anti-terrorist operation(ATO)/Combined Forces (CFO) operation who did not receive modern combat injuries with blood loss (participants inthe ATO/CFO, n = 183). All servicemen did not have any diseases limiting their fitness capabilities for military serv-ice before being exposed to extreme factors of military service. A cumulative CIRS scale was used to comprehensive-ly assess comorbidity.RESULTS: With increasing time after participation in the elimination of the consequences of radiation accidents, thecourse of arterial hypertension (AH) is aggravated, but the dose-dependence of the severity of AH on the receivedradiation dose has not been established. The easier course of hypertension in ATO/CFO servicemen compared to ARSremote servicemen and group 2 PLCChC servicemen can be explained by their younger age at the time of the surveyand less time after exposure to extreme military service factors. In the military in the remote period after exposureto a complex of factors of radiation accidents, the frequency of diagnosing diseases by individual organs and bodysystem increases comparing to non-irradiated servicemen. The total number of disease severity scores on the cumu-lative scale of CIRS diseases is also higher. However, a dose-dependent effect of the severity of comorbid patholo-gy was also not found. These data indicate a higher prevalence of comorbid pathology in servicemen affected by acomplex of factors of radiation accf5idents, compared with participants in the anti-terrorist operation / environ-mental protection. However, the lower severity of comorbid pathology in ATO/CFO participants can also be explainedby their younger age at the time of the survey and less time after exposure to extreme factors of military service.CONCLUSIONS: For servicemen, with increasing time after participation in the elimination of the consequences ofradiation accidents, the course of hypertension without its dose dependence becomes more difficult. The total num-ber of disease severity scores on the cumulative scale of CIRS diseases in servicemen in the remote period after participation in the elimination of the consequences of radiation accidents is higher than in non-irradiated service-men.

 abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer death in men, worldwide. Mortality is highly related to metastasis and hormone resistance, but the molecular underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have studied the presence and role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa, using both in vitro and in vivo models, thereby providing evidence that the stemness-mesenchymal axis seems to be a critical process related to relapse, metastasis and resistance. These are complex and related processes that involve a cooperative action of different cancer cell subpopulations, in which CSCs and mesenchymal cancer cells (MCCs) would be responsible for invading, colonizing pre-metastatic niches, initiating metastasis and an evading treatments response. Manipulating the stemness-EMT axis genes on the androgen receptor (AR) may shed some light on the effect of this axis on metastasis and castration resistance in PCa. It is suggested that the EMT gene SNAI2/Slug up regulates the stemness gene Sox2, and vice versa, inducing AR expression, promoting metastasis and castration resistance. This approach will provide new sight about the role of the stemness-mesenchymal axis in the metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa and their potential control, contributing to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic and castration-resistant PCa.}

Our data showed that C3aR and C5aR knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells using CCK-8, colony formation and transwell assays. Flow cytometry assay showed C3aR and C5aR knockdown induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in HCC cells. Moreover, we found down-regulation of C3aR/C5aR obviously down-regulated the expression of PCNA, Ki-67 and suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin) in HCC cells.

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) transmits its signal via two major Galpha-proteins, primarily Galphaq and Galphai. However, the precise mechanism underlying the functions of Galphas signal in prostate cancer cells is still unclear. We have previously identified that GV1001, a fragment of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase, functions as a biased GnRHR ligand to selectively stimulate the Galphas/cAMP pathway. Here, we tried to reveal the potential mechanisms of which GV1001-stimulated Galphas-cAMP signaling pathway reduces the migration and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa) cells.METHODS: The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes was measured by western-blotting and spheroid formation on ultra-low attachment plate was detected after GV1001 treatment. In vivo Spleen-liver metastasis mouse model was used to explore the inhibitory effect of GV1001 on metastatic ability of PCa and the transwell migration assay was performed to identify whether GV1001 had a suppressive effect on cell migration in vitro. In order to demonstrate the interaction between androgen receptor (AR) and YAP1, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed in LNCaP cells with and without GV1001 treatment.RESULTS: GV1001 inhibited expression of EMT-related genes and spheroid formation. GV1001 also suppressed in vivo spleen-liver metastasis of LNCaP cells as well as cell migration in vitro. GV1001 enhanced the phosphorylation of AR and transcription activity of androgen response element reporter gene through cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Moreover, GV1001 increased Ser-127 phosphorylation of YAP1 and its ubiquitination, and subsequently decreased the levels of AR-YAP1 binding in the promoter region of the CTGF gene. In contrast, both protein and mRNA levels of NKX3.1 known for tumor suppressor gene and AR-coregulator were upregulated by GV1001 in LNCaP cells. YAP1 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 significantly suppressed the migration ability of LNCaP cells, and GV1001 did not affect the cell migration of YAP1-deficient LNCaP cells. On the contrary, cell migration was more potentiated in LNCaP cells overexpressing YAP5SA, a constitutively active form of YAP1, which was not changed by GV1001 treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study reveals an essential role of AR-YAP1 in the regulation of PCa cell migration, and provides evidence that GV1001 could be a novel GnRHR ligand to inhibit metastasis of PCa via the Galphas/cAMP pathway.}

 abstract     = {Baseball pitching has been described as an anaerobic activity from a bioenergetics standpoint with short bouts of recovery. Depending on the physical conditioning and muscle fiber composition of the pitcher as well as the number of pitches thrown per inning and per game, there is the possibility of pitchers fatiguing during a game, which could lead to a decrease in pitching performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 3 recovery protocols: passive recovery, active recovery (AR), and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) on range of motion (ROM), heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and blood lactate concentration in baseball pitchers during a simulated game. Twenty-one Division I intercollegiate baseball pitchers (age = 20.4 {\textpm} 1.4 years; height = 185.9 {\textpm} 8.4 cm; weight = 86.5 {\textpm} 8.9 kg; percent body fat = 11.2 {\textpm} 2.6) volunteered to pitch 3 simulated 5-inning games, with a maximum of 70 fastballs thrown per game while wearing an HR monitor. Range of motion was measured pre, post, and 24 hours postpitching for shoulder internal and external rotation at 90{\textdegree} and elbow flexion and extension. Heart rate was recorded after each pitch and after every 30 seconds of the 6-minute recovery period. Rating of perceived exertion was recorded after the last pitch of each inning and after completing each 6-minute recovery period. Immediately after throwing the last pitch of each inning, postpitching blood lactate concentration (PPLa-) was measured. At the end of the 6-minute recovery period, before the next inning started, postrecovery blood lactate concentration (PRLa-) was measured. Pitchers were instructed to throw each pitch at or above 95{\%} of their best-pitched fastball. This was enforced to ensure that each pitcher was throwing close to maximal effort for all 3 simulated games. All data presented represent group mean values. Results revealed that the method of recovery protocol did not significantly influence ROM (p > 0.05); however, it did significantly influence blood lactate concentration (p < 0.001), HR (p < 0.001), and RPE (p = 0.01). Blood lactate concentration significantly decreased from postpitching to postrecovery in the EMS recovery condition (p < 0.001), but did not change for either the active (p = 0.04) or the passive (p = 0.684) recovery conditions. Rating of perceived exertion decreased from the postpitching to postrecovery in both the passive and EMS recovery methods (p < 0.001), but did not decrease for AR (p = 0.067). Heart rate decreased for all conditions from postpitching to postrecovery (p < 0.001). The use of EMS was the most effective method at reducing blood lactate concentration after 6 minutes of recovery during a simulated game (controlled setting). Although EMS significantly reduced blood lactate concentrations after recovery, blood lactate concentrations after pitching in the simulated games were never high enough to cause skeletal muscle fatigue and decrease pitching velocity. If a pitcher were to throw more than 14 pitches per inning, throw more total pitches than normal per game, and have blood lactate concentrations increase higher than in the simulated games in this study, the EMS recovery protocol may be beneficial to pitching performance by aiding recovery. This could potentially reduce some injuries associated with skeletal muscle fatigue during pitching, may allow a pitcher throw more pitches per game, and may reduce the number of days between pitching appearances.}

This was examined in vivo in Smad3 wild-type/knockout (WT/KO) mice and in vitro in tubular epithelial cells with knockdown of Smad2 or Smad3. Results revealed that chronic administration of aristolochic acid (AA) resulted in a severe AAN characterized by progressive renal dysfunction and tubulointerstitial fibrosis including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Smad3 WT mice, but not in Smad3 KO mice, suggesting a critical role for Smad3 in the development of AAN. This was further tested in vitro. We found that AA was able to activate Smad signaling to mediate EMT and renal fibrosis via both TGF-beta-dependent and JNK/MAP kinase-dependent mechanisms because blockade of JNK and specific knockdown of Smad3, but not Smad2, were able to attenuate AA-stimulated collagen matrix expression and EMT. In conclusion, TGF-beta/Smad3 may be an essential mediator for chronic AAN. Results from this study indicate that specific blockade of the TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling pathway may have therapeutic potential for chronic AAN.}

 abstract     = {17beta-Estradiol (E2) has been proven to exert protective effects against HCC; however, its mechanism on HCC proliferation and suppression of invasion remains to be further explored. Because HCC up-regulates serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), molecular agents that attenuate IL-6/STAT3 signaling can potentially suppress HCC development. In this study, we examined involvement of E2 in anoikis resistance that induces invasion capacities and chemo-resistance. Huh-BAT and HepG2 cells grown under anchorage-independent condition were selected. The anoikis-resistant (AR) cells showed stronger chemo-resistance against sorafenib, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin compared to adherent HCC cells. AR HCC cells exhibited decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of the N-cadherin and vimentin compared to adherent HCC cells. We then demonstrated that E2 suppressed cell proliferation in AR HCC cells. IL-6 treatment enhanced invasive characteristics, and E2 reversed it. Regarding mechanism of E2, it decreased in the phosphorylation of STAT3 that overexpressed on AR HCC cells. The inhibitory effect of E2 on cell growth was accompanied with cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and caspase-3/9/PARP activation through c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings suggested that E2 inhibited the proliferation of AR HCC cells through down-regulation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling. Thus, E2 can be a potential therapeutic drug for treatment of metastatic or chemo-resistant HCC.}

However, our knowledge is still fragmentary and there remain numerous questions regarding the mechanisms at play and the functional consequences of these interactions. We have recently established a mesenchymal-like prostate cancer cell line (22Rv1/CR-1; Mes-PCa). In this study, we assessed the effects of the extracellular vesicles released by these cells on recipient androgen-dependent epithelial VCaP prostate cancer cells. Mes-PCa derived vesicles were found to promote mesenchymal features in the recipient epithelial-like prostate cancer cells. This transformation was accompanied by a modulation of androgen receptor signaling and activation of TGFbeta signaling pathway. Moreover, recipient cells acquiring mesenchymal traits displayed enhanced migratory and invasive features as well as increased resistance to the androgen receptor antagonist, enzalutamide. Our results suggest a previously unappreciated role for Mes-PCa secreted vesicles in cancer promotion by transferring cell-mediated signals and promoting phenotypic changes in recipient prostate cancercells.}

 abstract     = {Somatic mutations in kinase genes are associated with sensitivity of solid tumors to kinase inhibitors, but patients with metastatic cancer eventually develop disease progression. In EGFR mutant lung cancer, modeling of acquired resistance (AR) with drug-sensitive cell lines has identified clinically relevant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance mechanisms such as the second-site mutation, EGFR T790M, amplification of the gene encoding an alternative kinase, MET, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The full spectrum of DNA changes associated with AR remains unknown. We used next-generation sequencing to characterize mutational changes associated with four populations of EGFR mutant drug-sensitive and five matched drug-resistant cell lines. Comparing resistant cells with parental counterparts, 18-91 coding SNVs/indels were predicted to be acquired and 1-27 were lost; few SNVs/indels were shared across resistant lines. Comparison of two related parental lines revealed no unique coding SNVs/indels, suggesting that changes in the resistant lines were due to drug selection. Surprisingly, we observed more CNV changes across all resistant lines, and the line with EMT displayed significantly higher levels of CNV changes than the other lines with AR. These results demonstrate a framework for studying the evolution of AR and provide the first genome-wide spectrum of mutations associated with the development of cellular drug resistance in an oncogene-addicted cancer. Collectively, the data suggest that CNV changes may play a larger role than previously appreciated in the acquisition of drug resistance and highlight that resistance may be heterogeneous in the context of different tumor cell backgrounds.}

A motion platform reproduced shocks and vibrations from ambulance and helicopter field rides, as well as more severe shocks and vibrations that might be encountered on rougher terrain and in inclement weather (designated as an "augmented" ride). Motion capture technology quantitated involuntary cervical rotation, flexion/extension, and lateral bend. The mean and 95{\%} confidence interval of the mean were calculated for the root mean square of angular changes from the starting position and for the maximum range of motion.RESULTS: All configurations tested decreased cervical rotation and flexion/extension relative to the cot alone. However, the LSB and VM were significantly more effective in decreasing cervical rotation than the cervical collar, and the LSB decreased rotation more than the VM in augmented rides. The LSB and VM, but not the cervical collar, significantly limited cervical lateral bend relative to the cot alone.CONCLUSION: Under the study conditions, the LSB and the VM were more effective in limiting cervical movement than the cervical collar. Under some conditions, the LSB decreased repetitive and acute movements more than the VM. Further studies using simulation and other approaches will be essential for determining the safest, most effective configuration should providers choose to immobilize patients with suspected spinal injuries.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.}

Expression of the ESR1 Y537S mutation induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with cells exhibiting enhanced migration and invasion potential in vitro. When small subpopulations of Y537S ESR1 mutant cells were injected along with WT parental cells, tumor growth was enhanced with mutant cells becoming the predominant population in distant metastases. Y537S mutant primary xenograft tumors were resistant to the antiestrogen tamoxifen (Tam) as well as to estradiol (E2) withdrawal. Y537S ESR1 mutant primary tumors metastasized efficiently in the absence of E2; however, Tam treatment significantly inhibited metastasis to distant sites. We identified a nine-gene expression signature, which predicted clinical outcomes of ER-positive breast cancer patients, as well as breast cancer metastasis to the lung. Androgen receptor (AR) protein levels were increased in mutant models, and the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone significantly inhibited estrogen-regulated gene expression, EMT, and distant metastasis in vivo, suggesting that AR may play a role in distant metastatic progression of ESR1 mutant tumors.}

We analysed the clinical data of the patients, including hormone levels, AR gene variants, and functional domains.RESULTS: Variants occurred in the 3 major functional domains in 56 patients, including 23 patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) and 33 with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS). The incidence of nonscrotal fusion (P=0.019) and proximal urethral opening (P=0.0002) in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) group was higher than that in the non-LBD group. The phallus length in the LBD group was significantly shorter than that in the non-LBD group (P=0.009). The external masculinization score (EMS) in the LBD group was significantly lower than that in the non-LBD group (P=0.013). The levels of inhibin-B (INHB; P=0.0007), basal luteinizing hormone (LH; P=0.033), LH peak (P=0.002), and testosterone (T) after human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) stimulation (P=0.001) in the LBD group were higher than those in the non-LBD group.

The phallus length was shorter, and the incidences of proximal urethral opening and nonscrotal fusion were higher, suggesting that the phenotypes in the LBD group were more severe. The levels of INHB, basal LH, peak LH, and T after HCG stimulation in the LBD group were higher than those in the non-LBD group, suggesting that androgen resistance in the LBD group was more severe.

More effective therapies must be developed and tested in well-controlled, randomized, prospective studies with a direct comparison to current standards.OBJECTIVES: The aim of these studies was to investigate the efficacy of MP29-02 (a novel formulation of azelastine and fluticasone propionate [FP]) in patients with moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and to compare its efficacy with 2 first-line therapies (ie, intranasal azelastine and intranasal FP) in this population.METHODS: Three thousand three hundred ninety-eight patients (≥12 years old) with moderate-to-severe SAR were enrolled into 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group trials (MP4002 [NCT00651118], MP4004 [NCT00740792], and MP4006 [NCT00883168]). Each trial was conducted for 14 days during different allergy seasons. The primary efficacy variable was the sum of the morning and evening change from baseline in reflective total nasal symptom score (range, 0-24) over the treatment period. Outcomes for the meta-analysis included efficacy according to disease severity and time to response in relevant responder criteria.RESULTS: In the meta-analysis MP29-02 reduced the mean reflective total nasal symptom score from baseline (-5.7 [SD, 5.3]) more than FP (-5.1 [SD, 4.9], P< .001), azelastine (-4.4 [SD,4.8], P< .001), or placebo (-3.0 [SD, 4.2], P< .001). This benefit was observed from the first day of assessment, with improvement in each individual nasal symptom, even in the patients with the most severe disease. MP29-02 achieved response consistently days earlier and showed greater efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe rhinitis than FP and azelastine.CONCLUSIONS: MP29-02 represents a novel therapy that demonstrated superiority to 2 first-line therapies for AR. Patients with moderate-to-severe SAR achieved better control, and their symptoms were controlled earlier with MP29-02 than with recommended medications according to guidelines.}

RE changes were calculated, using different protocols of statistics.RESULTS: We demonstrated differences in RE of seven genes between tumors and CNT, as was calculated, using the 2-DeltaCT model and the Wilcoxon matched paired test. Five genes (ESR1, KRT18, MKI67, MMP9, PCA3) showed altered expression in adenocarcinomas, in which the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion was detected. Two genes (INSR, isoform B and HOTAIR) expressed differently in tumors without fusion. Comparison of the gene expression pattern in adenomas, CNT and adenocarcinomas demonstrated that in adenocarcinomas, bearing the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion, genes KRT18, PCA3, and SCHLAP1expressed differently. At the same time, we detected differences in RE of AR (isoform2), MMP9, PRLR and HOTAIR in adenocarcinomas without the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion. Two genes (ESR1and SRD5A2) showed differences in RE in both adenocarcinoma groups. Fourteen genes, namely AR (isoforms 1and 2), CDH1, OCLN, NKX3-1, XIAP, GCR (ins AG), INSR (isoform A), IGF1R, IGF1R tr, PRLR, PRL, VDR and SRD5A2showed correlation between RE and tumor stage. RE of four genes (CDH2, ESR2, VDR and SRD5A2) correlated with differentiation status of tumors (Gleason score). Using the K-means clustering, we could cluster adenocarcinomas in three groups, according to gene expression profiles. A specific subtype of prostate tumors is characterized by the activated ERG signaling, due to the presence of TMPRSS2/ERG fusion, and also by high levels of the androgen receptor, prolactin, IGF, INSR and PCA3.CONCLUSIONS: We have found the specific differences in expression of the steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes, depending on the pre-sence/absence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion in prostate adenocarcinomas, CNT and adenomas. We showed three different gene expression profiles of prostate adenocarcinomas. One of them is characteristic for adenocarcinomas with the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion. Further experiments are needed to confirm these data in a larger cohort of patients.}

Knockdown (KD) of AR in these cells did not affect the expression of either CD44 or SOX2. Conversely, PC3 cells, which are negative for AR, expressed both CD44 and SOX2. However, the expression of AR downregulated the expression of both CD44 and SOX2 in PC3 cells. CD44 regulates SOX2 expression as KD of CD44 and reduces SOX2 levels considerably. SOX2 KD attenuated not only the expression of SNAIL and SLUG but also the migration and tumorsphere formation in PC3 cells. Collectively, our findings underscore a novel role of CD44 signaling in the maintenance of stemness and progression of cancer through SOX2 in AR-independent PC3 cells. SOX2 has a role in the regulation of expression of SNAIL and SLUG. SOX2 could be a potential therapeutic target to thwart the progression of SOX2-positive cancer cells or recurrence of androgen-independent PCa.}

 abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PC) remains a widespread malignancy in men. Since the androgen/androgen receptor (AR) axis is associated with the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, suppression of AR-dependent signaling by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) still represents the primary intervention for this disease. Despite the initial response, prostate cancer frequently develops resistance to ADT and progresses. As such, the disease becomes metastatic and few therapeutic options are available at this stage. Although the majority of studies are focused on the role of AR signaling, compelling evidence has shown that estrogens and their receptors control prostate cancer initiation and progression through a still debated mechanism. Epithelial versus mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in metastatic spread as well as drug-resistance of human cancers, and many studies on the role of this process in prostate cancer progression have been reported. We discuss here the findings on the role of estrogen/estrogen receptor (ER) axis in epithelial versus mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells. The pending questions concerning this issue are presented, together with the impact of the available data in clinical management of prostate cancer patients.}

 abstract     = {Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates a number of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is upregulated in prostate cancer. Androgen regulation of Twist1 has been reported in a previous study. However, the mechanism of androgen regulation of the Twist1 gene is not understood because the Twist1 promoter lacks androgen receptor (AR)-responsive elements. Previous studies have shown that the Twist1 promoter has putative binding sites for PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors. Our lab has previously identified Ets Variant 1 (ETV1), a member of the PEA3 subfamily, as a novel androgen-regulated gene that is involved in prostate cancer cell invasion through unknown mechanism. In view of these data, we hypothesized that androgen-activated AR upregulates Twist1 gene expression via ETV1. Our data confirmed the published work that androgen positively regulates Twist1 gene expression and further showed that this positive effect was directed at the Twist1 promoter. The positive effect of androgen on Twist1 gene expression was abrogated upon disruption of AR expression by siRNA or of AR activity by Casodex. More importantly, our data show that disruption of ETV1 leads to significant decrease in both androgen-mediated upregulation as well as basal level of Twist1, which we are able to rescue upon re-expression of ETV1. Indeed, we are able to show that ETV1 mediates the androgen upregulation of Twist1 by acting on the proximal region of Twist1 promoter. Additionally, our data show that Twist1 regulates prostate cancer cell invasion and EMT, providing a possible mechanism by which ETV1 mediates prostate cancer cell invasion. In conclusion, in this study we report Twist1 as an indirect target of AR and androgen regulation through ETV1.}

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) activity and underling mechanisms of EGCG in testosterone-induced BPH rats and in BPH-1 cells. Prostatic levels of oxidative stress and inflammation makers, as well as angiogenesis related growth factors were measured. Additionally, the prostatic levels of sex hormonal mediators (androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), type I TGF-beta receptor (TGF-betaRI), Smad3, phosphorylation-Smad3 (p-Smad3), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, collagen-I, fibronectin and alpha-SMA) and microRNA (miR)-133a/b were analyzed by immunohistochemistry assay, western blot and/or quantitative RT-PCR. It was observed that EGCG attenuated the prostatic oxidative stress and inflammatory microenvironment, ameliorated prostatic hyperplasia and collagen deposition, reduced the levels of angiogenesis related growth factors, inhibited the over-expression of AR, ER-alpha, HIF-1alpha, TGF-beta1, TGF-betaRI and p-Smad3, enhanced the expression of ER-beta, increased the levels of miR-133a/b, as well as relieved prostatic EMT in rats. Both HIF-1alpha inhibitor and EGCG decreased the expression of HIF-1alpha and TGF-beta1, as well as attenuated EMT in BPH-1 cells. It indicated that EGCG could attenuate testosterone-induced BPH and fibrosis.}

Oral and rectal measurements were taken with the IVAC 2080A electronic thermometer, and the Genius thermometer was used in the oral equivalent mode. All instruments were calibrated. Of the 332 patients entered into the study, 51 had oral or tympanic temperatures > or = 100.0 degrees F. Forty-one of these patients consented to a rectal temperature measurement. The correlation (r) between tympanic and oral, tympanic and rectal, and oral and rectal temperature was .845, .853, and .940, respectively. The oral thermometer identified all 28 febrile patients (rectal temperature > or = 100.4 degrees F). However, the tympanic thermometer detected fever in only 19 of these cases. Two patients in whom the tympanic thermometer failed to detect fever had AIDS, and their workup was altered by the detection of the fever. We conclude that the tympanic thermometer is not as sensitive as the oral thermometer in the detection of fever. The use of tympanic thermometers in the adult emergency department should be questioned.}

The purpose of this study is to analyze the background of the formation of Arabic grammar at the beginning and the mutual influence among Islamic studies on it such as Islamic jurisprudence. It means that Arabic grammar has been closely related to the other Islamic studies. This is manifested by the fact that all the Islamic studies has primarily been conducted on the basis of the Quran.As for the formation of Arabic grammar, its direct motive is attributed to the conservation and more correct understanding of the Quran. Considering that the Quran provides an absolute standard governing all aspects of Muslim's life, it was an influential factor in the formation of all the Islamic studies. In this context, it's noteworthy of focusing on how Arabic grammar has induced its consistent rules from the other Islamic studies, especially Islamic jurisprudence. and the law enforcement ability from the Quran and Sunnah, the source of legal evidence. The methodology of Islamic jurisprudence can be divided into two main categories. First, a descriptive method of gathering and classifying passages related to the principle and enforcement ability of Islamic law.Secondly, a speculative method of extracting specific legal regulations from the Quran to apply it to reality.The derivation of specific legal provisions from the categorized data was done through a rational method of so-called analogy(qiyas). The analogy is a rational reasoning that creates new things from existing knowldege. Jurists generally established the basic rules of law by the agreement, and when it became difficult, they solved the problem by the analogy. The analogy of Islamic law consists of four stages: the original 'aṣl, the lower far', the cause 'illah, and the judgment ḥukm. The original 'aṣl is a basic rule as a prototype, and the lower far'a is a modified rule obtained by expanding the basic rule. The cause 'illah, refers to a cause or reason that allows the expansion process to be extended when a basic rule is extended and a sub-rule is derived.The analogy has greatly contributed to the systematization and diversification of the grammatical studies as stated clearly in Sibawayhi and Ibn Jini's researches. In addition, the grammatical research was developed by dividing the structure of words and sentences into the original 'aṣl and the lower far'a and establishing the causal factors 'illah which are the logical proof of the modification. The early analogy was a natural analogy, but it was affected by medieval speculative theology and expanded into the speculative and rational analogy. As a result of this, many problems have occurred due to the conflicting and diversified opinions among the grammatical scholars about the causal factors.}

After obtaining de novo Food and Drug Administration clearance, over 200 systems are deployed in all Marine battalion aid stations around the world. Infrascanner, a handheld brain hematoma detection system, is based on the differential near-infrared light absorption of the injured versus the noninjured part of brain. About 12 independent studies have been conducted in the USA, Canada, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Poland, Afghanistan, India, China, and Turkey. Here, we outline the background and design of the device as well as clinical studies with a total of 1293 patients and 203 hematomas. Infrascanner demonstrates high sensitivity (adults: 92.5{\%} and children: 93{\%}) and specificity (adults: 82.9{\%} and children: 86.5{\%}) in detecting intracranial hematomas >3.5mL in volume and <2.5cm from the surface of the brain.

The two-chip microsystem consists of a MEMS chip for sensing the external acceleration and a CMOS chip for signal processing. An optimized design method to determine the device thickness, the sacrificial gap, and the vertical gap length of the M EMS sensing element is applied to minimize the fundamental noise level and also to achieve the robustness to the fabrication variations. In order to cancel out the offset and gain variations due to parasitic capacitances and process variations, a digitally trimmable architecture consisting of an 11 bit capacitor array is adopted in the analog front-end of the CMOS capacitive readout circuit. The out-of-plane microaccelerometer has the scale factor of 372 mV/g389 mV/g, the output nonlinearity of 0.43{\%} FSO0.60{\%} FSO, the input range of {\textpm}2 g and a bias instability of 122 mug229 mug. The signal-to-noise ratio and the noise equivalent resolution are measured to be 74.00 dB75.23 dB and 180 mug/rtHz190 mug/rtHz, respectively. The in-plane cross-axis sensitivities are measured to be 1.1{\%}1.9{\%} and 0.3{\%}0.7{\%} of the out-of-plane sensitivity, respectively.

The current standard scale, the Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA), takes a mean ({\textpm}SD) of 5 minutes to complete, requiring 30 minutes of nursing time per patient when multiple measures are required.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to assess the feasibility and reliability of a brief scale of alcohol withdrawal severity.METHODS: The SHOT is a brief scale designed to assess alcohol withdrawal in the emergency department (ED). It includes four items: sweating, hallucinations, orientation, and tremor (SHOT). It was developed based on a literature review and a consensus process by emergency and addiction physicians. The SHOT was first piloted in one ED, and then a prospective observational study was conducted at a different ED to measure its feasibility and reliability. Subjects included patients who were in alcohol withdrawal. One nurse administered the SHOT and CIWA, and the physician repeated the SHOT independently. The SHOT was done only at baseline, before treatment was administered.RESULTS: In the pilot study (12 patients), the SHOT took 1 minute to complete on average, and the CIWA took 5 minutes. Sixty-one patients participated in the prospective study. For the SHOT and the CIWA done by the same nurse, the kappa was 0.88 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 1.0; p < 0.0001), and the Pearson's r was 0.71 (p < 0.001). The kappa for the nurse's CIWA score and the physician's SHOT score was 0.61 (95{\%} CI = 0.25 to 0.97; p < 0.0006), and the Pearson's r was 0.48 (p = 0.002). The SHOTs performed by the nurse and physician agreed on the need for benzodiazepine treatment in 30 of 37 cases (82{\%} agreement, kappa = 0.35, 95{\%} CI = 0.03 to 0.67; p < 0.02). The mean ({\textpm}SD) time taken by nurses and physicians to complete the SHOT was 1 ({\textpm} 0.52) minute (median = 0.6 minutes). Seventeen percent of patients scored positive on the SHOT for hallucinations or disorientation.CONCLUSIONS: The SHOT has potential as a feasible and acceptable tool for measuring pretreatment alcohol withdrawal severity in the ED. Further research is needed to validate the SHOT, to assess the utility of serial measurements of the SHOT, and to demonstrate that its use reduces length of stay and improves clinical outcomes.}

To establish an androgen-stimulated differentiation in AR-negative BPH-1, we generated AR-transduced BPH-1 cells, which displayed androgen-induced secretory differentiation and growth suppression in 3D culture. We also evaluated the spheroid forming capacity of tumorigenic derivative BPH-1(CAFTD) sublines in 3D culture and their responses to PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Results showed that these tumorigenic BPH-1(CAFTD) sublines did not exhibit polarized differentiation in Matrigel culture. Interestingly, polarization could be restored by LY294002 treatment of BPH-1(CAFTD1) but not of BPH-1(CAFTD3) subline. Finally, we employed this 3D culture model to examine the significance of an EMT-regulatory transcription factor Snail in prostate cancer development by its stable transduction into BPH-1 cells. Results showed that BPH-1-Snail cells lost their spheroid forming capacity and exhibited an invasive phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we established a 3D culture model of human prostatic epithelial cells with structural and functional relevance to normal prostate gland and prostate cancer development and also demonstrated that this 3D model might be useful to assess the ability of drugs to restore differentiation as a potential surrogate measure of efficacy for prostate cancer therapy.}

We have demonstrated previously that a DR1-specific, human renal allograft-derived T cell line and replicate, anti-DR1 mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), established from an unrelated responder/stimulator pair, were selected for T cells expressing V beta 8. In this report V beta 8+ beta-chains from these T cell lines were sequenced to assess clonality and determine the contribution made by the beta-chain junctional regions. All 11 V beta 8+ cDNA clones sequenced from the allograft-derived T cell lines used J beta 2.7 and C beta 2 and had identical junctions, indicating the presence of a predominant V beta 8+ clone. All seven V beta 8+ sequences from the first anti-DR1 MLR and eight of the nine fron the second also used J beta 2.7 and C beta 2 were identical to one another, indicating that a common V beta 8+ clone was selected in these replicate cultures. The sequences of the predominant V beta 8+ beta-chains from the allograft-derived T-cell line and the MLR differed by only 10 nucleotides and four amino acids at the VDJ beta junction. To determine the reproducibility of TCR V beta selection in responses to DR1, additional MLR were established by pairing three different DR1+ stimulators with the same responder. The TCR repertoires of the resulting DR1-specific cell lines were examined. A preference was seen for utilization for certain homologous TCR V beta segments. The data suggest that particular TCR V beta or V beta/J beta combinations may be selected in alloresponses as evidenced either utilization of highly similar beta-chains or homologous V beta segments.}

 abstract     = {VNLG-152 is a novel retinamide (NR) shown to suppress growth and progression of genetically diverse prostate cancer cells via inhibition of androgen receptor signaling and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) translational machinery. Herein, we report therapeutic effects of VNLG-152 on castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth and metastatic phenotype in a CRPC tumor xenograft model. Administration of VNLG-152 significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the growth of aggressive CWR22Rv1 tumors by 63.4{\%} and 76.3{\%} at 10 and 20mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 bw, respectively (P<0.0001), vs. vehicle with no host toxicity. Strikingly, the expression of full-length androgen receptor (f-AR)/androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7), mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1/2), phosphorylated eIF4E and their associated target proteins, including prostate-specific antigen, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, were strongly decreased in VNLG-152-treated tumors signifying inhibition of f-AR/AR-V7 and MNK-eIF4E signaling in VNLG-152-treated CWR22Rv1 tumors as observed invitro. VNLG-152 also suppressed the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in CWR22Rv1 tumors as evidenced by repression of N-cadherin, beta-catenin, claudin, Slug, Snail, Twist, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) with upsurge in E-cadherin. These results highlight the promising use of VNLG-152 in CRPC therapy and justify its further development towards clinical trials.}

Athlete external load measures across a competitive season in high school basketball. J Strength Cond Res 37(11): 2206-2212, 2023-The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to quantify in-season external load and to determine if relationships existed between load metrics and basketball performance. Eleven male high school varsity basketball athletes (n = 11; mass 80.5 {\textpm} 9.6 kg, height 190.2 {\textpm} 9.4 cm, age 17.6 {\textpm} 0.7 years) were monitored across a season. PlayerLoad (PL), PL per minute (PL{\textperiodcentered}min -1 ), total jumps, and explosive movements (EMs) were quantified using a commercially available local positioning unit. Basketball-specific performance metrics, including points scored, points allowed, point differentials, and shooting percentages for each quarter and game, were compiled. Data were analyzed using repeated-measure analysis of variance to evaluate differences in load by starting status, session type, game outcome, and game type. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess relationships between load metrics and basketball performance. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The mean values across 23 games for PL, PL{\textperiodcentered}min -1 , total jumps, and EMs were 457 {\textpm} 104 AU, 10.9 {\textpm} 1.6 AU, 42.6 {\textpm} 9.6, and 46.7 {\textpm} 7.2, respectively. Relationships were observed ( p < 0.05) between PL and points scored ( r = 0.38) and free throw percentage ( r = 0.21). Further relationships were observed between PL{\textperiodcentered}min -1 and free throw shooting percentage ( r = -0.27), and between points scored and total jumps ( r = 0.28), and EMs ( r = 0.26). Notable differences in game demands were observed for playing status. Meaningful differences in measures of external load were observed between each quarter of play, with the highest measures evident in quarters 1 and 3. Guards and forwards experienced minimal differences in external load during gameplay, and game outcome did not result in differences. Higher point totals corresponded with higher PL, total jumps, and EM.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: We report the utilisation and impact of a novel triage-based electronic screening tool (eST) combined with clinical assessment to recognise sepsis in paediatric ED.METHODS: An electronic sepsis screening tool was implemented in the paediatric EDs of two large UK secondary care hospitals between June 2018 and January 2019. Patients eligible for screening were children < 16 years of ages excluding those with minor injuries or who were brought directly to resuscitation. Subsequently, a retrospective evaluation was performed to determine the performance of the tool alone and in combination with clinical assessment after triage, to identify septic patients, using sensitivity, specificity, positive, negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) and likelihood ratios.RESULTS: 19 912 children were triaged during the study period, of whom 90 (0.45{\%}) were classified as having sepsis. 99{\%} of all eligible patients were screened. The eST alerted for 2651 (13.3{\%}) patients. After immediate physician assessment, 151 were treated for sepsis in the ED, of whom 70 had a final diagnosis of sepsis. Eight patients who were not thought to be septic returned with sepsis within 24 hours. The eST showed a sensitivity of 86.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 77.5{\%} to 92.6{\%}), specificity 87.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 86.5{\%} to 87.5{\%}), PPV 2.94{\%} (95{\%} CI 2.35{\%} to 3.68{\%}), NPV 99.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 99.8{\%} to 99.9{\%}) which improved with combined clinical assessment to a sensitivity of 90.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 81.4{\%} to 95.0{\%}), specificity 99.4 (95{\%} CI 99.3{\%} to 99.5{\%}), PPV 42.0 (95{\%} CI 35.0{\%} to 49.3{\%}) and NPV 99.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 99.9{\%} to 99.9{\%}).CONCLUSION: Utilisation of a novel triage-based eST allowed sepsis screening in over 99{\%} of eligible patients. The screening tool showed good accuracy to recognise sepsis at triage in the ED, which was augmented further by combining it with clinician assessment. The screening tool requires further refinement through multicentre evaluation to avoid missing sepsis cases.}

 abstract     = {Studies demonstrate that inflammation synergizes with high-grade aggressive prostate tumor development and ultimately metastatic spread, in which a lot of work has been done in recent years. However, the clear mechanism of inflammation inciting prostate cancer remains largely uncharacterized. Our previous study has shown that the conditioned media (CM)-mediated LNCaP cell migration is partially correlated with the loss of expression of the tumor suppressor NKX3.1. Here, we continue to investigate the inflammation-mediated migration of prostate cancer cells, and the role of NKX3.1 in this process to gain insights into cell migration-related changes comprehensively. Earlier, the model of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment have been optimized by our research group; here, we continue to investigate the time-dependent effect of CM exposure together with NKX3.1 changes, in which we observed that these changes play important roles in gaining heterogeneous epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Hence, this is an important parameter of tumor progression; we depleted NKX3.1 expression using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and examined the migrating cell clusters after exposure to inflammatory cytokines. We found that the migrated cells clearly demonstrate reversible loss of E-cadherin expression, which is consistent with subsequent vimentin expression alterations in comparison to control cells. Moreover, the data suggest that the AR-mediated transcriptional program also contributes to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, the quantitative proteomic analysis showed that migrated subpopulations from the same cell line presented different phenotypes in which the proteins overexpressed are involved in cell metabolism and RNA processing. According to KEGG pathway analysis, the ABC transporters were found to be the most significant. Thus, the dynamic process of cellular migration favors diverse genetic compositions under changing tumor microenvironments. The different levels of invasiveness are supported by shifting the cells in between these EMT and MET phenotypes.}

Neferine is a dibenzyl isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Nelumbo nucifera and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-prostate cancer effects. The beneficial therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of neferine in BPH remain unclear. A mouse model of BPH was generated by subcutaneous injection of 7.5mg/kg testosterone propionate (TP) and 2 or 5mg/kg neferine was given orally for 14 or 28days. Pathological and morphological characteristics were evaluated. Prostate weight, prostate index (prostate/body weight ratio), expression of type Ⅱ 5alpha-reductase, androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen were all decreased in prostate tissue of BPH mice after administration of neferine. Neferine also downregulated the expression of pro-caspase-3, uncleaved PARP, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta receptor Ⅱ (TGFBR2), p-Smad2/3, N-cadherin and vimentin. Expression of E-cadherin, cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 was increased by neferine treatment. 1-100muM neferine with 1muM testosterone or 10nM TGF-beta1 were added to the culture medium of the normal human prostate stroma cell line, WPMY-1, for 24h or 48h. Neferine inhibited cell growth and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in testosterone-treated WPMY-1 cells and regulated the expression of androgen signaling pathway proteins and those related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, TGF-beta1, TGFBR2 and p-Smad2/3, N-cadherin and vimentin expression were increased but E-cadherin was decreased after 24h TGF-beta1 treatment in WPMY-1 cells. Neferine reversed the effects of TGF-beta1 treatment in WPMY-1 cells. Neferine appeared to suppress prostate growth by regulating the EMT, AR and TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathways in the prostate and is suggested as a potential agent for BPH treatment.}

However, most tumors progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after ADT. We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen-binding protein transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of TGFBI ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis and can be caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.}

State-level criminal histories of patients with serious mental illnesses were analyzed to determine the proportion who had been arrested and number of lifetime arrests and charges, associations of six variables with number of arrests, and the most common charges from individuals first two arrests and most recent two arrests.Methods: A total of 240 patients were recruited at three inpatient psychiatric facilities and gave consent to access their criminal history. Information was extracted from Record of Arrest and Prosecution (RAP) sheets for lifetime arrests in Georgia.Results: A total of 171 (71{\%}) had been arrested. Their mean{\textpm}SD lifetime arrests were 8.6{\textpm}10.1, and mean lifetime charges were 12.6{\textpm}14.6. In a Poisson regression, number of arrests was associated with lower educational attainment, Black or African American race, the presence of a substance use disorder, the presence of a mood disorder, and female sex. Common early charges included marijuana possession, driving under the influence of alcohol, and burglary and shoplifting. Common recent charges included probation violations, failure to appear in court, officer obstruction-related charges, and disorderly conduct.Conclusions: Findings point to a need for policy and program development in the legal system (e.g., pertaining to charges such as willful obstruction of an officer), the mental health community (e.g., to ensure that professionals know about clients legal involvement and can partner in strategies to reduce arrests), and social services sectors (to address charges, such as shoplifting, often related to material disadvantage).}

 abstract     = {It has been shown that the Chinese hamster cell mutant V-C8 is sensitive to different DNA damaging agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC), alkylating agents, UV light, and X-rays. We found that V-C8 is also sensitive to the following radiomimetic agents: bleomycin (approximately 2-fold, based on D10 values), H2O2 (approximately 2-fold), streptonigrin (approximately 11-fold), and etoposide (approximately 8-fold). Two independent spontaneous MMC-resistant revertants isolated from V-C8 cells show a level of cell killing by X-rays, EMS, and UV light which is similar to that of wild-type cells, suggesting that the observed pattern of cross-sensitivity of V-C8 cells to a wide spectrum of DNA damaging agents results from a single mutation. V-C8 cells also display radioresistant DNA synthesis following gamma-irradiation which, however, remained almost unchanged in the V-C8 revertants. The measurement of the level and rate of repair of DNA single- and double-strand breaks (SSBs and DSBs, respectively) by the DNA elution technique showed that the V-C8 mutant has a slower repair of DSBs induced by gamma-rays. The described unique phenotype of V-C8 cells suggested that V-C8 represents a novel type of mutant amongst X-ray-sensitive hamster cell mutants. To confirm this, complementation analysis with other X-ray-sensitive mutants was performed. V-C8 cells were fused with EM9, XR-1, xrs5, sxi-1, V-3, V-E5, irs3, and BLM2 mutant cells, representing different complementation groups. All the obtained hybrids regained X-ray resistance (or bleomycin resistance in the case of V-C8/BLM2 hybrids) similar to that of wild-type cells, indicating that V-C8 represents a new complementation group. The results presented indicate that V-C8 is defective in a gene involved in a pathway operating in the responses to different DNA damaging agents in mammalian cells.}

In a 2*2*2 between-subjects factorial design with 213 participants, the level of threat evoked by a traditional PSA, by the interactive part of the PSA (dedicated advertising location or DAL) and by the preceding program context are manipulated to be either low or high. The results support the assumptions of the Extended Parallel Processing Model with regard to the effect of the level of perceived threat and perceived efficacy in an interactive media environment, and the important role of telepresence as a processing variable. The results of the three-way interaction effect of threat evoked by the program, the PSA and the DAL on telepresence show that when the threat levels of the program and the PSA are both either low or high, exposure to the threatening information in the DAL does not generate a significantly higher feeling of telepresence. However, when a low-threat program is followed by a high-threat PSA, the threat level of the DAL has a positive effect on telepresence. The same trend is found with a high-threat program and a low-threat PSA, although the effect of the threat evoked by the DAL on telepresence is not significant at conventional levels. Finally, there is a positive effect of telepresence on the behavioral intention to reduce speeding, which is partly mediated by the viewer's perceived efficacy to follow the recommended behavior.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: There is no established costing model for operating theatres (OTs) in South Africa (SA), yet both health sectors have existing charges for OT time: in the state sector, Uniform Patient Fee Schedule (UPFS) rates, and in the private sector, rands per minute (ZAR/min) rates. Understanding the cost of providing the separate components of a health service is important for planning and funding purposes.OBJECTIVES: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To develop a costing model that would allow calculation of the ZAR/min cost of OT time.SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the actual costs, in order to establish the comparable costs that would be included in the ZAR/min charges for OTs in the private health sector.METHODS: The OTs in a secondary-level, state sector hospital in Cape Town were used in this quantitative observational study to develop a top-down costing model for OTs in SA. The inclusive costing model was developed in a consultative process with professionals, managers and experts from the state and private sectors. The model was then populated with costs for the month of August 2018. Costs were considered in the categories of full costs, shared costs, and capital or annualised costs.RESULTS: Owing to uncertainty in costing of OTs, two models - with different annualisation times assigned to the capital costs - were developed to demonstrate the difference. For shared costs, correction factors were determined using either an activity-based (workload) factor or a more generic estimation of workload using theatre nursing staff as a percentage of total hospital nursing staff.To determine a ZAR/min cost of creating a minute of available theatre time, all the annual costs were divided by minutes that the OTs are explicitly available, each year, to provide patient care. The model was then populated with costs using the appropriate correction factors. The longer annualisation model costed OT time at ZAR31.46 per minute, and the shorter annualisation model at ZAR33.77 per minute. In both the longer and shorter capital annualisation models, nursing was the largest contributor to costs at 36{\%} and 33{\%}, respectively, followed by construction costs at 9{\%} and 11{\%}, and then OT equipment at 8{\%} and 11{\%}.CONCLUSIONS: An inclusive, top-down costing model for OTs in SA was developed. This costing model will support work to develop costing for individual procedures and the appropriate charge for planned and emergency OT time, and to better determine budgeting for OT services. Meaningful critique of the model will improve its fidelity, and is likely to increase its utility, especially as SA moves towards universal health coverage.}

 abstract     = {Although integrin alpha 2 subunit (ITGA2) mediates cancer progression and metastasis, its transfer by exosomes has not been investigated in prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to determine the role of exosomal ITGA2 derived from castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells in promoting aggressive phenotypes in androgen receptor (AR)-positive cells. Exosomes were co-incubated with recipient cells and tested for different cellular assays. ITGA2 was enriched in exosomes derived from CRPC cells. Co-culture of AR-positive cells with CRPC-derived exosomes increased their proliferation, migration, and invasion by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which was reversed via ITGA2 knockdown or inhibition of exosomal uptake by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD). Ectopic expression of ITGA2 reproduced the effect of exosomal ITGA2 in PCa cells. ITGA2 transferred by exosomes exerted its effect within a shorter time compared to that triggered by its endogenous expression. The difference of ITGA2 protein expression in localized tumors and those with lymph node metastatic tissues was indistinguishable. Nevertheless, its abundance was higher in circulating exosomes collected from PCa patients when compared with normal subjects. Our findings indicate the possible role of the exosomal-ITGA2 transfer in altering the phenotype of AR-positive cells towards more aggressive phenotype. Thus, interfering with exosomal cargo transfer may inhibit the development of aggressive phenotype in PCa cells.}

 abstract     = {AIMS: The bioactivities of Santolina corsica Jord. {\&} Fourr. n-hexane (EHS) and methanol (EMS) extracts were evaluated in relation to their chemical profile.MAIN METHODS: EHS and EMS were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry () and high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD), respectively. Antioxidant activity was determined by beta-carotene bleaching, Ferric Reducing Activity Power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) tests. Nitric oxide (NO) production was assessed in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Anti-proliferative activity was evaluated by MTT assay on A549, HeLa, PC3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, and non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. Cell motility, migration and invasion were assessed by wound-healing scratch, migration and invasion assays, respectively. DNA fragmentation was tested by TUNEL assay. Cells morphology was studied by phase-contrast microscopy. Procaspase-8, -9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and COX-2 expression levels were evaluated by immunoblotting analysis.KEY FINDINGS: Kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (5878.67mg/100g of extract), chlorogenic acid (746.11mg/100g), and rosmarinic acid (550.16mg/100g) were the dominant EMS constituents. EHS showed myrcene (18.86{\%}) as the main compound, followed by palmitic acid methyl and ethyl esters (9.35 and 9.16{\%}, respectively), beta-phellandrene (8.48{\%}), and ar-curcumene (5.63{\%}). Both extracts showed promising anti-proliferative activity on all tested cancer cells, without inducing cytotoxicity in non-tumorigenic cells MCF-10A. Moreover, extracts inhibited motility, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, inducing apoptosis. EHS decreased NO production, showing anti-inflammatory activity.SIGNIFICANCE: S. corsica extracts might be potentially useful in cancer treatment, since reduce invasive and migratory potential of MDA-MB-231 cells triggering apoptosis.}

 abstract     = {Traditionally, studies to address the characterization of mechanisms promoting tumor aggressiveness and progression have been focused only on primary tumor analyses, which could provide relevant information but have limitations to really characterize the more aggressive tumor population. To overcome these limitations, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent a noninvasive and valuable tool for real-time profiling of disseminated tumor cells. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the value of CTC enumeration and characterization to identify markers associated with the outcome and the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). For that aim, the CTC population from 32 patients diagnosed with TNBC was isolated and characterized. This population showed important cell plasticity in terms of expression of epithelia/mesenchymal and stemness markers, suggesting the relevance of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) intermediate phenotypes for efficient tumor dissemination. Importantly, the CTC signature demonstrated prognostic value to predict the patients' outcome and pointed to a relevant role of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and androgen receptor (AR) for TNBC biology. Furthermore, we also analyzed the usefulness of the AR and TIMP1 blockade to target TNBC proliferation and dissemination using in vitro and in vivo zebra fish and mouse models. Overall, the molecular characterization of CTCs from advanced TNBC patients identifies highly specific biomarkers with potential applicability as noninvasive prognostic markers and reinforced the value of TIMP1 and AR as potential therapeutic targets to tackle the most aggressive breast cancer.}

The goal of our research is to examine the effects of an average room fire on the survival possibility of a trapped person and on the building structure, taking into account features of the Eastern European architecture. First, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was performed to examine the change of temperature, oxygen, and carbon monoxide concentration in a selected room in a vacant building used for military training. Based on the results, a 1:1 scale fire experiment was carried out with the parameters used in the simulation. The experiment was repeated once with the same settings. It was observed that without the intervention of firefighters, the temperature in the experiment could have rapidly reached 400{\textdegree}C, as suggested by the simulation, which could have caused structural damage to the building. Furthermore, after 3min the carbon monoxide concentration reached 400ppm in both experiments and the simulation, which is a harmful level to people trapped inside the room. Also, in the experiment there was sufficient oxygen at the ground level with what people can survive 3min.}

 abstract     = {In this paper, we present a disposable, colorimetric, user-friendly and mass-customizable dermal patch for chronological collection and discrete real-time in situ measurement of sweat secretion over a small area of skin. The patch consists of a laminated filter paper patterned into radially arranged channels/fingers with water-activated dyes at their tips. As channels are filled during perspiration, their tips change color once fully saturated, providing easily identifiable levels of water loss which in turn can be mapped to personal dehydration levels. The patch can be manufactured at low cost in a variety of sizes to allow hydration monitoring for individuals participating in activities under different conditions (intensity, temperature, humidity, etc.). Furthermore, we describe an analytical model that enables mass customization of such a flexible wearable system accommodating a broad range of sweat rates and volumes to generate patch designs that are personalized to an individual's sweat rate, desired time of usage, and the temporal resolution of the required feedback. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we characterized laser-fabricated patches that cover (7cm*5cm) area of skin having various wicking materials, thicknesses (180-540m), and pore sizes (3-11m). Tests were conducted at various flow rates simulating different sweating intensities in the range of 1.5-15mg/cm2/min. Experimental results for the case of a half-marathon runner targeting 90min of usage and sweating at a rate of 1.5mg/cm2/min indicated measurement accuracy of 98.3{\%} when the patch is completely filled.}

The aims of this study were evaluate an experimental programme to improve the CPR skills of staff operating in non-intensive areas of our general hospital and to test the usefulness of placing automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) within these areas. In the experimental phase, two AEDs were placed in 2 non-intensive wards of our hospital for 8 months. The staff of these wards received specific training in CPR and early defibrillation (CPR-D). The devices were used in 19 cases; for defibrillation in four cases of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (three patients were discharged alive from hospital), and for monitoring three supraventricular arrhythmias, one bradyarrhythmia and 11 cardiac rhythms during critical situations. In the implementation phase, four AEDs were indefinitely assigned to as many non-intensive awards. Periodical CPR-D courses and refresher exercises were run; the cardiology staff co-operated in the maintenance of the AEDs and in the registration of technical and clinical data. In the first period of this phase (9 months), AEDs were utilized in 24 cases by the ward-staff: in nine cases for VF (three patients were discharged alive from hospital) and in 15 cases for other rhythm detection in critical conditions. The number and the quality of these uses seem to confirm the favourable impact of the adoption of a more user-friendly defibrillator, such as an AED. The active co-operation between intensive and non-intensive staff was important to facilitate a quick activation of the chain of survival outside the intensive care units. We conclude that AEDs, which were developed for out-of-hospital use by non-physician operators, are suitable for use inside the hospital as well.}

Similar injuries affecting the head of the pancreas are best managed by simple external drainage, even if there is suspected pancreatic duct injury. Pancreaticoduodenectomy should be reserved for extensive injuries to the head of the pancreas, and should be practised as part of damage control. Most complications should initially be treated by a combination of nutrition, percutaneous drainage and endoscopic stenting.}

 abstract     = {Exposure of the vertebrate embryo to maternal hormones can have long-lasting effects on its phenotype, which has been studied extensively by experimentally manipulating maternal steroids, mostly androgens, in bird eggs. Yet, there is a severe lack of understanding of how and when these effects are actually mediated, hampering both underlying proximate and ultimate explanations. Here we report a novel finding that the embryo expresses androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ERalpha) mRNA in its extraembryonic membranes (EMs) as early as before its own hormone production starts, suggesting a novel substrate for action of maternal hormones on the offspring. We also report the first experimental evidence for steroid receptor regulation in the avian embryo in response to yolk steroid levels: the level of AR is dependent on yolk androgen levels only in the EMs but not in body tissues, suggesting embryonic adaptation to maternal hormones. The results also solve the problem of uptake of lipophilic steroids from the yolk, why they affect multiple traits, and how they could mediate maternal effects without affecting embryonic sexual differentiation.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: The effects of acute stress on allergic symptoms are little understood. The intention of this clinical study was to study the effects of acute stress and related mediators in allergic rhinitis (AR), taking the wheal and flare reaction in skin prick testing (SPT) as a readout.METHODS: 19 healthy and 21 AR patients were first subjected to SPTs with grass pollen-, birch pollen- and house dust mite allergen extracts, histamine and negative control. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a standardized Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), followed by SPT on the contralateral forearm. Stress responders were identified based on the salivary cortisol levels and State-subscale of State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). Blood samples were collected before and after TSST and adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, oxytocin, platelet activating factor and prostaglandin D2 were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).RESULTS: SPT results of 14/21 allergics and 11/19 healthy who responded with stress after TSST were evaluated. No significant differences regarding SPT to allergens or histamine before and after the stress test could be calculated at the group level. But, the wheal and flare sizes after TSST increased or decreased substantially in several individuals, and unmasked sensitization in one "healthy" person, which could not be correlated with any mediator tested. The most significant finding, however, was that, independent of TSST, the baseline levels of oxytocin and noradrenaline were significantly higher in allergics.CONCLUSION: High baseline levels of noradrenaline points toward higher stress levels in allergic patients, which might be counterregulated by elevated oxytocin. Moreover, our data indicate that acute stress may have a significant influence on SPT fidelity in susceptible individuals.}

The highest ARs were found for women in the age group 20-34, for divorced/separated, for women with a higher educational level and for women with only one child. The proportion of pregnancies which ended in abortion was one in four; for teenagers and women over 34 years it was one in two. This proportion was also higher for women not married, students and women with two or more children. Ninety-eight percent of all abortions took place in private clinics, the woman's physical/mental health being the medical indication for these abortions. Abortion was most often performed within eight weeks of gestation (65{\%}). Late abortion ocurred more frequently among teenagers and women of low educational level. Eighteen percent of women had repeated abortions. A high proportion (61{\%}) of women applying for abortion had not used the Family Planning (FP) services in the previous two years; adolescents and women of low educational level had the lowest frequencies of FP use.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with that of other European countries, the AR in Asturias was intermediate. The results regarding adolescents show the need for evaluation and promotion of sex education and contraceptive programmes. The lower and later use of abortion by women of low educational level shows inequalities that call for specific action.}

 abstract     = {Cataracts, a clouding of the eye lens, are a leading cause of visual impairment and are responsible for one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. Although generally safe and effective, cataract surgery can lead to a secondary lens abnormality due to transition of lens epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype (EMT) and opacification of the posterior lens capsular bag. Occurring in up to 40{\%} of cataract cases over time, posterior capsule opacification (PCO) introduces additional treatment costs and reduced quality of life for patients. Studies have shown that PCO pathogenesis is driven in part by TGF-beta, signaling through the action of the family of Smad coactivators to effect changes in gene transcription. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of Smad-7, a well characterized inhibitor of TGF-beta -mediated Smad signaling, to suppress the EMT response in lens epithelial cells associated with PCO pathogenesis. Treatment of lens epithelial cells with a cell-permeable form of Smad7 variant resulted in suppressed expression of EMT markers such as alpha smooth muscle actin and fibronectin. A single application of cell-permeable Smad7 variant in the capsular bag of a mouse cataract surgery model resulted in suppression of gene transcripts encoding alpha smooth muscle actin and fibronectin. These results point to Smad7 as a promising biotherapeutic agent for prevention or substantial reduction in the incidence of PCO following cataract surgery.}

In this study, we applied transcriptomic, proteomic, and medical information to identify glycolysis-related key genes and modules associated with PRAD. Then, the glycolysis-related lncRNA/lncRNAs/pseudogenes-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. Analysis of DNA methylation status and expression data determined a DNA methylation-dysregulated three-DE-mRNAs signature for predicting diagnosis, ANGPTL4, GNE, and HSPA in PRAD patients and healthy control. Several lncRNAs/pseudogenes, significantly correlated with the overall survival PVT1, CA5BP1, MIRLET7BHG, SNHG12, and ZNF37BP and disease-free survival status, MALAT1, GUSBP11, MIRLET7BHG, and SNHG1, of patients with PRAD were determined. The methylation profile of DE-lncRNA/pseudogenes was significantly proper for predicting PRAD prognostic model. The transcription level of 6 DE-mRNA ANGPTL4, QSOX1, BIK, CLDN3, DDIT4, and TFF3 was correlated with cancer-related fibroblast infiltration in PRAD. The mutated form of 7 mRNAs, COL5A1, IDH1, HK2, DDIT4, GNE, and QSOX1, was associated with PRAD. In addition to the glycolysis pathway, DE-RNAs play regulatory roles on several pathways, including DNA damage, RTK, cell cycle, RAS/MAPK, TSC/mTOR and PI3K/AKT, AR hormone, and EMT. Overall, our study improves our knowledge of the relation between lncRNAs/pseudogenes and miRNA related to glycolysis and PRAD pathogenesis.

RAS was diagnosed by direct duplex/Doppler ultrasound of the renal artery, resistance index, and imaging. The aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) was determined from morning blood samples taken with the patients supine after > or =2 h of rest. A positive ARR (>50) was followed by saline infusion to exclude primary hyperaldosteronism. SA was evaluated by nasal breathing flow screening; when positive [apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) >5/h], complete polysomnography was performed.RESULTS: Of 161 patients (age, 66.0 +/- 13.1 years; BMI, 28.6 +/- 5.1 kg), 131 had previously identified hypertension (duration, 12.7 +/- 11.5 years; 1.9 +/- 1.5 antihypertensive medications). SA was found in 114 (70.8{\%}) patients [18{\%} mild (AHI: 5-15/h), 26.8{\%} moderate (15.1-30/h), and 24.2{\%} severe (>30/h)]. Aldosterone levels exceeded 160 pg/ml in 22 of 23 patients with hyperaldosteronism; 4 had primary and 12 had secondary hyperaldosteronism. Thirteen (8.1{\%}) patients had RAS. Three secondary causes were found in 1 patient (0.6{\%}), > or =2 in 25 (15.5{\%}), and > or =1 in 124 patients (77.0{\%}). Of 150 detected secondary causes, only 5 were recognized previously.CONCLUSIONS: Secondary causes of hypertension are common and predominantly unrecognized in patients with hypertensive urgency/emergency. Co-prevalence of secondary causes occurs in about 15{\%} and should be considered before therapeutic intervention.}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of body cooling via a liquid-cooled garment (LCG) underneath a PPE ensemble on perceived thermal strain, physiological responses and ergonomics during an intermittent treadmill exercise in warm environmental conditions. The results of the present study indicated that the concomitant wearing of LCG underneath the PPE ensemble significantly reduced subjective perception of heat and alleviated overall increase in body temperature and heart rate while no impact of wearing LCG on ergonomic features was found. The extension of the present findings to practical applications in occupational settings requires further research on a LCG system design and performance evaluations while the LCG is incorporated within the PPE ensemble. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Implementation of a LCG underneath PPE for body cooling was investigated, focusing on its impact on individuals' perceived thermal strain, physiological responses and ergonomics. The findings of the present study indicated that body cooling via a wearable LCG underneath PPE significantly alleviated both perceived thermal and physiological strain in uncompensable heat stress condition.}

 abstract     = {Developmental and environmental signaling networks often converge during plant growth in response to changing conditions. Stress-induced hormones, such as jasmonates (JAs), can influence growth by crosstalk with other signals like brassinosteroids (BRs) and ethylene (ET). Nevertheless, it is unclear how avoidance of an abiotic stress triggers local changes in development as a response. It is known that stress hormones like JAs/ET and BRs can regulate the division rate of cells from the first asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) in meristems, suggesting that stem cell activation may take part in developmental changes as a stress-avoidance-induced response. The root system is a prime responder to stress conditions in soil. Together with the primary root and lateral roots (LRs), adventitious roots (ARs) are necessary for survival in numerous plant species. AR and LR formation is affected by soil pollution, causing substantial root architecture changes by either depressing or enhancing rooting as a stress avoidance/survival response. Here, a detailed overview of the crosstalk between JAs, ET, BRs, and the stress mediator nitric oxide (NO) in auxin-induced AR and LR formation, with/without cadmium and arsenic, is presented. Interactions essential in achieving a balance between growth and adaptation to Cd and As soil pollution to ensure survival are reviewed here in the model species Arabidopsis and rice.}

 abstract     = {Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors are front-line treatments for highly aggressive prostate cancer. However, prolonged inhibition of AR triggers a compensatory activation of PI3K pathway, most often due to the genomic loss of tumor suppressor PTEN, driving progression to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage, which has very poor prognosis. We uncovered a novel mechanism of PTEN downregulation triggered by LIMK2, which contributes significantly to CRPC pathogenesis. LIMK2 is a CRPC-specific target. Its depletion fully reverses tumorigenesis in vivo. LIMK2 phosphorylates PTEN at five sites, degrading and inhibiting its activity, thereby driving highly aggressive oncogenic phenotypes in cells and in vivo. PTEN also degrades LIMK2 in a feedback loop, which was confirmed in prostates from PTEN-/- and PTEN+/+ mice. LIMK2 is also the missing link between hypoxia and PTEN degradation in CRPC. This is the first study to show a feedback loop between PTEN and its regulator. Uncovering the LIMK2-PTEN loop provides a powerful therapeutic opportunity to retain the activity and stability of PTEN protein by inhibiting LIMK2, thereby halting the progression to CRPC, ADT-resistance and drug-resistance.}

The role of PARP-1 in prostate cancer development and progression is not fully understood. The present study investigated the function of PARP-1 in prostate growth and tumorigenesis in vivo. Functional inactivation of PARP-1 by gene-targeted deletion led to a significant reduction in the prostate gland size in young PARP-1-/- mice (6 weeks) compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. To determine the effect of PARP-1 functional loss on prostate cancer onset, PARP-1-/- mice were crossed with the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Pathological assessment of prostate tumors revealed that TRAMP+/-, PARP-1-/- mice exhibited higher grade prostate tumors compared with TRAMP+/- PARP-1+/+ (16-28 weeks) that was associated with a significantly increased proliferative index and decreased apoptosis among the epithelial cells in TRAMP+/- PARP-1-/- prostate tumors. Furthermore tumors harboring PARP-1 loss, exhibited a downregulation of nuclear androgen receptor. Impairing PARP-1 led to increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Smads that correlated with induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as established by loss of E-cadherin and beta-catenin and upregulation of N-cadherin and ZEB-1. Our findings suggest that impaired PARP-1 function promotes prostate tumorigenesis in vivo via TGF-beta-induced EMT. Defining the EMT control by PARP-1 during prostate cancer progression is of translational significance for optimizing PARP-1 therapeutic targeting and predicting response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.}

 abstract     = {An intervention model for prevention of HIV infection among male transvestite sex workers in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is described.  Sex workers have been neglected in most AIDS prevention programs, primarily due to the moralistic attitudes permeating most prevention models.  The model was viewed as existing in the context of the sex industry, in order to deflect attention from the prostitute and direct it to the whole series of relations between the client, sex worker, policeman, and others involved.  Health promotion strategies must recognize that the sex industry will always exist.  Promotion of healthier lifestyles, of community consciousness, and of more responsible sexuality must take place according to the reality of the culture and reference points of the target community.  The AIDS Foundation of Puerto Rico in 1991 extended its work among homosexuals to include male transvestites in San Juan.  A male transvestite was contracted to work full time for the project.  In the beginning, his activities were limited to being present in the street, identifying himself and speaking informally about AIDS and the project, and distributing condoms.  Nine months later, the sex workers requested HIV testing, which revealed that 95{\%} of the 48 tested were seronegative.  19 transvestites were interviewed in August 1992 to provide information on the characteristics and needs of the community.  The workers were found to be young, with relatively limited education, incomes primarily from sex work, and high levels of alcohol and drug use.  Most had no regular partners and the majority of their sexual activity was with clients.  Over half engaged in high risk sexual activity without protection.  The intervention model, developed with information collected from the transvestites and using as a frame of reference some models for similar populations, called for 8 weekly 1-hour sessions intended to provide information on HIV/AIDS, strengthen participant self-esteem, reduce high risk behaviors, increase safe sex practices, and initiate a process of community promotion.  Each session had specific objectives to be met using a variety of participatory activities directed by members of the same or related communities.  The themes were selected by the participants.  A follow-up questionnaire 3 months later attempted to evaluate the impact of the intervention on sexual behavior, general health habits, and alcohol use.}

Mean follow-up was 18 months, ranging from 7 to 28 months. All patients but one had biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis, including five cases of cirrhosis. All patients had been chronic HBs Ag carriers for more than 1 year and had active replication as assessed by the presence of serum HBV DNA (mean titre, 270 pg/ml, ranging from 12 to 997 pg/ml, Genostics method). HBe Ag was present in 7 of the 10 patients. Pretreatment creatinine was normal. In four of the 10 patients, HBV DNA became undetectable respectively 1, 1, 5, and 11 months after beginning ARA-AMP. In five patients, HBV DNA decreased during ARA-AMP therapy but subsequently increased although no change was noted during the follow-up period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

This study analysed the protein expression profiles of a previously generated isogenic 22Rv1 prostate cancer model of radioresistance using DigiWest multiplex protein profiling for a selection of 90 signalling proteins. Comparative analysis of the profiles identified a substantial change in the expression of 43 proteins. Differential PARP-1, AR, p53, Notch-3 and YB-1 protein levels were independently validated using Western Blotting. Pharmacological targeting of these proteins was associated with a mild but significant radiosensitisation effect at 4Gy. This study supports the clinical relevance of isogenic in vitro models of radioresistance and clarifies the molecular radiation response of prostate cancer cells.}

 abstract     = {The treatment of multiple myeloma has changed over the last 20 years. We investigated the effects of theses changes on patient survival in the current practice of a rheumatology ward. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were hospitalised between 1972 and 1993: 30 from 1972 to 1976, 70 from 1977 to 1981, 86 from 1982 to 1986, 75 from 1987 to 1991 and 18 from 1992 to 1993. Staging according to Durie and Salmon was I in 8{\%}, II in 29{\%} and III in 65{\%}. In principle, the initial therapy was monochemotherapy in 65{\%} of the cases and polychemotherapy in 35{\%}. At the time of the present study, 197 patients have died. The actuarial curves of survival were similar in all historical classes defined by the date of first admission. Curves of median of follow-up and of floating means were level between 1972 and 1990. No correlation was found between the date of first admission and survival in the 174 patients who died between 1972 and 1987. The following parameters were associated with longer survival: achievement of an objective response on chemotherapy, lower patient's age, high haemoglobin, low creatinine, low stage according to Durie and Salmon, low number of plasma cells in bone marrow, low calcemia and low levels of IgA, monoclonal component. The comparison of prognosis factors in historical classes showed a difference only for haemoglobin which was lower in the earlier class. The type of the first chemotherapy regimen varied widely between historical classes. The number of responders was significantly greater after polychemotherapy than after monochemotherapy but no correlation was observed between the type of chemotherapy and survival. The frequencies of early death, and the causes of death in general, were not different in the historical classes. The lack of improvement of survival over the last 20 years shows that the efficacy of current chemotherapies is limited, a conclusion which warrants the exploration of other therapeutic avenues.}

Cytokines promotes ligand independent activation of AR. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in CRPC patients and regulate AR activity. However, progression to CRPC is not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed differential protein expression in LNCaP cells treated with IL-6 using proteomics. Results revealed altered expression of 27 proteins and Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 plays a predominant role in co-regulation of altered proteins. Interestingly, IL-6 induced VCP expression through Pim-1 via STAT3 is AR independent there by suggesting a role for VCP in CRPC. Transfection of LNCaP cells for VCP overexpression showed an increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion where as its inhibition by NMS-873 showed the reverse effect causing cell death. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that cell death occurs due to apoptosis by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, elevated cell cycle inhibitors p21, p27kip1, and active PARP and reduced Bcl-2. VCP promotes cell invasion and migration by altering E-cadherin and Vimentin levels inversely triggering EMT of PCa cells. VCP immunostaining revealed no staining in BPH but strong staining in PCa. This study determines VCP may play an important role in progression to CRPC and it can be a favorable target with to develop new therapies to treat ADT resistant prostate cancer.}

Clinicians may become desensitized to alarms and fail to respond to clinically relevant alarms. HWDs could make patient information continuously accessible, support situation awareness, and help clinicians prioritize alarms.METHOD: Experiment 1 ( n = 76) tested whether nonclinicians monitoring simulated patients benefited from vital sign information continuously displayed on an HWD while they performed a secondary calculation task. Experiment 2 ( n = 13) tested, across three separate experimental sessions, how effectively nursing trainees monitored simulated patients' vital signs under three different display conditions while they assessed a simulated patient.RESULTS: In Experiment 1, participants who had access to continuous patient information on an HWD responded to clinically important alarms 25.9{\%} faster and were 6.7 times less likely to miss alarms compared to participants who only heard alarms. In Experiment 2, participants using an HWD answered situation awareness questions 18.9{\%} more accurately overall than when they used alarms only. However, the effect was significant in only two of the three experimental sessions.CONCLUSION: HWDs may help users maintain continuous awareness of multiple remote processes without affecting their performance on ongoing tasks.APPLICATION: The outcomes may apply to contexts where access to continuous streams of information from remote locations is useful, such as patient monitoring or clinical supervision.}

 abstract     = {To capture both epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations of CTCs at different metastatic stages of PCa patients, here we constructed a novel dual-antibody-functionalized microfluidic device by employing antibodies against PSMA and EpCAM. In vitro experiments with the dual capture system for capturing both LnCAP and LnCAP-EMT cells have shown significantly enhanced capture efficiency as compared to that of the EpCAM single capture system. Furthermore, the dual capture system could successfully identify CTCs in 20 out of 24 (83.3{\%}) PCa patients, and the CTCs counts from the dual capture system were statistically correlated with the TNM stage of patients ( P < 0.05), while conventional diagnostic methods, such as serum PSA level and Gleason score, failed to correlate to patient TNM stages. To further explore potential clinical application of our dual capture system, captured CTCs were recovered and subjected to qRT-PCR to quantify known factors involved in PCa development and therapy. The results demonstrated that the combined detection of SChLAP1 and PSA in CTCs is a potential marker for identifying patients with metastatic PCa, while detection of AR and PD-L1 in CTCs may have the potential to determine the sensitivity of PCa patients to androgen deprivation therapy and immunotherapy, respectively. Taken together, the dual-antibody-functionalized microfluidic device established in our study overcomes the limitations of some CTC capture platforms that only detect epithelial or mesenchymal CTCs in PCa patients, and detection of the PCa-related RNA signatures from purified CTCs holds great promise to offer warnings for early metastasis of PCa and may provide guidance for therapy decisions.}

During the process of ovulation, granulosa cells (GCs) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and integrin-interacting protein kindlin 2 is a well-known regulator in EMT. Therefore, our objective here was to compare the expression levels of kindlin 2 in luteinized GCs between patients with PCOS and control women and the relationship between kindlin 2 and PCOS pathogenesis. In this study, kindlin 2 expression was significantly increased in luteinized GCs from patients with PCOS, and kindlin 2 could be induced by testosterone both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, kindlin 2 was positively correlated with androgen receptor (AR) in PCOS GCs. Taken together, kindlin 2 may play a role in luteinized GCs, especially in the case of excess androgen. Further studies are required to assess the specific role of kindlin 2 in follicular development and PCOS pathogenesis.}

Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a key player in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, its clinical value and role in NE differentiation in advanced PC has not been fully investigated.METHODS: Two hundred and eight patients from a multicenter, prospective cohort of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with available RNA sequencing data were analyzed for tumor FAP mRNA expression, and its association with overall survival (OS) and NE tumor features was investigated.RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (10{\%}) were found to have high FAP mRNA expression. Compared to the rest, this subset had a proportionally higher exposure to taxanes and AR signaling inhibitors (abiraterone or enzalutamide) and was characterized by active NE signaling, evidenced by high NEPC- and low AR-gene expression scores. These patients with high tumor mRNA FAP expression had a more aggressive clinical course and significantly shorter survival (12 months) compared to those without altered FAP expression (28 months, log-rank p = 0.016).CONCLUSIONS: FAP expression may serve as a valuable NE marker indicating a worse prognosis in patients with metastatic CRPC.}

We compared 3-year overall and cancer event-free survival (EFS) among patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who obtained substantial portions of their care in both systems and those whose care was obtained predominantly in the VA or in the Medicare fee-for-service system.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients older than 65 years with stages I to III colon cancer diagnosed from 1999 to 2001 in VA and non-VA facilities. Dual use of VA and non-VA colon cancer care was categorized as predominantly VA use, dual use, or predominantly non-VA use. Extended Cox regression models evaluated associations between survival and dual use.RESULTS: VA and non-VA users (all stages) had reduced hazard of dying compared with dual users [e.g., for stage I, VA HR 0.40, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.56; non-VA HR 0.54, 95{\%} CI: 0.38-0.78). For EFS, stage I findings were similar (VA HR 0.47, 95{\%} CI: 0.35-0.62; non-VA HR 0.64, 95{\%} CI: 0.47-0.86). Stage II and III VA users, but not non-VA users, had improved EFS (stage II: VA HR 0.74, 95{\%} CI: 0.56-0.97; non-VA HR 0.92, 95{\%} CI: 0.69-1.22; stage III: VA HR 0.73, 95{\%} CI: 0.56-0.94; non-VA HR 0.81, 95{\%} CI: 0.62-1.06).CONCLUSIONS: Improved survival among VA and non-VA compared with dual users raises questions about coordination of care and unmet needs.IMPACT: Additional study is needed to understand why these differences exist, why patients use both systems, and how systems may be improved to yield better outcomes in this population.}

Patients with a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension on netarsudil and at least one other hypotensive agent for glaucoma who had at least one month of follow-up were included. Patients with additional procedures or glaucoma medication changes were excluded. The main outcome measures were IOP reduction, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, netarsudil responder type, and complication rates.Results: 236 eyes of 236 patients were included. The mean baseline IOP was 19.06{\textpm}4.6mmHg on an average of 4 ocular hypotensive medications. 196 (83.1{\%}) patients experienced IOP reduction at the first follow-up visit of 2.84{\textpm}0.30mmHg at 55.66{\textpm}51.89 days. IOP reduction at the second visit among these patients was 3.01{\textpm}0.44mmHg at 133.24{\textpm}77.63 days. After starting netarsudil, 59{\%} had a sustained response (median duration of 315 days), 25{\%} had a robust response (>20{\%} IOP reduction for at least 80{\%} of visits), and 10{\%} had a super response (>20{\%} and >10mmHg IOP reduction). Netarsudil was effective as an adjunctive therapy across all baseline IOP categories with greater relative IOP reduction in higher baseline IOP groups.Conclusions: Netarsudil is an effective adjunctive glaucoma therapy. IOP reductions between 2 and 3mmHg are typical, but a minority had more pronounced and sustained effects (>10mmHg). Further analysis is needed to assess specific demographic and clinical factors predictive of these robust responses.}

 abstract     = {In plant and animal breeding, sometimes observations are not independently distributed. There may exist a correlated relationship between the observations. In the presence of highly correlated observations, the classical premise of independence between observations is violated. Plant and animal breeders are particularly interested to study the genetic components for different important traits. In general, for estimating heritability, a random component in the model must adhere to specific assumptions, such as random components, including errors, having a normal distribution, and being identically independently distributed. However, in many real-world situations, all of the assumptions are not fulfilled. In this study, correlated error structures are considered errors that are associated to estimate heritability for the full-sib model. The number of immediately preceding observations in an autoregressive series that are used to predict the value at the current observation is defined as the order of the autoregressive models. First-order and second-order autoregressive models i.e., AR(1) and AR(2) error structures, have been considered. In the case of the full-sib model, theoretical derivation of Expected Mean sum square (EMS) considering AR(1) structure has been obtained. A numerical explanation is provided for the derived EMS considering AR(1) structure. The predicted mean squares error (MSE) is obtained after including the AR(1) error structures in the model, and heritability is estimated using the resulting equations. It is noticed that correlated errors have a major influence on heritability estimation. Different correlation patterns, such as AR(1) and AR(2), can be inferred to change heritability estimates and MSE values. To attain better results, several combinations are offered for various scenarios.}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that represent a new mechanism to regulate mRNA post-transcriptionally. It is involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological process. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been associated with the multistep progression of PCa from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), localized adenocarcinoma to metastatic castration-resistance PCa (CRPC). Identification of unique miRNA could provide new biomarkers for PCa and develop into therapeutic strategies. In this review, we will summarize a broad spectrum of both tumor suppressive and oncogenic miRNAs, and their mechanisms contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.}

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between CTCs and clinicopathological features and discussed whether CTCs could be used as a biomarker for metastasis in osteosarcoma.Methods: We enrolled 50 osteosarcoma patients with Enneking Stage IIB and Stage III and detected CTCs in 5ml of peripheral blood samples collected from patients using the Canpatrol CTC detection platform. Subsequently, multiplex RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) based on various molecular markers was performed to identify and classify CTCs. The relationships between clinical pathological features and CTC counts, subtypes (epithelial type, E type; hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal type, H type; mesenchymal type, M type), and insulin-like growth factor mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) expression in CTCs were analyzed.Results: CTCs were detected in 86{\%} (43/50) of the osteosarcoma patients. The CTC counts, especially the total CTCs and H-type CTCs, signifcantly differed between Enneking Stage IIB and Stage III patients (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the CTC count or type and other clinicopathological features (P > 0.05). There were significant differences in the expression of IMP3 in different types of CTCs, and the IMP3 positive rates in E/H/M type CTCs were 38.4, 65.6, and 62.0{\%}, respectively (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that IMP3-positive CTC count had the best performance for diagnostic metastasis, with the largest area under the curve of 0.873 and cutoff value of four cells/5ml blood (sensitivity = 87.5{\%}; specificity = 82.4{\%}). Serial CTC monitoring in one patient suggested that total CTCs and H-type CTCs were associated with disease progression.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the CTCs, especially the IMP3-positive CTCs and H/M-type CTCs, are related to the metastasis of osteosarcoma.}

GV1001, a human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit, is an injectable formulation used as a cancer vaccine. It functions as a cell penetrating peptide to regulate cell proliferation. Here, we found that GV1001 effectively suppressed proliferation of prostatic stromal myofibroblasts (WPMY-1) and prostatic epithelial cells (RWPE-1 and WPE-NA22) treated with dihydrotestosterone. Also, GV1001 bound to androgen receptors (ARs) in the cytosol of stromal and epithelial cells. In an experimental animal model implanted with an infusion pump for spontaneous and continuous release of testosterone, revealed that GV1001 reduced prostatic hypertrophy and inhibited the cell proliferation and the expression of Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and prostate specific antigen. In addition, GV1001 prevented fibrosis of the prostate by downregulating expression of prostatic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, Snail, Slug, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, and by up-regulating E-cadherin. Taken together, these results suggest that GV1001, which suppresses TGF-beta-mediated EMT by outcompeting testosterone for binding to AR, is a potential therapeutic drug for BPH accompanied by prostatic fibrosis.}

Here, we aimed to identify the differences in genetic profiles of patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and CRPC and stratify HSPC patients to identify mutations associated with CRPC progression.METHODS: A total of 103 samples were collected, including 62 DNA samples from the tumor tissues of 59 HSPC patients and 41 cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from prostate cancer patients at different cancer stages. Targeted sequence was conducted on both the tissue DNA and cfDNA. The associations between mutations and clinical outcomes (CRPC-free time) were analyzed using chi2 test, logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis.RESULTS: By comparing to that of cfDNA sequencing, the results from DNA sequencing of 1-needle (80{\%}) and mixed 12-needle (77.8{\%}) biopsies are highly comparable. FOXA1 (30.5{\%}), CDK12 (23.7{\%}), and TP53 (22.0{\%}) were the top 3 most frequently mutated genes in HSPC patients; 50.8{\%} (30/59) and 44.1{\%} (26/59) HSPC patients had mutations in DDR and HRR pathway, respectively. Mutations in AR and APC as well as the members involved in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency and EMT pathway were often observed in CRPC samples. We established a panel of four genetic mutations (MSH2, CDK12, TP53, and RB1) to predict the risk of CRPC early progression with concordance index=0.609 and the area under curve of the ROC curve as 0.838.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that the cfDNA can be used in genetic profiling in prostate cancer and our newly established panel is capable of predicting which mHSPC patient has a high risk of early CRPC progression.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cancer (KIRC) is one of the most common cancers globally, with a poor prognosis. TLRs play a vital role in anticancer immunity and the regulation of the biological progress of tumour cells. However, the precise role of TLRs in KIRC is still ambiguous.METHODS: Various bioinformatics analysis and clinical validation of tissues were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of TLRs and their correlation with immune infiltration in KIRC.RESULTS: The expression of TLR2/3/7/8 was increased at both mRNA and protein levels in KIRC. TLRs in KIRC were involved in the activation of apoptosis, EMT, RAS/MAPK, and RTK pathways, as well as the inhibition of the cell cycle and the hormone AR pathway. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that high expression of TLR3 and low expression of TLR7/9/10 were resistant to most of the small molecules or drugs from CTRP. Enrichment analyses showed that TLRs were mainly involved in innate immune response, toll-like receptor signalling pathway, NF-kappa B signalling pathway, and TNF signalling pathway. Furthermore, a high-level TLR3 expression was associated with a favourable prognosis in KIRC. Validation research further confirmed that TLR3 expression was increased in KIRC tissues, and high TLR3 levels were associated with poor overall survival. Moreover, TLR3 in KIRC showed a positive association with an abundance of immune cells, including B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, macrophage, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and the expression of the immune biomarker sets. Several TLR3-associated kinase, miRNA, or transcription factor targets were also identified in KIRC.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that TLR3 serves as a prognostic biomarker and associated with immune infiltration in KIRC. This work lays a foundation for further studies on the role of TLR3 in the carcinogenesis and progression of KIRC.}

EGFR+/ERBB2+/ERBB3+CTCs BT and ERBB2+/ERBB3+CTCs AT significantly correlated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS; P=0.01 and P=0.02). Platinum-based therapy resulted in a reduced PFS (P=0.02) and an induction of PIK3CA expression in CTCs AT. In non-TNBC pts, BT, the expression pattern in CTCs was similar. AURKA+/ERCC1+CTCs were found in 40{\%} of HR-/HER2+pts BT and AT. In the latter group, NOTCH, PARP1 and SRC1 were only present AT and ERBB2+CTCs completely disappeared AT.

Despite strong research efforts current treatment options have a limited impact on glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) which contribute to GBM formation, progression and chemoresistance. Invasive growth of GSCs is in part associated with epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition (EMT), a mechanism associated with CD73 in several cancers. Here, we show that CD73 regulates the EMT activator SNAIL1 and further investigate the role of enzymatic and non-enzymatic CD73 activity in GBM progression. Reduction of CD73 protein resulted in significant suppression of GSC viability, proliferation and clonogenicity, whereas CD73 enzymatic activity exhibited negative effects only on GSC invasion involving impaired downstream adenosine (ADO) signalling. Furthermore, application of phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline, a potent immunomodulator, effectively inhibited ZEB1 and CD73 expression and significantly decreased viability, clonogenicity, and invasion of GSC in vitro cultures. Given the involvement of adenosine and A3 adenosine receptor in GSC invasion, we investigated the effect of the pharmacological inhibition of A3AR on GSC maintenance. Direct A3AR inhibition promoted apoptotic cell death and impaired the clonogenicity of GSC cultures. Taken together, our data indicate that CD73 is an exciting novel target in GBM therapy. Moreover, pharmacological interference, resulting in disturbed ADO signalling, provides new opportunities to innovate GBM therapy.}

There are several commercial kits (Oncotype DX genomic prostate score, Prolaris, among others) that use genomic changes, rearrangement or even non-coding RNA events. However, none of them are currently used in the routine clinical practice. Many recent studies indicate that miRNAs are relevant molecules (small single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression of more than 30{\%} of human genes) to be implement non-invasive biomarkers. However, contrasting to others tumors, such as breast cancer where miR-21 seems to be consistently upregulated; PCa data are controversial.

 abstract     = {Muscle wasting in cancer is a common and often occult condition that can occur prior to overt signs of weight loss and before a clinical diagnosis of cachexia can be made. Muscle wasting in cancer is an important and independent predictor of progressive functional impairment, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Although several therapeutic agents are currently in development for the treatment of muscle wasting or cachexia in cancer, the majority of these agents do not directly inhibit muscle loss. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have the potential to increase lean body mass (LBM) and hence muscle mass, without the untoward side effects seen with traditional anabolic agents. Enobosarm, a nonsteroidal SARM, is an agent in clinical development for prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with cancer (POWER 1 and 2 trials). The POWER trials are two identically designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, and multinational phase 3 trials to assess the efficacy of enobosarm for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in subjects initiating first-line chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To assess enobosarm's effect on both prevention and treatment of muscle wasting, no minimum weight loss is required. These pivotal trials have pioneered the methodological and regulatory fields exploring a therapeutic agent for cancer-associated muscle wasting, a process hereby described. In each POWER trial, subjects will receive placebo (n=150) or enobosarm 3mg (n=150) orally once daily for 147days. Physical function, assessed as stair climb power (SCP), and LBM, assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), are the co-primary efficacy endpoints in both trials assessed at day 84. Based on extensive feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the co-primary endpoints will be analyzed as a responder analysis. To be considered a physical function responder, a subject must have ≥10{\%} improvement in physical function compared to baseline. To meet the definition of response on LBM, a subject must have demonstrated no loss of LBM compared with baseline. Secondary endpoints include durability of response assessed at day 147 in those responding at day 84. A combined overall survival analysis for both studies is considered a key secondary safety endpoint. The POWER trials design was established with extensive clinical input and collaboration with regulatory agencies. The efficacy endpoints are a result of this feedback and discussion of the threshold for clinical benefit in patients at risk for muscle wasting. Full results from these studies will soon be published and will further guide the development of future anabolic trials.

 abstract     = {Androgens regulate biological pathways to promote proliferation, differentiation, and survival of benign and malignant prostate tissue. Androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapies exploit this dependence and are used in advanced prostate cancer to control disease progression. Contemporary treatment regimens involve sequential use of inhibitors of androgen synthesis or AR function. Although targeting the androgen axis has clear therapeutic benefit, its effectiveness is temporary, as prostate tumor cells adapt to survive and grow. The removal of androgens (androgen deprivation) has been shown to activate both epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD) programs. EMT has established roles in promoting biological phenotypes associated with tumor progression (migration/invasion, tumor cell survival, cancer stem cell-like properties, resistance to radiation and chemotherapy) in multiple human cancer types. NEtD in prostate cancer is associated with resistance to therapy, visceral metastasis, and aggressive disease. Thus, activation of these programs via inhibition of the androgen axis provides a mechanism by which tumor cells can adapt to promote disease recurrence and progression. Brachyury, Axl, MEK, and Aurora kinase A are molecular drivers of these programs, and inhibitors are currently in clinical trials to determine therapeutic applications. Understanding tumor cell plasticity will be important in further defining the rational use of androgen-targeted therapies clinically and provides an opportunity for intervention to prolong survival of men with metastatic prostate cancer.}

 abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasm and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Acquisition of resistance to conventional therapy is a major problem for PCa patient management. Several mechanisms have been described to promote therapy resistance in PCa, such as androgen receptor (AR) activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquisition of stem cell properties and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD). Recently, we identified Brachyury as a new biomarker of PCa aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In the present study we aimed to assess the role of Brachyury in PCa therapy resistance. We showed that Brachyury overexpression in prostate cancer cells lines increased resistance to docetaxel and cabazitaxel drugs, whereas Brachyury abrogation induced decrease in therapy resistance. Through ChiP-qPCR assays we further demonstrated that Brachyury is a direct regulator of AR expression as well as of the biomarker AMACR and the mesenchymal markers Snail and Fibronectin. Furthermore, in vitro Brachyury was also able to increase EMT and stem properties. By in silico analysis, clinically human Brachyury-positive PCa samples were associated with biomarkers of PCa aggressiveness and therapy resistance, including PTEN loss, and expression of NEtD markers, ERG and Bcl-2. Taken together, our results indicate that Brachyury contributes to tumor chemotherapy resistance, constituting an attractive target for advanced PCa patients.}

Previous work provides little insight into the decision-making process around evacuation. This study was conducted to identify factors that most heavily influenced the decisions to evacuate the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) New York Harbor Healthcare System's (NYHHS; New York USA) Manhattan Campus before Hurricane Irene in 2011 and before Superstorm Sandy in 2012.METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 11 senior leaders were conducted on the processes and factors that influenced the evacuation decisions prior to each event.RESULTS: The most influential factor in the decision to evacuate the Manhattan Campus before Hurricane Irene was New York City's (NYC's) hospital-evacuation mandate. As a federal facility, the Manhattan VA medical center (VAMC) was exempt from the city's order, but decision makers felt compelled to comply. In the case of Superstorm Sandy, corporate memory of a similar 1992 storm that crippled the Manhattan facility drove the decision to evacuate before the storm hit.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that hospital-evacuation decisions are confounded by political considerations and are influenced by past disaster experience. Greater shared situational awareness among at-risk hospitals, along with a more coordinated approach to evacuation decision making, could reduce pressure on hospitals to make these high-stakes decisions. Systematic mechanisms for collecting, documenting, and sharing lessons learned from past disasters are sorely needed at the institutional, local, and national levels.}

Three hundred and ninety-four students participated in the study; 77{\%} completed the post-intervention questionnaire. The intervention consisted of a "Safer Sex Workshop" where the following topics were discussed: Aids symbolism, risk perception, influences of gender norms on attitudes, Aids-related knowledge, erotic and reproductive body, sexual pleasure, and condom use negotiation. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's Chi-square test and variance.RESULTS: The frequency of condom use was low (33{\%}). There were significant gender differences concerning sexuality and AIDS prevention. Workshop evaluation showed a statistically significant impact on women, who improved chiefly their attitudes regarding safer sex. Changes were not significant among men.CONCLUSIONS: HIV risk infection can be lowered but more significant results can be achieved if gender differences and sexual scripts are taken into account while developing specific long-term community programs.}

The prostatic expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (betaFGF) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were detected by immunohistochemistry assay. Prostatic levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory-related factors were also analyzed. Additionally, the prostatic expressions of androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, ER-beta, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, B-cell CLL/lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were measured by western blot. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated factors were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. It showed that QYD and swertiamarin ameliorated the testosterone-induced prostatic hyperplasia and collagen deposition, attenuated the over-expressions of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, EGF, betaFGF, PCNA, AR and ER-alpha, reduced the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, enhanced the expression of ER-beta, inhibited the oxidative stress and local inflammation, as well as relieved prostatic EMT.

 abstract     = {alpha2A adrenergic receptor (alpha2A-AR) activation has been shown in animal models to play an important role in regulating the balance of acute pain inhibition vs facilitation after both physical and psychological stress. To our knowledge, the influence of genetic variants in the gene encoding alpha2A-AR, ADRA2A, on acute pain outcomes in humans experiencing traumatic stress has not been assessed. In this study, we tested whether a genetic variant in the 3'UTR of ADRA2A, rs3750625, is associated with acute musculoskeletal pain (MSP) severity following motor vehicle collision (MVC, n = 948) and sexual assault (n = 84), and whether this influence was affected by stress severity. We evaluated rs3750625 because it is located in the seed binding region of miR-34a, a microRNA (miRNA) known to regulate pain and stress responses. In both cohorts, the minor allele at rs3750625 was associated with increased musculoskeletal pain in distressed individuals (stress*rs3750625 P = 0.043 for MVC cohort and P = 0.007 for sexual assault cohort). We further found that (1) miR-34a binds the 3'UTR of ADRA2A, (2) the amount of repression is greater when the minor (risk) allele is present, (3) miR-34a in the IMR-32 adrenergic neuroblastoma cell line affects ADRA2A expression, (4) miR-34a and ADRA2A are expressed in tissues known to play a role in pain and stress, (5) following forced swim stress exposure, rat peripheral nerve tissue expression changes are consistent with miR-34a regulation of ADRA2A. Together, these results suggest that ADRA2A rs3750625 contributes to poststress musculoskeletal pain severity by modulating miR-34a regulation.}

We aimed to determine the drivers predisposing to unfavorable PC outcomes anticipated by BCR events among patients of similar preoperative characteristics. The TCGA transcriptomic and clinical data of 497 PC individuals were used, stratified according to the risk of BCR by EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-SIOG. The relevance of the functional markers regarding BCR-free survival was examined by the cutp algorithm. Through UpSetR, subgroups of PC patients bearing an unfavorable signature were identified, followed by the hierarchical clustering of the major markers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). BCR-free survival was estimated with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. ESR1 significantly differentiated BCR-free survival, whereas AR did not. An elevation in KLK3 correlated with better prognosis, although PGR, KLK3, CDH1, and MMP3 predicted BCR better than the preoperative PSA level. Patients sharing an unfavorable profile of ESR1 and MMP3 together with lymph node status, Gleason score, T, and EAU risk groups were at a higher risk of BCR originating from mesenchymal features of PC cells. To conclude, we revealed an ESR1-driven unfavorable profile of EMT underpinning a worse PC trajectory. ESR1 may have a major role in PC progression; therefore, it could become a major focus for further investigations.}

Using 478 PCa samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, four molecular subtypes (S-I, S-II, S-III, and S-IV) were identified and validated in two merged microarray and RNAseq datasets with 656 and 252 samples, respectively. Interestingly, the four subtypes showed distinct clinical and biological features after comprehensive analyses of clinical features, multiomic profiles, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. S-I is basal/stem/mesenchymal-like and immune-excluded with marked transforming growth factor beta, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and hypoxia signals, increased sensitivity to olaparib, and intermediate prognosis. S-II is luminal/metabolism-active and responsive to androgen deprivation therapy with frequent TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and a good prognosis. S-III is characterized by moderate proliferative and metabolic activity, sensitivity to taxane-based chemotherapy, and intermediate prognosis. S-IV is highly proliferative with moderate EMT and stemness, frequent deletions of TP53, PTEN and RB, and the poorest prognosis; it is also immune-inflamed and sensitive to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Overall, based on miRNA-regulated gene profiles, this study identified four distinct PCa subtypes that could improve risk stratification at diagnosis and provide therapeutic guidance.}

 abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating and frequent type of primary brain tumor with high morbidity and mortality. Despite the use of surgical resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy as standard therapy, the progression of GBM remains dismal with a median overall survival of <15 months. GBM embodies a populace of cancer stem cells (GSCs) that is associated with tumor initiation, invasion, therapeutic resistance, and post-treatment reoccurrence. However, understanding the potential mechanisms of stemness and their candidate biomarkers remains limited. Hence in this investigation, we aimed to illuminate potential candidate hub genes and key pathways associated with the pathogenesis of GSC in the development of GBM. The integrated analysis discovered differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the brain cancer tissues (GBM and GSC) and normal brain tissues. Multiple approaches, including gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, were employed to functionally annotate the DEGs and visualize them through the R program. The significant hub genes were identified through the protein-protein interaction network, Venn diagram analysis, and survival analysis. We observed that the upregulated DEGs were prominently involved in the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. The downregulated genes were mainly associated with the axon guidance pathway. Five significant hub genes (CTNNB1, ITGB1, TNC, EGFR, and SHOX2) were screened out through multiple analyses. GO and KEGG analyses of hub genes uncovered that these genes were primarily enriched in disease-associated pathways such as the inhibition of apoptosis and the DNA damage repair mechanism, activation of the cell cycle, EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), hormone AR (androgen receptor), hormone ER (estrogen receptor), PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT), RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase), and TSC/mTOR (tuberous sclerosis complex and mammalian target of rapamycin). Consequently, the epigenetic regulatory network disclosed that hub genes played a vital role in the progression of GBM. Finally, candidate drugs were predicted that can be used as possible drugs to treat GBM patients. Overall, our investigation offered five hub genes (CTNNB1, ITGB1, TNC, EGFR, and SHOX2) that could be used as precise diagnostic and prognostic candidate biomarkers of GBM and might be used as personalized therapeutic targets to obstruct gliomagenesis.}

 abstract     = {AIMS: Hormone receptors are the main markers applied for prognosis of breast cancer subtypes. Among modulators, exogenous chemical agents known as endocrine disruptors interact with certain receptors, triggering molecular pathways or increasing their expression. Bisphenol A (BPA), a xenoestrogen, interacts with several hormone receptors. Thus, our aim was to characterize the hormone receptor status in the mammary gland (MG) of aged female Mongolian gerbils exposed to BPA in pregnancy and lactation.METHODS: We evaluated the expression of receptors for estrogens (ERalpha and ERbeta), progesterone (PR), prolactin (PRL-R), HER2/ErbB2, and androgen (AR) in normal and hyperplastic mammary tissue and in carcinomas developed after BPA exposure.KEY FINDINGS: BPA-exposed MG presented increased ERalpha, whereas ERbeta, PR, and PRL-R showed lower expression. AR and HER2/ErbB2 showed similar expression in normal and hyperplastic tissue from control, vehicle, and BPA groups. Both receptors were found in cytoplasm and nucleus in BPA-induced carcinoma. We demonstrate the presence of EZH2 expression, an epigenetic and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, with a high H-score in BPA-exposed MG, which was associated with poor prognosis of cancer. Co-localization of ERalpha and EZH2 was present in normal and carcinoma features, corroborating the installation of ERalpha-positive mammary cancer associated with the EMT process. Enhanced EZH2 in BPA-exposed mammary tissue could decrease ERbeta expression and promote tumorigenesis progress through HER2/ErbB2.SIGNIFICANCE: The present study proposes the Mongolian gerbil as an experimental model for mammary carcinogenesis studies, based on BPA disruption that triggers a phenotype of increased ERalpha/HER2 positivity and depletion of ERbeta/PR expression.}

 abstract     = {In this study, we explore the therapeutic potential of lapatinib a selective inhibitor of both the EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinases for the treatment of endometrial cancer. The effect of lapatinib on tumour cell growth and receptor activation was studied in a panel of human endometrial cancer cell lines. Candidate molecular markers predicting sensitivity were assessed by baseline gene expression profiling, ELISA, and western blot analyses. Multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis was used to study the interactions between chemotherapeutic drugs and lapatinib. Concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects of lapatinib were seen in all endometrial cancer cell lines tested, but varied significantly between individual cell lines (IC(50) range: 0.052-10.9 micromol). HER2 overexpression or increased expression of EGFR was significantly associated with in vitro sensitivity (P=0.024 or 0.011, respectively). Lapatinib exerts growth inhibition in a PTEN-independent manner. Sensitive cell lines also exhibited increased expression of EGFR ligands or HER3. In contrast, lapatinib-resistant cell lines exhibited high androgen receptor (AR) levels or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (post-EMT) features. In endometrial cancer cells, at a wide range of clinically achievable drug concentrations, additive and synergistic interactions were observed for lapatinib plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and doxorubicin. These observations provide a clear biologic rational to test lapatinib as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in endometrial cancer with HER2 overexpression. Expression of EGFR, its ligands, HER3, AR, and post-EMT markers warrant further evaluation to help define patients with HER2-nonoverexpressing endometrial cancer most likely to benefit from lapatinib.}

For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, noninvasive serial measurements of bloodborne cells may provide a means to tailor therapeutic decisions based on an individual patient's response. Here, we used a high-sensitivity profiling approach to monitor CTCs in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing treatment with abiraterone and enzalutamide, two drugs used to treat advanced prostate cancer. The capture and profiling approach uses antibody-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles to sort cells according to protein expression levels. CTCs are tagged with magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to an antibody specific for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and sorted into four zones of a microfluidic device based on EpCAM expression levels. Our approach was compared to the FDA-cleared CellSearch method, and we demonstrate significantly higher capture efficiency of low-EpCAM cells compared to the commercial method. The nanoparticle-based approach detected CTCs from 86{\%} of patients at baseline, compared to CellSearch which only detected CTCs from 60{\%} of patients. Patients were stratified as prostate specific antigen (PSA) progressive versus responsive based on clinically acceptable definitions, and it was observed that patients with a limited response to therapy had elevated levels of androgen receptor variant 7 (ARV7) and the mesenchymal marker, N-cadherin, expressed on their CTCs. In addition, these CTCs exhibited lower EpCAM expression. The results highlight features of CTCs associated with disease progression on abiraterone or enzalutamide, including mesenchymal phenotypes and increased expression levels of ARV7. The use of a high-sensitivity method to capture and profile CTCs provides more informative data concerning the phenotypic properties of these cells as patients undergo treatment relative to an FDA-cleared method.}

Previously, we found that plasma exosomal miR-375 is significantly elevated in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) patients compared with castration-sensitive PCa patients. Here, we aimed to determine how miR-375 modulates CRPC progression and thereafter to evaluate the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hucMSC)-derived exosomes loaded with miR-375 antisense oligonucleotides (e-375i). We used miRNA in situ hybridization technique to evaluate miR-375 expression in PCa tissues, gain- and loss-of-function experiments to determine miR-375 function, and bioinformatic methods, dual-luciferase reporter assay, qPCR, IHC and western blotting to determine and validate the target as well as the effects of miR-375 at the molecular level. Then, e-375i complexes were assessed for their antagonizing effects against miR-375. We found that the expression of miR-375 was elevated in PCa tissues and cancer exosomes, correlating with the Gleason score. Forced expression of miR-375 enhanced the expression of EMT markers and AR but suppressed apoptosis markers, leading to enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion, and enzalutamide resistance and decreased apoptosis of PCa cells. These effects could be reversed by miR-375 silencing. Mechanistically, miR-375 directly interfered with the expression of phosphatase nonreceptor type 4 (PTPN4), which in turn stabilized phosphorylated STAT3. Application of e-375i could inhibit miR-375, upregulate PTPN4 and downregulate p-STAT3, eventually repressing the growth of PCa. Collectively, we identified a novel miR-375 target, PTPN4, that functions upstream of STAT3, and targeting miR-375 may be an alternative therapeutic for PCa, especially for CRPC with high AR levels.}

However, recent studies have shown increased osteolytic activity in the beginning stages of PCa bone metastases, suggesting that targeting both osteolytic and osteoblastic mediators would likely inhibit bone remodeling and PCa bone metastasis. In this study, we found that PCa cells could stimulate differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts through the up-regulation of RANKL, RUNX2 and osteopontin, promoting bone remodeling. Interestingly, we found that formulated isoflavone and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (BR-DIM) were able to inhibit the differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts through the inhibition of cell signal transduction in RANKL, osteoblastic, and PCa cell signaling. Moreover, we found that isoflavone and BR-DIM down-regulated the expression of miR-92a, which is known to be associated with RANKL signaling, EMT and cancer progression. By pathway and network analysis, we also observed the regulatory effects of isoflavone and BR-DIM on multiple signaling pathways such as AR/PSA, NKX3-1/Akt/p27, MITF, etc. Therefore, isoflavone and BR-DIM with their multi-targeted effects could be useful for the prevention of PCa progression, especially by attenuating bone metastasis mechanisms.}

 abstract     = {SPOP, an adaptor protein for E3 ubiquitin ligase can function as a tumor-suppressor or a tumor-enhancer. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), it inhibits tumorigenesis by degrading many oncogenic targets, including androgen receptor (AR). Expectedly, SPOP is the most commonly mutated gene in CRPC (15{\%}), which closely correlates with poor prognosis. Importantly, 85{\%} of tumors that retain wild-type SPOP show reduced protein levels, indicating that SPOP downregulation is an essential step in CRPC progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. This study uncovered the first mechanism of SPOP regulation in any type of cancer. We identified SPOP as a direct substrate of Aurora A (AURKA) using an innovative technique. AURKA directly phosphorylates SPOP at three sites, causing its ubiquitylation. SPOP degradation drives highly aggressive oncogenic phenotypes in cells and in vivo including stabilizing AR, ARv7 and c-Myc. Further, SPOP degrades AURKA via a feedback loop. SPOP upregulation is one of the mechanisms by which enzalutamide exerts its efficacy. Consequently, phospho-resistant SPOP fully abrogates tumorigenesis and EMT in vivo, and renders CRPC cells sensitive to enzalutamide. While genomic mutations of SPOP can be treated with gene therapy, identification of AURKA as an upstream regulator of SPOP provides a powerful opportunity for retaining WT-SPOP in a vast majority of CRPC patients using AURKA inhibitors {\textpm} enzalutamide, thereby treating the disease and inhibiting its progression.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in men worldwide. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has proven effective in early-stage androgen-sensitive disease, but prostate cancer gradually develops into an androgen-resistant metastatic state in the vast majority of patients. According to our oncogene-induced model for cancer development, senescence is a major tumor progression barrier. However, whether senescence is implicated in the progression of early-stage androgen-sensitive to highly aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains poorly addressed.METHODS: Androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (C4-2B and PC-3) cells were treated or not with enzalutamide, an Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitor. RNA sequencing and pathway analyses were carried out in LNCaP cells to identify potential senescence regulators upon treatment. Assessment of the invasive potential of cells and senescence status following enzalutamide treatment and/or RNAi-mediated silencing of selected targets was performed in all cell lines, complemented by bioinformatics analyses on a wide range of in vitro and in vivo datasets. Key observations were validated in LNCaP and C4-2B mouse xenografts. Senescence induction was assessed by state-of-the-art GL13 staining by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy.RESULTS: We demonstrate that enzalutamide treatment induces senescence in androgen-sensitive cells via reduction of the replication licensing factor CDC6. Mechanistically, we show that CDC6 downregulation is mediated through endogenous activation of the GATA2 transcription factor functioning as a CDC6 repressor. Intriguingly, GATA2 levels decrease in enzalutamide-resistant cells, leading to CDC6 stabilization accompanied by activation of Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers and absence of senescence. We show that CDC6 loss is sufficient to reverse oncogenic features and induce senescence regardless of treatment responsiveness, thereby identifying CDC6 as a critical determinant of prostate cancer progression.CONCLUSIONS: We identify a key GATA2-CDC6 signaling axis which is reciprocally regulated in enzalutamide-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer environments. Upon acquired resistance, GATA2 repression leads to CDC6 stabilization, with detrimental effects in disease progression through exacerbation of EMT and abrogation of senescence. However, bypassing the GATA2-CDC6 axis by direct inhibition of CDC6 reverses oncogenic features and establishes senescence, thereby offering a therapeutic window even after acquiring resistance to therapy.}

 abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel pedestrian indoor positioning system that uses sensor fusion between a foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a vision-based fiducial marker tracking system. The goal is to provide an after-action review for first responders during training exercises. The main contribution of this work comes from the observation that different walking types (e.g., forward walking, sideways walking, backward walking) lead to different levels of position and heading error. Our approach takes this into account when accumulating the error, thereby leading to more-accurate estimations. Through experimentation, we show the variation in error accumulation and the improvement in accuracy alter when and how often to activate the camera tracking system, leading to better balance between accuracy and power consumption overall. The IMU and vision-based systems are loosely coupled using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to ensure accurate and unobstructed positioning computation. The motion model of the EKF is derived from the foot-mounted IMU data and the measurement model from the vision system. Existing indoor positioning systems for training exercises require extensive active infrastructure installation, which is not viable for exercises taking place in a remote area. With the use of passive infrastructure (i.e., fiducial markers), the positioning system can accurately track user position over a longer duration of time and can be easily integrated into the environment. We evaluated our system on an indoor trajectory of 250 m. Results show that even with discrete corrections, near a meter level of accuracy can be achieved. Our proposed system attains the positioning accuracy of 0.55 m for a forward walk, 1.05 m for a backward walk, and 1.68 m for a sideways walk with a 90{\%} confidence level.}

Comparison of ACE inhibitor Trandolapril (0.1 mg/kg/day), ETAR antagonist BMS 182874 (30 mg/kg/day) and ETAR/ETBR antagonist Ro 46-2005 (30 mg/kg/day) by gavage. Duration of the experiment eight weeks.METHODS: Systolic blood pressure by tail plethysmography. Perfusion fixation of kidneys and morphometric analysis ET-1 and ETA/ETBR by quantitative PCR.RESULTS: SNX caused a significant (P < 0.01) increase of systolic blood pressure (170 +/- 8.6 mmHg) compared to sham operated controls (131 +/- 5.3 mmHg). Blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.001) lower with Trandolapril (128 +/- 5.3 mmHg), but not with BMS 182874 (153 +/- 5.9 mmHg) or Ro 46-2005 (167 +/- 7.6 mmHg). Compared to sham operated rats (0.03 +/- 0.01) glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the untreated SNX group (0.9 +/- 0.15). Significantly lower GSI was found in Trandolapril treated (0.29 +/- 0.04), BMS 182874 treated (0.36 +/- 0.05), and Ro 46-2005 treated animals (0.45 +/- 0.11). The effect of BMS 182874 was accompanied by lower tubulointerstitial damage index. Mean glomerular volume was dramatically increased (P < 0.001) in SNX rats as compared to sham operated animals. This glomerular enlargement was partially prevented by Trandolapril (P < 0.05), but not by either ETR antagonist. ET-1 mRNA tended to be higher in SNX irrespective of treatment, while ETAR and ETBR mRNA were significantly lower.CONCLUSION: Both specific (ETAR) and non-specific (ETA/ETBR) endothelin antagonists interfere with development of glomerulosclerosis by mechanisms which are, at least in part, independent of systemic blood pressure.}

Cellular, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression and hormone resistance are poorly understood. Studies have investigated the local effects of gonadotropin‑releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs (used for androgen deprivation treatments) and the presence of the GnRH receptor (GnRH‑R) on PCa cells. Furthermore, cell subpopulations with stem‑like properties, or cancer stem cells, have been isolated and characterized using a cell culture system derived from explants of human prostate tumors. In addition, the development of preclinical orthotopic models of human PCa in a nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model of compromised immunity has enabled the establishment of a reproducible system of metastatic progression invivo. There is increasing evidence that metastasis is a complex process involving the cooperative actions of different cancer cell subpopulations, in which cancer stem‑like cells would be responsible for the final step of colonizing premetastatic niches. It has been hypothesized that PCa cells with stemness and mesenchymal signatures act cooperatively in metastatic progression and the inhibition of stemness genes, and that overexpression of androgen receptor (AR) and GnRH‑R decreases the rate the metastasis and sensitizes tumors to hormone therapy. The aim of the present review is to analyze the evidence regarding this cooperative process and the possible influence of stem‑like cell phenotypes, AR and GnRH‑R in metastatic progression and hormone resistance. These aspects may represent an important contribution in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying metastasis and hormone resistance in PCa, and potential routes to blocking these processes, enabling the development of novel therapies that would be particularly relevant for patients with metastatic and castration‑resistant PCa.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Immune activation is a significant contributor to HIV pathogenesis and disease progression. In virally-suppressed individuals on ART, low-level immune activation has been linked to several non-infectious comorbid diseases. However, studies have not been systematically performed in sub-Saharan Africa and thus the impact of demographics, ART and regional endemic co-infections on immune activation is not known. We therefore comprehensively evaluated in a large multinational African cohort markers for immune activation and its distribution in various settings.METHODS: 2747 specimens from 2240 people living with HIV (PLWH) and 477 without HIV from the observational African Cohort Study (AFRICOS) were analyzed for 13 immune parameters. Samples were collected along with medical history, sociodemographic and comorbidity data at 12 HIV clinics across 5 programs in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria. Data were analyzed with univariate and multivariate methods such as random forests and principal component analysis.FINDINGS: Immune activation was markedly different between PLWH with detectable viral loads, and individuals without HIV across sites. Among viremic PLWH, we found that all immune parameters were significantly correlated with viral load except for IFN-alpha. The overall inflammatory profile was distinct between men and women living with HIV, in individuals off ART and with HIV viremia. We observed stronger differences in the immune activation profile with increasing viremia. Using machine learning methods, we found that geographic differences contributed to unique inflammatory profiles. We also found that among PLWH, age and the presence of infectious and/or noninfectious comorbidities showed distinct inflammatory patterns, and biomarkers may be used to predict the presence of some comorbidities.INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that chronic immune activation in HIV-1 infection is influenced by HIV viral load, sex, age, region and ART use. These predictors, as well as associations among some biomarkers and coinfections, influence biomarkers associated with noncommunicable diseases.FUNDING: This work was supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief via a cooperative agreement between the Henry M.

 abstract     = {Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) plays an important role in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It is necessary to establish a genetic signature associated with AKR1C3 that can be used to predict the prognosis of PCa patients and provide important information for clinical treatment decisions. AKR1C3-related genes were identified via label-free quantitative proteomics of the AKR1C3-overexpressing LNCaP cell line. A risk model was constructed through the analysis of clinical data, PPI, and Cox-selected risk genes. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to verify the accuracy of the model, and two external datasets were used to verify the reliability of the results. Subsequently, the tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivity were explored. Moreover, the roles of AKR1C3 in the progression of PCa were verified in LNCaP cells. MTT, colony formation, and EdU assays were conducted to explore cell proliferation and drug sensitivity to enzalutamide. Migration and invasion abilities were measured using wound-healing and transwell assays, and qPCR was used to assess the expression levels of AR target genes and EMT genes. CDC20, SRSF3, UQCRH, INCENP, TIMM10, TIMM13, POLR2L, and NDUFAB1 were identified as AKR1C3-associated risk genes. These risk genes, established using the prognostic model, can effectively predict the recurrence status, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity of PCa. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and several immune checkpoints that promote cancer progression were higher in high-risk groups. Furthermore, there was a close correlation between the sensitivity of PCa patients to bicalutamide and docetaxel and the expression levels of the eight risk genes. Moreover, through in vitro experiments, Western blotting confirmed that AKR1C3 enhanced SRSF3, CDC20, and INCENP expression. We found that PCa cells with a high expression of AKR1C3 have high proliferation ability and high migration ability and were insensitive to enzalutamide. AKR1C3-associated genes had a significant role in the process of PCa, immune responses, and drug sensitivity and offer the potential for a novel model for prognostic prediction in PCa.}

In this study, mic, a lesion mimic mutant from cultivar Yunyin treated with ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS), was screened. By map-based cloning, a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase with an atypical active site HxxxK was isolated and designated as SDR7-6. It functions as a homomultimer in rice and is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. The lesion mimic phenotype of the mutant is light-dependent. The mutant displayed an increased resistance response to bacterial blight, but reduced resistance to rice blast disease. The mutant and knockout lines showed increased reactive oxygen species, jasmonic acid content, antioxidant enzyme activity, and expression of pathogenicity-related genes, while chlorophyll content was significantly reduced. The knockout lines showed significant reduction in grain size, seed setting rate, 1000-grain weight, grain weight per plant, panicle length, and plant height. SDR7-6 is a new lesion mimic gene that encodes a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase with atypical catalytic site. Disruption of SDR7-6 led to cell death and had adverse effects on multiple agricultural characters. SDR7-6 may act at the interface of the two defence pathways of bacterial blight and rice blast disease in rice.}

However, the role of DNAJC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was unclear.Methods: In this study, expression and prognostic value of DNAJC1 in HCC were analyzed by bioinformatics. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to verify DNAJC1 expression in liver cancer cell lines. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) was used to detect DNAJC1 expression in liver cancer tissues. Subsequently, the effect of DNAJC1 on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of HCC cells was detected by knocking down DNAJC1. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the potential mechanism of DNAJC1 and was verified by Western blotting.Results: DNAJC1 was highly expressed in HCC and was significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC. Importantly, the proliferation, migration and invasion of Huh7 and MHCC97H cells were inhibited by the knockdown of DNAJC1 and the knockdown of DNAJC1 promoted Huh7 and MHCC97H cell apoptosis. Furthermore, compared to the negative control group, DNAJC1 knockdown in Huh7 and MHCC97H cells promoted the expression of p21, p53, p-p53(Ser20), Bax and E-cadherin proteins, while inhibiting the expression of PARP, MMP9, Vimentin, Snai1, Bcl-2 and N-cadherin proteins.Conclusions: DNAJC1 had a predictive value for the prognosis of HCC. Knockdown of DNAJC1 may inhibit HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and promote the HCC cell apoptosis through p53 and EMT signaling pathways.}

Consistent with in vivo growth rates, in 3D cultures, all PCa cell-lines were found to proliferate at significantly lower rates in comparison to their 2D counterparts. Moreover, when grown in a 3D matrix, metastatic PC3 cell-lines were found to mimic more precisely protein expression patterns of metastatic tumour formation as found in vivo. In comparison to the prostate epithelial cell-line RWPE-1, metastatic PC3 cell-lines exhibited a down-regulation of E-cadherin and alpha6 integrin expression and an up-regulation of N-cadherin, Vimentin and beta1 integrin expression and re-expressed non-transcriptionally active AR. In comparison to the non-invasive LNCaP cell-lines, PC3 cells were found to have an up-regulation of chemokine receptor CXCR4, consistent with a metastatic phenotype. In 2D cultures, there was little distinction in protein expression between metastatic, non-invasive and epithelial cells. These results suggest that 3D cultures are more representative of in vivo morphology and may serve as a more biologically relevant model in the drug discovery pipeline.}

However, there are only very few conditions enhancing concomitant dependence and personality disorder to the rank of a mental disease according to German guardianship legislation. If the patient's condition meets the criteria of a psychic disease and endangers his own health and public safety, commitment to a mental hospital or guardianship are justified. The purpose of this clinical analysis was to compare the medical proposal for treatment with legal prerequisites which are indispensable for involuntary admission to a mental hospital. Whereas the Psychiatric Disorders Act intends to avert danger to the public, guardianship legislation aims at individual help. We present a patient who suffered from alcoholism and simultaneously met criteria of a serious personality disorder, which was classified according to ICD-10 (F 60.31). As the aggravation of the symptoms was most likely to entail serious danger to his health the judge ordered immediate involuntary admission. Two other patients had similar comorbidity but had to be released from hospital because of finalisation of detoxification. Neither dependence nor personality disorder were pronounced enough to restrict the rights of the individual. Our analysis shows that the psychiatrist must present with an expert medical report that quantifies the extent of alcoholism and personality disorder and characterises them as psychic disease. Consequently, for the purpose of quantifying the extent of dependence, we recommend to apply the European Addiction Severity Index whose suitability should be assessed.}

The identification of thyroid cancer cases (216) was carried out by linking the SRU data-base with the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine (NCRU) data. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) were estimatedcomparing thyroid cancer incidence in the cohort with the corresponding national indices. Excess absolute risk(EAR), excess relative risk (ERR) and attributable fraction of risk (AR) were calculated accounting for the alterna-tive dose estimates. The following sources of the average dose values for Ukrainian liquidators were used: officialtotal external dose records according to UNSCEAR 2008 report and results of external red bone marrow dose recon-struction by the RADRUE method for the cohort sample. For the radiation risk evaluation, these estimates were con-versed to the average external thyroid dose.RESULTS: Results of the long term study (1986-2012) of thyroid cancer risks in a cohort of 150813 Chornobyl clean-up workers (liquidators) from Ukraine are presented. Two options for the average thyroid dose estimates were usedfor radiation risks evaluation. According to the SRU and NCRU 216 incident thyroid cancers were diagnosed in 1986-2012 within the studied cohort with an overall SIR of 3.35 (95 {\%} confidence interval (CI) 2.51-3.80). The SIR esti-mates were elevated throughout the entire follow-up period. Investigation of a contribution of the external expo-sure (according to the alternative values) showed the elevated dose associated thyroid cancer rates in the studiedcohort. Alternatively estimated EAR/104 PY Gy were of 1.86 (95 {\%} CI 0.47-3.24) and 2.07 (95 {\%} CI 0.53-3.62);ERR/Gy - 2.38 (95 {\%} CI 0.60-4.15) and 2.66 (95 {\%} CI 0.68-4.64) and AR {\%} (Gy) 70.4 {\%} and 72.7 {\%} Gy.CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results prove the dose dependent increase of thyroid cancer incidence among UkrainianChornobyl clean-up workers. These conclusions are consistent with those received for combined cohort of Belarus,Russia and Baltic States liquidators.}

 abstract     = {Steroid hormone receptors (SRs) are classically defined as ligand-activated transcription factors that function as master regulators of gene programs important for a wide range of processes governing adult physiology, development, and cell or tissue homeostasis. A second function of SRs includes the ability to activate cytoplasmic signaling pathways. Estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and progesterone (PR) receptors bind directly to membrane-associated signaling molecules including mitogenic protein kinases (i.e. c-SRC and AKT), G-proteins, and ion channels to mediate context-dependent actions via rapid activation of downstream signaling pathways. In addition to making direct contact with diverse signaling molecules, SRs are further fully integrated with signaling pathways by virtue of their N-terminal phosphorylation sites that act as regulatory hot-spots capable of sensing the signaling milieu. In particular, ER, AR, PR, and closely related glucocorticoid receptors (GR) share the property of accepting (i.e. sensing) ligand-independent phosphorylation events by proline-directed kinases in the MAPK and CDK families. These signaling inputs act as a 'second ligand' that dramatically impacts cell fate. In the face of drugs that reliably target SR ligand-binding domains to block uncontrolled cancer growth, ligand-independent post-translational modifications guide changes in cell fate that confer increased survival, EMT, migration/invasion, stemness properties, and therapy resistance of non-proliferating SR+ cancer cell subpopulations. The focus of this review is on MAPK pathways in the regulation of SR+ cancer cell fate. MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of PR (Ser294) and GR (Ser134) will primarily be discussed in light of the need to target changes in breast cancer cell fate as part of modernized combination therapies.}

The investigation of milder cases, as suggested by recent reports remains controversial.METHODS: Integrated clinical, hormonal and genetic screening was performed in a sequential series of 46, XY children, sex-assigned male, who were referred to our pediatric endocrine service for atypical genitalia (2007-2013).RESULTS: A consecutive cohort of undervirilized 46,XY children with external masculinization score (EMS) 2-12, was extensively investigated. In four patients, a clinical diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome or Mowat-Wilson syndrome was made and genetically supported in 2/3 and 1/1 cases respectively. Hormonal data were suggestive of a (dihydro)testosterone biosynthesis disorder in four cases, however no HSD17B3 or SRD5A2 mutations were found. Array-CGH revealed a causal structural variation in 2/6 syndromic patients. In addition, three novel NR5A1 mutations were found in non-syndromic patients. Interestingly, one mutation was present in a fertile male, underlining the inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability of NR5A1-associated phenotypes. No AR, SRY or WT1 mutations were identified.CONCLUSION: Overall, a genetic diagnosis could be established in 19{\%} of non-syndromic and 33{\%} of syndromic cases. There is no difference in diagnostic yield between patients with more or less pronounced phenotypes, as expressed by the external masculinisation score (EMS). The clinical utility of array-CGH is high in syndromic cases. Finally, a sequential gene-by-gene approach is time-consuming, expensive and inefficient. Given the low yield and high expense of Sanger sequencing, we anticipate that massively parallel sequencing of gene panels and whole exome sequencing hold promise for genetic diagnosis of 46,XY DSD boys with an undervirilized phenotype.}

 abstract     = {The published literature that addresses the many facets of pharmaceutical ingredients as environmental contaminants has grown exponentially since the 1990s. Although there are several thousand active ingredients used in medical pharmaceuticals worldwide, illicit drug ingredients (IDIs) have generally been excluded from consideration. Medicinal and illicit drugs have been treated separately in environmental research even though they pose many of the same concerns regarding the potential for both human and ecological exposure. The overview presented here covers the state of knowledge up until mid-2010 regarding the origin, occurrence, fate, and potential for biological effects of IDIs in the environment. Similarities exist with medical pharmaceuticals, particularly with regard to the basic processes by which these ingredients enter the environment--excretion of unmetabolized residues (including via sweat), bathing, disposal, and manufacturing. The features of illicit drugs that distinguish them from medical pharmaceuticals are discussed. Demarcations between the two are not always clear, and a certain degree of overlap adds additional confusion as to what exactly defines an illicit drug; indeed, medical pharmaceuticals diverted from the legal market or used for non-medicinal purposes ar also captured in discussions of illicit drugs. Also needing consideration as par tof the universe of IDIs are the numerous adulterants and synthesis impurities often encountered in these very impure preparations. many of these extraneous chemicals have high biological activity themselves. In contract to medical pharmaceuticals, comparatively little is know about the fate and effects of IDIs in the environment. Environmental surveys for IDIs have revealed their presence in sewage wastewaters, raw sewage sludge and processed sludge (biosolids), and drinking water. Nearly nothing is known, however, regarding wildlife exposure to IDIs, especially aquatic exposure such as indicated by bioconcentration i tissues. In contrast to pharmaceuticals, chemical monitoring surveys have revealed the presence of certain IDIs in air and monetary currencies--the latter being of interest for the forensic tracking of money used in drug trafficking. Another unknown with regard to IDIs is the accuracy of current knowledge regarding the complete scope of chemical identities of the numerous types of IDIs in actual use (particularly some of the continually evolving designer drugs new to forensic chemistry) as well as the total quantities being trafficked, consumed, or disposed. The major aspect unique to the study of IDI's in the environment is making use of their presence in the environment as a tool to obtain better estimates of the collective usage of illicit drugs across entire communities. First proposed in 2001, but under investigation with field applications only since 2005, this new modeling approach for estimating drug usage by monitoring the concentrations of IDIs (or certain unique metabolites) in untreated sewage has potential as an additional source of data to augment or corroborate the information-collection ability of conventional written and oral surveys of drug-user populations. This still evolving monitoring tool has been called "sewer epidemiology" but is referred to in this chapter by a more descriptive proposed term "FEUDS" (Forensic Epidemiology Using Drugs in Sewage). The major limitation of FEUDS surrounds the variables involved at various steps performed in FEUDS calculations. These variables are summarized and span sampling and chemical analysis to the final numeric calculations, which particularly require a better understanding of IDI pharmacokinetics than currently exists. Although little examined in the literature, the potential for abuse of FEUDS as a tool in law enforcement is briefly discussed. Finally, the growing interest in FEUDS as a methodological approach for estimating collective public usage of illicit drugs points to the feasibility of mining other types of chemical information from sewage. On the horizon is the potential for "sewage information mining" (SIM) as a general approach for measuring a nearly limitless array of biochemical markers that could serve as collective indicators of the specific or general status of public health or disease at the community-wide level. SIM may create the opportunity to view communities from a new perspective--"communities as the patient." This could potentially lead to the paradigm of combining human and ecological communities as a single patient--as an interconnected whole.}

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Disruption of the phenotypic landscape via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables prostate cancer cells to metastasize and acquire therapeutic resistance. Our previous studies demonstrated that cabazitaxel (CBZ) (second-generation Food and Drug Administration-approved taxane chemotherapy), used for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), causes reversal of EMT to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and reduces expression of kinesin motor protein KIFC1 (HSET). The present study examined the effect of sequencing CBZ chemotherapy mediated MET on prostate tumor redifferentiation overcoming therapeutic resistance in models of advanced prostate cancer.METHODS: To examine the impact of androgens on the antitumor effect of CBZ, we used human prostate cancer cell lines with different sensitivity to androgens and CBZ, in vitro, and two human prostate cancer xenograft models in vivo. Tumor-bearing male mice (with either the androgen-sensitive LNCaP or the CRPC 22Rv1 xenografts) were treated with CBZ (3mg/kg) alone, or in combination with castration-induced androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for 14 days.RESULTS: Cell viability assays indicate that the presence of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (1nM) confers resistance to CBZ in vitro. CBZ treatment in vivo induced MET in LNCaP-derived tumors as shown by increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin levels. Sequencing CBZ after ADT improves tumor response in androgen-sensitive LNCaP, but not in CRPC 22Rv1 xenografts. Mechanistic dissection revealed a novel association between the androgen receptor and HSET in prostate cancer cells that is inhibited by CBZ in an androgen-dependent manner.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the phenotypic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells to resensitize tumors to CBZ action. This evidence is of translational significance in treatment sequencing (CBZ and ADT) towards improved therapeutic benefit in patients with lethal CRPC.}

 abstract     = {Healthcare acquired infections are no longer confined to the hospital environment. Recently, many reported outbreaks have been linked to outpatient settings and attributed to non-adherence to recommended infection-prevention procedures. This study was divided into two parts: The first is a descriptive cross-sectional part, to assess the healthcare personnel's knowledge and compliance with Standard Precautions (SP). The second is an intervention part to assess the role of health education on reducing the level of environmental and reusable medical equipment bacterial contamination. Assessment of the doctors' and nurses' knowledge and compliance with SP was performed using a self-administered questionnaire. Assessment of environmental cleaning (EC) and reusable medical equipment disinfection has been performed using aseptic swabbing method. The extent of any growth was recorded according to the suggested standards: (A) Presence of indicator organisms, with the proposed standard being <1cfu/cm(2). These include Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Enterococci, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and various multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. (B) Aerobic colony count, the suggested standard is <5cfu/cm(2). The effect of health education intervention on cleaning and disinfection had been analyzed by comparing the difference in cleaning level before and after interventional education. Good knowledge and compliance scores were found in more than 50{\%} of participants. Primary screening found poor EC and equipment disinfection as 67{\%} and 83.3{\%} of stethoscopes and ultrasound transducers, respectively, were contaminated with indicator organisms. For all indicator organisms, a significant reduction was detected after intervention (p=0.00). Prevalence of MRSA was 38.9{\%} and 16.7{\%}, of the total S. aureus isolates, before and after intervention, respectively. Although 27.8{\%} of the total Enterococcus isolates were VRE before intervention, no VRE isolates were detected after intervention. These differences were significant. Development and monitoring of the implementation of infection prevention policies and training of HCP is recommended.}

Here, we demonstrate the involvement of miR-200 b in the metastatic spread of prostate cancer. We identified miR-200 b as a downstream target of androgen receptor and linked its expression to decreased tumorigenicity and metastatic capacity of the prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-200 b in PC-3 cells significantly inhibited their proliferation and the formation of subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, in an orthotopic model, miR-200 b blocked spontaneous metastasis and angiogenesis by PC-3 cells. This decreased metastatic potential was likely due to the reversal of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as was evidenced by increased pan-epithelial marker E-cadherin and specific markers of prostate epithelium, cytokeratins 8 and 18. In contrast, mesenchymal markers, fibronectin and vimentin, were significantly downregulated by miR-200 b. Our results suggest an important role for miR-200 b in prostate cancer progression and indicate its potential utility for prostate cancer therapy.}

Here, we set out to use a comprehensive liquid-biopsy analysis to study cancer and specific TME cells in circulation and their association with disease status. Cytokeratin+, CD45- circulating rare cells (CRCs) from nine breast and four prostate cancer patients were characterized through morphometrics, single-cell copy number analysis, and targeted multiplexed proteomics to delineate cancer cell lineage from other rare cells originating in the TME. We show that we can detect epithelial circulating tumor cells (EPI.CTC), CTCs undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT.CTC) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) using a universal rare event detection platform (HDSCA). Longitudinal analysis of an index patient finds that CTCs are present at the time of disease progression, while CECs are predominately present at the time of stable disease. In a small cohort of prostate and breast cancer patients, we find high inter-patient and temporal intra-patient variability in the expression of tissue specific markers such as ER, HER2, AR, PSA and PSMA and EpCAM. Our study stresses the importance of the multi-omic characterization of circulating rare cells in patients with breast and prostate carcinomas, specifically highlighting overlapping and cell type defining proteo-genomic characteristics of CTCs and CECs.}

 abstract     = {Probably the most vexing question in the 21-year ties between Seoul and Beijing is the increasing gap between the official clarion call for further cooperation and mutual trust-as befits their ``strategic cooperative partnership''(zhanluehezuohuobanquanxi) and the grim reality of diplomatic difficulties and perceptual distance. For sometime, it seems that both sides somehow have taken this irony for granted: an impressive growth in economic and social interactions on the one hand and at the same time the continuing cacophony in a series of concrete and longer-term diplomatic and security issues on the other. In brief, what went wrong? While it is entirely possible that such discrepancy is caused by a multitude of factors, this essay argues that at the very bottom it is a function of cooperating on relatively easier and tangible gains without addressing more complex and longer-terms issue. In other words, their relations are based upon the principle of qiutongcunyi(求同存異), meaning ``seeking commonalities while setting aside the differences.'' In light of the continuing angst and salient issues, on the other hand, it is a must to replace it with yizhongqiutong(異中求 同)-that is, ``seeking commonalities amid acknowledging the differences''-in order to ensure another 20 years of cooperation and friendship down the road.The Major Trends at 21 There is no doubt that since 1992 the ROK and China have remarkably improved their overall bilateral relations. While growing bilateral ties are highly commendable, this does not mean that the two sides are supportive of each other's major policy goals-especially when it comes to concrete issues and longer-term questions on the peninsula. Included in this long list are such important questions as Korean unification, the Koguryo historical case, North Korean residents in China, and the end-state of the North Korean regime. It is in this context that whenever bilateral disputes arise, they tend to spur popular resentment toward the other side, as seen in the death of an ROK maritime policeman in late 2011, the repatriation of North Koreans from China in early 2012, and the stretching of the length of the Great Wall of China into the historically disputed areas in mid-2012.In fact, the 21-year ties between Seoul and Beijing have shown mixed results. At least four distinct patterns stand out: First, there has been a rapid expansion in the scope and the number of actors participating in bilateral ties. Second, there is a serious uneven growth in different issue-areas-as best captured by the term ``hot economy, cold politics.'' Third, the effects of the ``rise of China'' and/or the growing gap in their respective national power are increasingly felt in their bilateral ties. Fourth, there is a collection of gaps in their systems, policies, perceptions, and ideologies.While the ROK is not alone in experiencing China's abstract rhetoric and Aesopian-type condescension, it is worth repeating that their bilateral ties should be based on an objective assessment of major trends and national interests. The above analysis strongly indicates a tacit operational principle by both governments to focus on the ``low-lying fruits,'' while they fail to narrow down the differences in a host of concrete and longer term issues. It is thus necessary to transform the working principle from qiutongcunyitoyizhongqiutong.The Alliance and the North Korean Factor North-South Korean relations as well as the ``North Korean factor'' remain highly sensitive issues not only to South Korean domestic politics but also to its ties with the four major powers. They touch upon a wide range of current and future security issues on the peninsula, ranging from the Six-Party Talks and denuclearization / counter-proliferation efforts to the future of the North Korean regime to peaceful Korean unification.It is thus important to note that the December 19, 2011 announcement of the passing of Kim Jong-il transpired in the post-Cheonan context of tense inter-Korean relations. The repeated revolutionary succession in the Kim family is a major event that has attracted keen attention from the outside. More than a year and a half into Kim Jong-il's death, however, there are no appreciable changes in NorthKorea's external and domestic behavior as if he is still alive.This should not be interpreted as a smooth and stable political succession. It may just mean that the younger Kim has not yet faced the hard test of consolidating his own power base or pursuing his own policies in the face of domestic and external challenges. It may mean ``short-term stability, long-term instability'' in North Korea. How to resolve the chronic economic problems without jeopardizing its survival-which in part depends on the state of the Six-Party Talks-remains a moot question.In the post-Cheonan context as well, Seoul has further strengthened its alliance ties with Washington. A train of such developments as U.S.support for ROK position at the UN Security Council, the 2+2 meetingin Seoul and Washington, and the combined naval exercises indicates the Lee Myung-bak administration's closer ties with the United States and Japan.Additionally, the scheduled transfer of wartime operational control(OPCON) in April 2012 has been adjusted to December 2015, reflecting changes in the ROK's post-Cheonan security environment.Another dimension of the Cheonan crisis is the growin g awareness of the importance of U.S.-China relations in peninsular security. In post-cold war East Asia, China's rise has been a``strategic reality'' to the United States and regional countries in their economic and diplomatic activities. Likewise, China's ascendancy could cause a change in the regional structure of power in which the United States maintains the leading and stabilizing role, a host of bilateral alliance and defense ties, and a set of economic and security objectives.An intriguing question is whether closer ROK-U.S. alliance relations would invite a harsher reaction from China-thus detrimental to the ROK's relations with China-or they would be beneficial for China's overall posture toward it. As long as the Chinese government views the alliance as part of U.S. ``containment'' strategy and its position remains similar to that of North Korea, China is likely to take a critical stance toward the alliance, making peninsular and regional issues more difficult to resolve. The opposite-i.e., the ROK's distraction from the alliance-would be far more consequential for the ROK, however, possibly leading to a more independent yet isolated state without a reliable ally.In a litchi nutshell, it is worthwhile to remember the three most fundamental and longer-term questions in the ROK's diplomatic and security relations with China: a) In light of the U.S. role and influence in regional and peninsular security and of China's growing importance to the ROK, how is it best to cope with the United States and its competition with China? b) How can the ROK reconcile its need for cooperation with China and, at the same time, its potential conflicts with China, as noted above? and c) What role would China actually play in the future of North Korea and the Korean peninsula? Looking Ahead In light of the major trends and the state of affairs in Seoul-Beijing relations, it would be na　ve to believe that there will be an easy and quick fix. Rather, it is prudent to acknowledge the depth of the problems to be addressed. It is thus necessary to take stock of the basic yet unproven assumptions on which we have previously predicated our expectations. It is for this reason that the guiding principle or the working assumption should be based on yizhongqiutong. In other words, It is time to acknowledge the differences on a host of policy issues first before seeking common grounds between the two sides.Besides, both capitals now have new leadership. It is an opportune moment to work on outstanding issues or develop new initiatives. For its part, the Chinese government has defined the first two decades of the 21st century as the ``period of important strategic opportunity'' (zhongyaozhanluejiyuqi) for its national development. The ROK should also be able to seize the ``window of opportunity''when it remains open.At the regional level, finally, the ``rise of China'' and strategic distrust between China and the U.S. are likely to define the security landscape of East Asia. Recent adjustments in U.S. national identity (i.e., ``Pacific Power''), its defense strategy and budget, and regional military presence are issues of immediate concern, but for a longer term concerted efforts for building trust and securing cooperation are now needed than any time before.This would be the most cost-effective investment for continued peace and prosperity for all individual countries and the region as a whole.}

 abstract     = {miR-18a is a member of primary transcript called miR-17-92a (C13orf25 or MIR17HG) which also contains five other miRNAs: miR-17, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b and miR-92a. This cluster as a whole shows specific characteristics, where miR-18a seems to be unique. In contrast to the other members, the expression of miR-18a is additionally controlled and probably functions as its own internal controller of the cluster. miR-18a regulates many genes involved in proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, response to different kinds of stress, autophagy and differentiation. The disturbances of miR-18a expression are observed in cancer as well as in different diseases or pathological states. The miR-17-92a cluster is commonly described as oncogenic and it is known as 'oncomiR-1', but this statement is a simplification because miR-18a can act both as an oncogene and a suppressor. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about miR-18a focusing on its regulation, role in cancer biology and utility as a potential biomarker.}

 abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: In resource-constrained environments, appropriately employing triage in disaster situations is crucial. Although both case-based learning (CBL) and simulation exercises (SEs) commonly are utilized in teaching disaster preparedness to adult learners, there is no substantial evidence supporting one as a more efficacious methodology. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of CBL versus SEs in addition to standard didactic instruction in knowledge attainment pertaining to disaster triage preparedness.METHODS: This RCT was performed during a one-day disaster preparedness course in Lucknow, India during October 2014. Following provision of informed consent, nursing trainees were randomized to knowledge assessment after didactic teaching (control group); didactic plus CBL (Intervention Group 1); or didactic plus SE (Intervention Group 2). The educational curriculum used the topical focus of triage processes during disaster situations. Cases for the educational intervention sessions were scripted, identical between modalities, and employed structured debriefing. Trained live actors were used for SEs. After primary assessment, the groups underwent crossover to take part in the alternative educational modality and were re-assessed. Two standardized multiple-choice question batteries, encompassing key core content, were used for assessments. A sample size of 48 participants was calculated to detect a ≥20{\%} change in mean knowledge score (alpha=0.05; power=80{\%}). Robustness of randomization was evaluated using X 2, anova, and t-tests. Mean knowledge attainment scores were compared using one- and two-sample t-tests for intergroup and intragroup analyses, respectively.RESULTS: Among 60 enrolled participants, 88.3{\%} completed follow-up. No significant differences in participant characteristics existed between randomization arms. Mean baseline knowledge score in the control group was 43.8{\%} (standard deviation=11.0{\%}). Case-based learning training resulted in a significant increase in relative knowledge scores at 20.8{\%} (P=0.003) and 10.3{\%} (P=.033) in intergroup and intragroup analyses, respectively. As compared to control, SEs did not significantly alter knowledge attainment scores with an average score increase of 6.6{\%} (P=.396). In crossover intra-arm analysis, SEs were found to result in a 26.0{\%} decrement in mean assessment score (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Among nursing trainees assessed in this RCT, the CBL modality was superior to SEs in short-term disaster preparedness educational translation. Simulation exercises resulted in no detectable improvement in knowledge attainment in this population, suggesting that CBL may be utilized preferentially for adult learners in similar disaster training settings.

Data were obtained by means of interviews and spirometry.RESULTS: Of the 67 workers, 50 (75.0{\%}) were male; mean age, 46.52 +/- 13.25 years; mean BMI, 25.7 +/- 3.85 kg/m(2); FEV1, 3.24 +/- 0.82 L (93.2 +/- 16.0{\%} of predicted); FVC, 4.02 +/- 0.92 L (95.5 +/- 14.3{\%} of predicted); and FEV1/FVC, 80.31 +/- 9.82. The most common upper airway symptoms were sneezing and nasal secretion-in 24 workers (35.82{\%})-whereas the most common lower airway symptom was cough-in 15 (22.38{\%}).Of the 67 workers, 21 (31.34{\%}) were smokers. In comparison with the nonsmokers, the smokers more often presented with cough (OR = 5.00; p = 0.01), nasal obstruction (OR = 3.50; p = 0.03), nasal itching (OR = 8.80; p = 0.01) and wheezing (OR = 10.0; p = 0.03), as well as presenting with lower FEV1 values (2.93 +/- 0.80 vs. 3.38 +/- 0.80 L; p = 0.04). We detected occupational rhinitis in 14 workers (20.85{\%}), asthma in 4 (5.97{\%}) and COPD in 4 (5.97{\%}).CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory symptoms and airflow reduction were more common in the smoking workers. Controlling the progression of the pyrolysis did not increase the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the charcoal production workers studied.}

 abstract     = {The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation. More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for 'standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group with 'networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare, discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of solidarity in view.}
