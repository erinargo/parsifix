abstract = {The DLR project ALLFlight (Assisted Low-Level Flight and Landing on Unprepared Landing Sites) deals with the development of a helicopter pilot assistance system, to provide pilot assistance during all phases of flight. The research is particularly focused on the landing on unprepared sites in the presence of obstacles and in a degraded visual environment. The goal is to compute a safe flight path in real time that is displayed to the pilot. Several technical components such as a sensor suite to scan the environment, path planning algorithms, head-down and helmet-mounted displays, active inceptors, and the model-based flight control system are set up to form the overall assistance system. Throughout the development, pilot surveys generate requirements to design individual components such as path planning algorithms, or the synthetic view of the helmet-mounted display. Prior surveys accelerate the design and adjustment of the respective components, meaning that the flight tests benefit from well-designed components, minimizing the requirement for further “re-designs”. During ALLFlight, the successfully flight-tested manual landing with path planning and obstacle avoidance in real time for an unknown terrain has been demonstrated. This paper describes each assistance component, the pilot surveys, and the results obtained in almost six years of research.}

However, a large number of issues such as congestion control, safety and security, traffic management exist in modern ITS for which AI-based techniques can be used. From the existing literature, it has been observed that deep learning based techniques are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in ITS which in turns provide unforgettable experience to both the users and drivers. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and their variants are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in modern ITS. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we have reviewed different types of CNN models used in modern ITS for traffic sign recognition, traffic light detection, vehicle classification and pedestrian detection. Various CNN based models and techniques are discussed and compared in comparison to the existing schemes using different performance evaluation metrics. From the in-depth survey provided in this paper, users can identify that which particular model can be used in modern ITS with respect to its merits over the others.}

The NO-FEAR project is built around two interrelated pillars: critical patient care and the safety aspects of healthcare services, especially in a pre-hospital environment. In the context of the emergence of new threats (terrorists, urban violence, climate change, health crises, etc.) security, rescue and health care services must have communication tools adapted to their needs. This article discusses the functionalities of available resources used by first responders that have been tested during many experiments driven by European projects since 2011, such as IFREACT (Improved First Responder Ensembles Against CBRN Terrorism), PRACTICE (Preparedness and Resilience against CBRN Terrorism using Integrated Concepts and Equipment), EDEN (End-user driven DEmo for cbrNe), and more recently the RRF project (Réseau Radio du Futur), which is integrated at the European level with the BroadWay project (future pan-European mobile broadband solutions for public safety).

abstract = {Military Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being increasingly used to provide surveillance and attack capabilities within war zones. At the heart of much of the rhetoric about these aircraft is their supposed ability to enable persistent presence across the battlespace. They are also unique in that they actively distance the aircrew from the aircraft. This paper seeks to question whether this claim to persistent presence can be justified and considers the implications of the distancing of pilot from machine in this. In order to achieve this, the paper focuses upon conceptualising UAVs as assemblages, composed of both human and machine elements. It uses firsthand accounts from a Royal Air Force Reaper UAV aircrew as a basis to analyse the ways in which the deployment of these aircraft in Afghanistan is changing the ways that war is experienced by aerial combatants. It does this through the utilisation of a feminist, embodied geopolitics, refiguring it from a concern with victims of war to argue for its use to understand the micro-scale of how the humans within these UAV assemblages experience combat. This paper thus focuses upon the extent to which the Reaper UAV achieves a persistent presence through analysis of its supposed more-than-human loitering and vision abilities, and the limitations associated with the requirement for a human-in-the loop. The paper contends that although UAVs like the Reaper change the geopolitics of combat, the continuing requirement for the human element of the assemblage restricts their ability to provide persistent presence.}

A database of aviation reports involving laser illumination of flight crewmembers has been established and maintained at the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. A review of recent laser illumination reports was initiated to investigate the significance of these events.
Methods
Reports that involved laser exposures of civilian aircraft in the United States were analyzed for the 13-month period (January 1, 2004, through January 31, 2005).
Results
There were 90 reported instances of laser illumination during the study period. A total of 53 reports involved laser exposure of commercial aircraft. Lasers illuminated the cockpit in 41 (46%) of the incidents. Of those, 13 (32%) incidents resulted in a visual impairment or distraction to a pilot, including 1 incident that reportedly resulted in an ocular injury. Nearly 96% of these reports occurred in the last 3 months of the study period. There were no aviation accidents in which laser light illumination was found to be a contributing factor.
Conclusion
Operational problems have resulted from laser illumination incidents in the national airspace system. Eye care practitioners, to provide effective consultations to their pilot patients, should be familiar with the problems that can occur with laser exposure.}

abstract = {Introduction: One of the primary countermeasures in place to prevent road rule violations is legal enforcement, yet there are numerous applications that can undermine such efforts by notifying drivers of enforcement locations. However, the capabilities of these applications and how they can impact offending behavior is currently unknown. Method: Two studies were conducted to understand which of these applications are being used by drivers and how these applications are impacting road rule violations. Study 1 consisted of a content analysis that involved searching the Google Play Store and Apple iTunes Store for applications that could be used to avoid road rule violations using pre-determined keywords. Meanwhile, Study 2 consisted of 468 licensed Australian drivers (54.5% males) over the age of 17 years (Mage = 35 years) who completed a survey. Results: A total of 73 applications were identified for Study 1, with most of the applications displaying speed camera locations. It was found that applications that notify drivers of traffic enforcement locations are widely prevalent, can be used on a variety of interfaces and include numerous additional features. Study 2 found that those who use the applications were more willing to speed than those who do not use the applications, while there was no difference in phone use while driving between those who do and do not use the applications. Practical Applications: The findings have important implications for stakeholders, policy, and future research. For example, it is suggested that specific functions of these applications need to be regulated to reduce road rule violations and crash risk. Meanwhile, enforcement initiatives need to evolve at a faster rate to keep up to date with the changing technology that can undermine them.}

For better preparation, sharing of resources, engaging the public can make a substantial contribution to these improved community outcomes of disaster resilience through sharing information, identifying problems, and crafting possible solutions collectively. This research develops a framework of a serious game, which is typically used for non-entertainment educational purposes, to harness crowd wisdom and to engage them in facility resilience management. This research first examines traditional methods used in emergency response training, as well as computer simulation-based emergency drills. It next reviews the use of gaming in emergency response training, from board games to computer games utilizing simulation technologies. It is found that alternate reality games, which are driven by transmedia storytelling and intensely devoted to establishing interactions across real and fictional worlds, suit the need of emergency response training best, yet is still lacking. The alternate reality game is designed to provide appropriate challenges that are realistic, and to enhance essential aspects of the player's experience. In the framework, the reality is integrated with virtual game design, and take places offline between play sessions with knowledgeable persons checking the appropriateness of the interface. The alternate reality game is expected to engage facility occupants and to address the need of facility resilience management. Facility management team and emergency management officials are able to gather real-time information about a facility and its occupants. The idea of alternate reality game also has the potential to be applied in other aspects of facility management to achieve a shift from centralized knowledge to a collaborative model that is more adaptive to dynamic situations of a facility.}

This research proposes an information model to facilitate the data flow for post-earthquake assessment of reinforced concrete structures. The schema development was based on typical damage modes and the existing Industry Foundation Class (IFC) schema. Two examples of damaged structures from recent earthquake events, compiled using an experimental damage modeling software, illustrate the use of the data model. The model introduces two new classes, one to represent segments of building elements and the other to model the relationships between segments and cracks. A unique feature is the ability to model the process of damage with a binary tree structure. Methods for exporting as-damaged instance models using IFC are also discussed.}

Fatality rates per vehicle-miles traveled are calculated using data from the Federal Highway Administration. Alcohol-involved drivers who are simultaneously distracted were responsible for 1750 deaths in 2009, an increase of more than 63% from 2005 when there were 1072 deaths. Alcohol use while driving is increasingly responsible for a growing number of fatalities from distracted driving, accounting for 32% of deaths from distracted driving in 2009 versus 24% in 2005. The fatality rate from these crashes increased from 35.9 to 59.2 deaths per 100 billion vehicle-miles traveled after 2005. Alcohol use is quickly increasing as an important factor behind distracted driving fatalities. This has implications for policies combating distracted driving that do not address the role of alcohol use in distracted driving.}

The literature (153 articles) published over the past five years were collected and analyzed systematically, pertaining to the lifecycle model of the product–service system, i.e., design, development, evaluation, and applications. The review indicated that immersive systems and scenarios have been developed and applied in various transportation areas, such as air traffic management, autonomous vehicles, railways, highways, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, the review indicated that immersive technology brings significant benefits to the transportation field and induces significant changes in the interactions between humans and the physical world. These changes are expected to induce digital transformation in several aspects, e.g., digital testbeds for theoretical models and algorithms, immersive and safe digital environments for user studies, and digital training. Based on the review, a novel framework and conceptual lifecycle model of developing immersive technology-enabled digital transformation in transportation is proposed, a novel evaluation matrix for measuring the immersive experience level is established.

Whilst we make several decisions on a daily basis, firefighters in particular are called to make important decisions in a split second and within life-threatening settings. Stress can therefore impact their ability to perform and carry out their job. The implications of stress are similarly important in other settings requiring high-vigilance. In this paper, we aim to contribute to efforts to better train firefighters in decision making in stressful situations through a serious game solution. The game was designed based on the Stress Exposure Training (SET) approach and in accordance with typical stressors identified in the literature. Those were then mapped to relevant game mechanics. The evaluation of the resulting game was twofold: A. to assess its ability to increase participants’ stress level, and B. to investigate whether decision making performance would be improved for participants under stress. The proposed framework and the prototype were evaluated through empirical research that consisted of the participants’ self-reported stress levels using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) and the participants’ physiological measurements, namely galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR). Our results demonstrate the potential of serious games to assist towards training of firefighters to make better decisions under stressful situations. Our findings are of wider importance as they contribute to ongoing efforts to improve decision making under stress in a variety of settings and scenarios.}

However, evolution has led to there being many real animals capable of excellent locomotion. This paper presents a “parasitic robot system” whereby locomotion abilities of an animal are applied to a robot task. We chose a turtle as our first host animal and designed a parasitic robot that can perform “operant conditioning”. The parasitic robot, which is attached to the turtle, can induce object-tracking behavior of the turtle toward a Light Emitting Diode (LED) and positively reinforce the behavior through repeated stimulus-response interaction. After training sessions over five weeks, the robot could successfully control the direction of movement of the trained turtles in the waypoint navigation task. This hybrid animal-robot interaction system could provide an alternative solution to some of the limitations of conventional mobile robot systems in various fields, and could also act as a useful interaction system for the behavioral sciences.}

abstract = {Poor visibility can pose a serious safety hazard in helicopter flight, leading to a loss of situation awareness, spatial disorientation, and high pilot workload. Therefore, the use of helmet-mounted displays recently became increasingly important for rotary-wing aircraft. To assist pilots in degraded visual environment, new HMD symbology designs were developed at the DLR Institute of Flight Guidance. They were tested in a simulator study with 18 civil and military helicopter pilots and compared to a state-of-the art PFD/ND test condition. Concurrent task performance was investigated, which included the detection and identification of targets in the environment. Hit rate was analyzed as a function of display type, visibility, target type, and the presence or absence of cueing. Moreover, differences between pilot experience and operational area were assessed. Results revealed a significant HMD detection cost for un-cued targets compared to when no symbology was presented. In contrast, cueing significantly increased hit rate, resulting in substantial HMD benefits when proper attentional guidance was provided.}

abstract = {Security operations centers (SOCs) are the 911 centers of many organizational networks, except they not only respond, but also monitor. SOC operators are charged with detection, response, and mitigation. This is a tall task when one considers the volume, velocity, and variety of both internal and external organizational network and system data. SOC operations are truly a big data problem. Security orchestration, incident event management, data fusion, and anomaly detection systems help, but more is needed. This study examines the impact virtual reality (VR) can have on SOC operator performance and perceived task load. We developed a VR based network monitoring tool and assigned human subjects to one of three conditions – VR only, traditional tool only, or both. Our results, though small in scale, provide very promising indication that VR based technology may be beneficial for improving cyber situational awareness (SA), particularly with overall data perception involving novice SOC operators. The results are promising, but the sample size is small, so future research should validate this pilot study. Given the workforce challenges in the cybersecurity space, and the need to perceive large quantities of data, VR may be a very good addition to SOCs.}

abstract = {Applications that cater to the needs of disaster incident response generate large amount of data and demand large computational resource access. Such datasets are usually collected in real-time at the incident scenes using different Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hierarchical clouds, i.e., core and edge clouds, can help these applications’ real-time data orchestration challenges as well as with their IoT operations scalability, reliability and stability by overcoming infrastructure limitations at the ad-hoc wireless network edge. Routing is a crucial infrastructure management orchestration mechanism for such systems. Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose. In this paper, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI)-augmented geographic routing approach, that relies on an area knowledge obtained from the satellite imagery (available at the edge cloud) by applying deep learning. In particular, we propose a stateless greedy forwarding that uses such an environment learning to proactively avoid the local minimum problem by diverting traffic with an algorithm that emulates electrostatic repulsive forces. In our theoretical analysis, we show that our Greedy Forwarding achieves in the worst case a 3.291 path stretch approximation bound with respect to the shortest path, without assuming presence of symmetrical links or unit disk graphs. We evaluate our approach with both numerical and event-driven simulations, and we establish the practicality of our approach in a real incident-supporting hierarchical cloud deployment to demonstrate improvement of application level throughput due to a reduced path stretch under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios.}

At the time of writing, DJI was the drone manufacturer with the largest market share. Our work presents the primary thorough forensic analysis of the DJI Phantom III drone, and the primary account for proprietary file structures stored by the examined drone. It also presents the forensically sound open source tool DRone Open source Parser (DROP) that parses proprietary DAT files extracted from the drone's nonvolatile internal storage. These DAT files are encrypted and encoded. The work also shares preliminary findings on TXT files, which are also proprietary, encrypted, encoded, files found on the mobile device controlling the drone. These files provided a slew of data such as GPS locations, battery, flight time, etc. By extracting data from the controlling mobile device, and the drone, we were able to correlate data and link the user to a specific device based on extracted metadata. Furthermore, results showed that the best mechanism to forensically acquire data from the tested drone is to manually extract the SD card by disassembling the drone. Our findings illustrated that the drone should not be turned on as turning it on changes data on the drone by creating a new DAT file, but may also delete stored data if the drone's internal storage is full.}

To investigate the factors affecting behavior of mobile phone use while driving, 1106 respondents from four different regions in Thailand participated in the questionnaire survey study. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to explain these factors including two additional extended factors which are risk perception and law enforcement knowledge. The outcome of this part shows that attitude, norm, and law enforcement knowledge significantly affect the intention and behavior of the drivers. Even though approximately 90 percent of drivers realized that using a mobile phone while driving was dangerous and against the law, they have reported that they still use mobile phone while driving. To determine the effect of mobile phone use on driving performance, a 2-lane, straight rural highway, with a leading vehicle and an unexpected “STOP” sign, were simulated in order to examine the driving performance of drivers “without a phone”, “talking on a phone call”, and “texting a message” conditions. The results found that using mobile phone while driving can reduce speed and following distance, but increase lateral deviation, steer deviation, steer speed, perception-reaction time, and number of near misses leading to higher risks for road crashes.}

The study used a survey and a semi-structured script that explored five main topics: difficulties of using radiation detection with respect to the equipment and environment; preferences for handle design; preferences for control design; preferences for screen, menu, and interface design, and instructional and maintenance issues. The focus group indicated a desire for fewer and bigger buttons to control the device, a desire for a san serif font type for the display, a request to minimize the use of abbreviations and symbols in the text display, having a color coding display bar to describe radiation levels, and a need for detailed maintenance procedures and processes. These results provide important feedback for planning the development and testing of a more ergonomic radiation detector.
Relevance to industry
A hand-held radiation detector to test for fissionable materials is one of the essential tools used by first responders. This paper presents the results from a focus group of first responders exploring characteristics for a more ergonomic detector.}

On-bike human–machine interfaces (HMIs) and connecting cyclists to AVs and the road infrastructure may have the potential to enhance the safety of cyclists. This study aimed to identify cyclists’ needs in today’s and future traffic, and explore on-bike HMI functionality and the implications of equipping cyclists with devices to communicate with AVs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 cyclists in Norway and 15 cyclists in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors of cyclist-AV interaction and on-bike HMIs. From the analysis, seven themes were identified: Interaction, Bicycles, Culture, Infrastructure, Legislation, AVs, and HMI. These themes are diverse and overlap with factors grouped in sub-themes. The results indicated that the cyclists prefer segregated future infrastructure, and in mixed urban traffic, they need confirmation of detection by AVs. External on-vehicle or on-bike HMIs might be solutions to fulfil the cyclists’ need for recognition. However, the analysis suggested that cyclists are hesitant about being equipped with devices to communicate with AVs: Responsibility for safety should lie with AV technology rather than with cyclists. A device requirement might become a barrier to cycling, as bicycles are traditionally cheap and simple, and additional costs might deter people from choosing cycling as a transport mode. Future studies should investigate user acceptance of on-bike HMIs among cyclists on a larger scale to test the findings’ generalisability, and explore other, perhaps more viable solutions than on-bike HMIs for enhancing AV-cyclist interaction.}

The widespread reliance on motor vehicles has negative effects on both the environment and human health. The development of an innovative in-vehicle human-machine interface (HMI) has the potential to contribute to reducing traffic pollution and road trauma.
Aim
A qualitative study, using a driver-centred design approach, was carried out to test how best to provide ecological and safe (eco-safe) driving advice and feedback to drivers on their driving style via an in-vehicle HMI.
Method
A total of 34 drivers (52.9% males), aged 19–61years, participated in focus groups which explored concepts from the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989).
Findings
Main themes emerging from the focus groups were: (i) perceived importance of eco-safe driving behaviour; (ii) perceived usefulness of eco-safe in-vehicle HMIs; (iii) intentions to use an eco-safe in-vehicle HMI; (iv) perceptions toward eco-safe in-vehicle HMI design characteristics; and (v) potential problems associated with using eco-safe in-vehicle HMIs.
Implications
This study provides the foundation to inform the design and development of an evidence-based in-vehicle eco-safe HMI with high levels of driver acceptance. Recommendations for future research are also discussed.}

Many of these situations can be safely simulated for training purposes in the real world. Radiological threats, however, are difficult to simulate due to the lack of materials that can mimic radiation sources without the danger of the real radiation. To address the need for a system to train CSTs to respond to radiological threats, we have developed the Radiological Immersive Survey Training (RIST) system. RIST simulates radiological threats from multiple sources using a realistic real-time shielding model based on ray casting and allows users to practice surveying the threat using simulated representations of the world and equipment. We have developed an after action review tool to allow a trainer to show trainees a recording of their survey and how they can improve. We also created a scenario design tool to allow the trainer to create complex environments with radiological threats. We developed novel multi-user interaction techniques to enable simultaneous training for two CST members in an immersive virtual environment. We also introduced a novel multi-perspective rendering technique for two users based on each user's task rather than field of view. Finally, we conducted a preliminary user study with several pairs of expert users to measure user preferences and the effects of using this technique, in conjunction with how altering which user navigated, on user performance. CST survey teams from two states have now used the system for training.}

The lack of predictive safety systems that notify workers of upcoming dangers in advance is a major reason to blame in the highway maintenance and operation community. This article presents an integrative design framework for bringing recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the safety of highway workers through real-time multimodal notifications on-spot. To this end, this article conceptualizes and co-designs three major pillars: (1) AR user interface design for multimodal notification, (2) real-time AI at the edge for vehicle detection/classification from distance, and (3) real-time wireless communication in work zone setting to enable latency-aware operation between AI and AR components. Our early results demonstrate that we can achieve 24.83 FPS end-to-end execution latency on the Xavier AGX Jetson board with 48.7% mAP on BDD100K dataset, and a real-time communication covering 120 meters with an average latency of 5.1 ms at the farthest distance. Our mixed-method user research also reveals an acceptable level of excitement and engagement from the body of highway workers toward both the proposed technology and the designed user interface. Overall, this article provides a proof-of-concept toward AI-enabled AR safety systems in highway work zones.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) regularly hits the headlines and frankly it is exciting to imagine a world where we can control literally everything from a smartphone. Or is it? It is all too easy to get swept along with the relentless advances in connected devices that we are experiencing, but perhaps there is also a contrarian viewpoint that we need to consider. As companies such as Google, Apple and BMW forge ahead with driverless cars and applying the Internet of things (IoT) in transport, it's easy to get carried away by the relentless advances in connected devices. But how will all these innovations be kept secure and how can we be sure users will be safe when our transport could be accessed via the Internet? Richard Kirk of AlienVault, discusses the future risks of IoT in transport, how technological advances have made this possible, and how a lack of a security-oriented mindset is threatening the industry.}

abstract = {Any specific technology derives attributes from the generic technologies of which it is an instance. A drone is a flying computer. It is dependent on local data communications from its onboard sensors and to its onboard effectors, and on telecommunications links over which it receives data-feeds and command-feeds from terrestrial and perhaps airborne sources and from satellites. A drone acts on the world, and is therefore a robot. The remote pilots, and the operators of drone facilities such as cameras, depend on high-tech tools that interpret data that display transmitted, enhanced and generated image and video, and that enable the composition of commands. So drone operators are already cyborgs. Many drones carry cameras and are used for surveillance. Computing, data communications, robotics, cyborgisation and surveillance offer power and possibilities, but with them come disbenefits and risks. Critical literatures exist in relation to all of those areas. An inspection of those literatures should provide insights into the limitations of drones, and the impacts and implications arising from their use.}

During this phase, system designers need to accurately elicit, model and validate the desired system based on user requirements. Smart driver assistive technologies (SDAT) belong to a class of complex systems that are used to alleviate accident risk by improving situation awareness, reducing driver workload or enhancing driver attentiveness. Such systems aim to draw drivers’ attention on critical information cues that improve decision making. Discovering the requirements for such systems necessitates a holistic approach that addresses not only functional and non-functional aspects but also the human requirements such as drivers’ situation awareness and workload. This work describes a simulation-based user requirements discovery method. It utilizes the benefits of a modular virtual reality simulator to model driving conditions to discover user needs that subsequently inform the design of prototype SDATs that exploit the augmented reality method. Herein, we illustrate the development of the simulator, the elicitation of user needs through an experiment and the prototype SDAT designs using UNITY game engine.}

Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept. Guidelines for MCT design were validated with an online survey completed by 81 police officers. Future research directions were proposed to recognize police officer needs and work context.}

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

By 2030, a 50% rise in lighting demand of the existing consumption is projected due to an increase in the global population. To address the concern of rising lighting electricity consumption, the key strategy is to develop and provide energy efficient lighting products to consumers. In this respect, the Solid-State Lighting (SSL) has the potential to offer power efficiencies that are superior to those of conventional lighting sources. Recently, white organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have emerged as the leading technology for the new display and lighting market which has attracted substantial attention of manufacturers, product designers, and end users. OLED devices have already entered into high end lighting markets such as designer, automotive, aerospace, high-end architectural lighting, and other applications. Moreover, innovative flexible OLED devices are thought to be candidates for the next-generation SSL systems, wearable electronics, mobile devices, microdisplays, etc. as they are lighter, thinner and more durable compared to glass (rigid) based devices. In the present review, distinctive features of OLEDs SSL lighting, technical requirements of lighting for applications, OLED basic, and classification of OLED devices, including quantum dot (QD) OLEDs (QLED) as well as the need of development of OLEDs standards are discussed. Various constituents of flexible OLED lighting, OLED lighting panels by some manufacturers, hurdles in OLED lighting technologies, performance of OLEDs in harsh conditions, challenges in flexible OLEDs, OLED lighting technology comparison, OLED lighting roadmap, and future directions including cost reduction analysis, flexible OLED incorporated into automotive, IoT (Internet of Things) connected lighting system, OLED market projections, etc. are also presented. It is suggested that the white OLEDs, and flexible OLEDs in particular, lighting products have potential to revolutionize the future of lighting systems, industries, and the market.}

In recent times aviation, communication, medicine, and information dissemination have had major impetus from military research and development funding agencies. Widespread nonmilitary use of a technology can also lower costs sufficiently to make its large-scale integration into military systems feasible. For several decades, the military has employed thermoelectrics (TE) modules in a number of niche applications, and that continues to be the case. However, the number and importance of the niches is growing with the increasing technological sophistication of war fighting, and this is bound to continue. The United States Marines and Army Rangers go into combat carrying more weight in batteries than in munitions. The chapter discusses that sensors are needed for the remarkably small-caliber “smart” munitions that forward-looking research now envisions. It seems inevitable that more energy harvesting and sensor cooling is needed. The TE knowledge base and cadre of experts developed in the scientific community by the recent surge in military-funded TE research should prove to be a national asset in meeting these needs.}

Despite this, only relatively little is currently known about the types of errors that drivers make and of the causal factors that contribute to these errors being made. This article presents an overview of the literature on human error in road transport. In particular, the work of three pioneers of human error research, Norman, Reason and Rasmussen, is scrutinised. An overview of the research on driver error follows, to consider the different types of errors that drivers make. It was found that all but one of these does not use a human error taxonomy. A generic driver error taxonomy is therefore proposed based upon the dominant psychological mechanisms thought to be involved. These mechanisms are: perception, attention, situation assessment, planning, and intention, memory and recall, and action execution. In addition, a taxonomy of road transport error causing factors, derived from the review of the driver error literature, is also presented. In conclusion to this article, a range of potential technological solutions that could be used to either prevent, or mitigate, the consequences of the driver errors identified are specified.}

abstract = {Purpose
Fitness level modulates the physiological responses to exercise for a variety of indices. While intense bouts of exercise have been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity (Tosm), it is not known if fitness level can affect the Tosm response to acute exercise. This study aims to compare the effect of a maximal incremental test on Tosm between trained and untrained military helicopter pilots.
Methods
Nineteen military helicopter pilots (ten trained and nine untrained) performed a maximal incremental test on a treadmill. A tear sample was collected before and after physical effort to determine the exercise-induced changes on Tosm.
Results
The Bayesian statistical analysis demonstrated that Tosm significantly increased from 303.72 ± 6.76 to 310.56 ± 8.80 mmol/L after performance of a maximal incremental test. However, while the untrained group showed an acute Tosm rise (12.33 mmol/L of increment), the trained group experienced a stable Tosm physical effort (1.45 mmol/L). There was a significant positive linear association between fat indices and Tosm changes (correlation coefficients [r] range: 0.77–0.89), whereas the Tosm changes displayed a negative relationship with the cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2 max; r = −0.75) and performance parameters (r = −0.75 for velocity, and r = −0.67 for time to exhaustion).
Conclusions
The findings from this study provide evidence that fitness level is a major determinant of Tosm response to maximal incremental physical effort, showing a fairly linear association with several indices related to fitness level. High fitness level seems to be beneficial to avoid Tosm changes as consequence of intense exercise.}

Efforts for developing sense through the wall (STTW) systems, such as those undertaken by the US Army Technology Objective (ATO) program, aim at providing the soldier with situational awareness information before breaching a building in a military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) environment. STTW capabilities also support law enforcement and search and rescue applications. Since 2002, extensive evaluations of STTW technologies, most notably those performed by the Communications Electronics, Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), have been made to determine which technology could be the most viable solution. After conducting comprehensive studies, I2WD initiated several Phase I efforts and Phase II efforts. The purpose behind both efforts was to develop various STTW technology demonstrators under a 5 year ATO. Many lessons learned during the development of Phase I systems were incorporated into the considerations for Phase II developments. This paper discusses design challenges and issues with sensing through walls at different standoff distances and wall types through lessons learned and results from modeling and simulations performed by the Army Research Laboratory.}

Method: Previous analyses of the relationships between functional capacity measures and at-fault crash involvement for older drivers as reported in the NHTSA Model Driver Screening and Evaluation Program Final Technical Report have been updated to include one additional year of driving experience. Eighteen new at-fault crashes involving drivers who previously had no crash involvement were recorded for the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) test sample during this interval. The method of odds ratio (OR) calculation was used to examine the relationships between functional status predictors and the most salient among the safety outcome measures identified in the Maryland research. Peak valid OR values for the prior and current analyses were contrasted, and the stability of candidate pass–fail cut-points for each predictor relative to values identified in the Final Technical Report was examined. Results: Results indicate that the predictive value of functional tests appears to decrease over time, particularly for the perceptual–cognitive measures. Impact on Industry: The impact of these findings on programs and policies is to underscore a need for periodic reevaluation, spaced at the shortest practical intervals but not more than 2 years apart, in order for functional capacity screening to be applied effectively by licensing authorities, health care professionals, and others to reduce personal risk and enhance public safety.}

abstract = {To better understand the research focus and development direction in the field of driving behavior active intervention, thereby laying a scientific foundation for further research, we used the combination of topic words and keywords to retrieve relevant articles from the Core Collection Database of Web of Science (WOS). A total of 578 articles published from 1992 to 2022 were finally obtained. Firstly, the time distribution characteristics, country distribution, institution distribution and main source journal distribution of published articles were explored. Then, by using the CiteSpace and VOSviewer software, cited reference co-citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis and burst detection analysis were carried out respectively to visually explore the knowledge base, research topic, research frontier and development trend of this field. The results indicate that the USA, Australia and China are the three most active countries in the studies of driving behavior active intervention. Accidental Analysis & Prevention, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behavior, and Journal of Safety Research are widely selected journals for publications related to this field. The research frontiers in the field of driving behavior active intervention focus on: “traffic safety and crashes analysis, as well as enforcement intervention”, “driving risk and education for young drivers”, “information provision and driving behavior”, “workload and situation awareness for automated driving”. It is worth noting that in recent years, “warning system”, “time”, “work load” have become research hotspots in this field. To sum up, by a bibliometric overview of research on driving behavior active intervention over the past thirty years, this paper clarifies the development skeleton of this research field, determines its hot topics and research progress, and provides a reference for the follow-up exploratory scientific research in this field.}

abstract = {Objective
We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance.
Background
Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity.
Method
Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone.
Results
In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate.
Conclusion
Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance.
Application
The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance.
Précis
High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

abstract = {Fixed and rotary wing pilots alike are familiar with potential instabilities or with annoying limit cycle oscillations that arise from the effort of controlling aircraft with high response actuation systems. Understanding, predicting and suppressing these inadvertent and sustained aircraft oscillations, known as aircraft (rotorcraft)-pilot couplings (A/RPCs) is a challenging problem for the designers. The goal of the present paper is to give an overview on the state-of-the-art in RPC problem, underlining the future challenges in this field. It is shown that, exactly as in the case of fixed wing APCs, RPCs existed from the beginning of rotorcraft development and that the problem of eliminating them is not yet solved: the current rotorcraft modelling for RPC analysis is rather limited to the particular case analysed and there is a lack of quantitative pilot behavioural models to analyse RPCs. The paper underlines the importance of involuntary pilot control actions, generally attributed to biodynamic couplings in predicting RPCs in rotorcraft. It is also shown that recent experiences demonstrate that modern rotorcraft seem to embed tendencies predisposing the flight control system FCS system towards dangerous RPCs. As the level of automation is likely to increase in future designs, extending to smaller aircraft and to different kinds of operation, the consequences of the pilot ‘fighting’ the FCS system and inducing A/RPCs needs to be eradicated. In Europe, the ARISTOTEL project (2010–2013) has been launched with the aim of understanding and predicting modern aircraft's susceptibility to A/RPC. The present paper gives an overview of future challenges to be solved for RPC-free design and some new solutions herein.}

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) has been used successfully in several industries; one of these is education. A systematic understanding of how AR contributes to education still lacks studies about the content type and its effects on learning outcomes. This article systematically analyzes the AR state-of-the-art in education, determines productivity and publication indicators in this field, and identifies research works that have studied how content type affects the learning outcomes. The methodology was performed through a bibliometric analysis using the Scopus database, focusing on AR's educational uses. Engineering education is the primary research trend, followed by simulation, tracking, and virtual reality. Education and e-learning also have leading roles within this analysis, along with gamification and human-computer interaction, whose impacts are further explored. There is no preferred design methodology for creating AR content. In its absence, most of the works suggest a design based on the developers' and researchers' experience.}
