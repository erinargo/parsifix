abstract = {This paper presents methods for a cooperative rescue operation in partially or totally unknown areas with human and robotic explorers. Cooperation is based on a common presence i.e. a common understanding of the environment for both humans and robots. The common presence is generated by continuous mapping data supplied by robotic and human entities. Mapping data is pre-processed and transmitted to the mission controller/operator, who finally filters the data to a common presence, which is transmitted continuously back to both entities. The studied methods are human navigation without artificial beacons, human and robotic SLAM, cooperative localization and cooperative map/model building for common presence. Methods are developed, tested and integrated in a European Community research project called Pe LoTe.}

However, the widespread use of such systems will be limited unless a few key hurdles are overcome, namely improved usability and support for safe operation in dynamic environments. To this end, we present the Collision and Obstacle Detection and Alerting (CODA) display, a novel interface that enables safe piloting of MAVs with a mobile device in obstacle-dense real-world settings. We describe the system design, architecture, and development. In addition, we present observations from a proof-of-concept technical demonstration and an empirical study with minimally-trained users. Results showed that CODA reduced collisions and improved operator awareness of obstacle proximity, confidence going around corners and perceived performance in avoiding walls and obstacles.}

abstract = {Context:
The demand for protection and security of physical spaces and urban areas increased with the escalation of terroristic attacks in recent years. We envision with the proposed cyber–physical systems and spaces, a city that would indeed become a smarter urbanistic object, proactively providing alerts and being protective against any threat.
Objectives:
This survey intend to provide a systematic multivocal literature survey comprised of an updated, comprehensive and timely overview of state of the art in counter-terrorism cyber–physical systems, hence aimed at the protection of cyber–physical spaces. Hence, provide guidelines to law enforcement agencies and practitioners providing a description of technologies and best practices for the protection of public spaces.
Methods:
We analyzed 112 papers collected from different online sources, both from the academic field and from websites and blogs ranging from 2004 till mid-2022.
Results:
(a) There is no one single bullet-proof solution available for the protection of public spaces. (b) From our analysis we found three major active fields for the protection of public spaces: Information Technologies, Architectural approaches, Organizational field. (c) While the academic suggest best practices and methodologies for the protection of urban areas, the market did not provide any type of implementation of such suggested approaches, which shows a lack of fertilization between academia and industry.
Conclusion:
The overall analysis has led us to state that there is no one single solution available, conversely, multiple methods and techniques can be put in place to guarantee safety and security in public spaces. The techniques range from architectural design to rethink the design of public spaces keeping security into account in continuity, to emerging technologies such as AI and predictive surveillance.}

More data can be gathered from the crisis site, arriving in a large flow of various types from multiple sources such as sensors, open data, or social media. This huge amount of data coming continuously from the crisis site leads to an ever-changing situational awareness that must be built and understood as quickly as it is evolving to ensure a relevant and effective crisis response. To build a shared situational awareness, decision-makers can gather in a room where they can share and compare the information they receive from the crisis site to build a common operational picture that they can use to make decisions and implement them: this is a crisis management cell. However, the tools in traditional crisis management cells may not be able to keep up with the new requirements induced by these changes: we need modular and dynamic tools able to adapt to the crisis and the needs of the crisis managers while ensuring collaboration and information sharing not only between the stakeholders but also with remote experts that might be needed to understand the situation. We need to start conceiving the future crisis management cell that would meet the new exigencies of crisis management. This paper proposes our version of that future crisis management cell, using virtual reality to provide a dynamic and modular crisis management cell linked to artificial intelligence and decision-support systems.}

abstract = {Aim
To analyze the effectiveness of a teaching-learning methodology for teletraining in basic life support (BLS) based on communication through smart glasses.
Design
Pilot quasi-experimental non-inferiority study.
Participants
Sixty college students.
Interventions
Randomization of the participants in: tele-training through smart glasses (SG) and traditional training (C) groups. Both training sessions were very brief (less than 8 min) and included the same BLS content. In SG, the instructor trained through a video call with smart glasses.
Main variables of interest
The BLS protocol, the use of AED, the quality of resuscitation and the response times were evaluated.
Results
In most of the BLS protocol variables, the resuscitation quality and performance times, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. There were significant differences (in favor of the SG) in the assessment of breathing (SG: 100%, C: 81%; p = 0.013), the not-to-touch warning before applying the shock (SG: 79%, C: 52%; p = 0.025) and compressions with correct recoil (SG: 85%, C: 32%; p = 0.008).
Conclusions
Laypeople BLS-AED brief tele-training through smart glasses could potentially be, at least, as effective as traditional training methods. In addition, smart glasses could be more advantageous than traditional teaching for certain points of the BLS protocol and chest compressions quality, probably due to the capability of real-time visualization of images which supports the BLS sequence. Augmented reality supported teaching should be considered for BLS training, although caution is required in extrapolating findings, and further in-depth studies are needed to confirm its potential role depending on concrete target populations and environments.
Resumen
Objetivo
Analizar la efectividad de una metodología de enseñanza-aprendizaje de teleformación en soporte vital básico (SVB) basada en la comunicación a través de smart glasses.
Diseño
Estudio piloto cuasi experimental de no inferioridad.
Participantes
Sesenta estudiantes universitarios.
Intervenciones
Aleatorización de los participantes en: grupo de teleformación a través de smart glasses (SG) y formación tradicional (C). Ambas sesiones de entrenamiento fueron muy breves (<8 minutos) e incluyeron el mismo contenido en de SVB. En SG, el entrenamiento fue comunicándose a través de una videollamada con smart glasses.
Variables de interés principales
Se evaluó el protocolo del SVB, el uso de DEA, la calidad de la reanimación y los tiempos de actuación.
Resultados
En la mayoría de las variables del protocolo del SVB, la calidad de la reanimación y los tiempos de ejecución, no hubo diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre grupos. Hubo mejor actuación de SG al valorar la respiración (SG: 100%, C: 81%; p = 0,013), el avisar antes de la descarga del DEA (SG: 79%, C: 52%; p = 0,025) y las compresiones con buena reexpansión (SG: 85%, C: 32%; p = 0,008).
Conclusiones
El tele-entrenamiento en SVB-DEA para legos con smart glasses podría llegar a ser, al menos, tan efectivo como un método tradicional de enseñanza. Además, las smart glasses podrían ser más ventajosas para ciertos aspectos del protocolo del SVB y la calidad de las compresiones, probablemente debido a la capacidad de visualización de imágenes en tiempo real. La enseñanza basada en la realidad aumentada debe considerarse para la capacitación en SVB, aunque se requiere tanto cautela en la extrapolación de hallazgos como estudios futuros con mayor profundidad.}

Many services provided by IoT devices (e.g., augmented reality, location-tracking, traffic systems, and autonomous driving) require intensive real-time data processing, which demands powerful computational resources. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced to effectively handle this problem reliably over the internet. The inclusion of a MEC server allows computationally intensive tasks to be offloaded from IoT devices. However, communication overhead and delays are major drawbacks. With the advantages of high mobility and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can mitigate this issue by acting as MEC servers. The offloading decisions for such scenarios involve service latency, energy/power consumption, and execution delays. For this reason, this study reviews UAV-enabled MEC solutions in which offloading was the focus of research. We compare the algorithms qualitatively to assess features and performance. Finally, we discuss open issues and research challenges in terms of design and implementation.}

Laypeople should be trained in basic life support and traditional and innovative methodologies may help to obtain this goal. However, there is a knowledge gap about the ideal basic life support training methods. Smart glasses could have a role facilitating laypeople learning of basic life support.
Aim
To analyze the potential impact on basic life support learning of a very brief training supported by smart glasses video communication.
Methods
Twelve laypeople were basic life support tele-trained by means of smart glasses by an instructor in this pilot study. During training (assisted trough smart glasses) and after the training (unassisted) participants’ performance and quality of basic life support and automated external defibrillation procedure were assessed on a standardized simulated scenario.
Results
After the training all participants were able to deliver good quality basic life support, with results comparable to those obtained when real time remotely guided by the instructor through the smart glasses. Mean chest compression rate was significantly higher when not guided (113 /min vs. 103 /min, p = 0.001). When not assisted, the participants spent less time delivering the sequential basic life support steps than when assisted while training.
Conclusions
A very brief remote training supported by instructor and smart glasses seems to be an effective educational method that could facilitate basic life support learning by laypeople. This technology could be considered in cases where instructors are not locally available or in general in remote areas, providing basic internet connection is available. Smart glasses could also be useful for laypeople rolling-refreshers.}

It is a remote, non-line-of-sight sensor to detect threats more reliably and provide increased security protection, which is of utmost importance to military and law enforcement applications. However, the use of the LDV in situation surveillance, especially in vehicle classification, lacks systematic investigations as to its phenomenological and statistical properties. In this work, we aim to identify vehicles by their engine types within a very short period of time to yield a practical expert and intelligent system to classify vehicle engines remotely using laser sensors. Based on our preliminary success on the use of tone-pitch indexes (TPI) over these data, a new normalized tone-pitch indexing (nTPI) scheme is developed to capture engine periodic vibrations by various engine types with vibration data over a much shorter period (from 1.25 to 0.2 s), which makes it possible to monitor slowly moving vehicles around 15 miles per hour. We also exploit the learning power of neural computing, including artificial neural network (ANN), Deep Belief nets (DBN), Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To apply a CNN, a two-dimensional array is formulated by stacking nTPI data in an overlapping manner, which is termed as 2DonTPI. The classification results using the proposed nTPI and 2DonTPI over a standard LDV dataset are promising: with encoding duration significantly smaller than that required by the original TPI, consistently high performance is attained for all four neural computing methods. The new vibration data representation combined with neural computing approaches gives rise to a powerful expert and intelligent system for vehicle engine classification, which can find a great array of applications for civil, law enforcement, and military agencies for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance purposes that are of crucial importance to national and international security.}

A review of the application of ImTs for OSH training and education is conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach and bibliometric analysis. This resulted in the evaluation of 67 relevant journal articles collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The review revealed that ImTs have been applied for OSH training and education in various industries including transportation, construction, mining, and healthcare. It was also revealed that the OSH hazards addressed by ImT-based training and education include but are not limited to fire, fall, electrical and chemical hazards in order to prevent or reduce injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition, it was revealed that one of the benefits of ImTs for OSH training and education is better retention of concepts when compared to conventional training and education. Challenges associated with the use of ImTs for OSH training and education include insufficient display brightness for users to effectively see virtual objects in a brightly luminated environment. Among the recommendations for future work is research into how to develop effective communication methods between trainers and trainees immersed in a virtual environment for trainers to fully understand the difficulties trainees experience in operating the developed ImT-based platform and provide solutions to such difficulties.}

Due to the rapid development of display hardware and tracking systems, virtual and augmented reality applications are being developed today that would only have been possible in large research laboratories with huge efforts a few years ago. This paper presents the application of the augmented reality technology (AR) in the industrial field. Based on industrial case studies the implementation of two AR applications and their potential to digitize the product lifecycle processes will be discussed. The use cases were developed within cooperation projects between the University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe and a fire truck manufacturer. The case studies focus on the following topics: digital product configuration management and production planning and assistance. The objective of the case studies is the investigation of the AR application in the industrial environment and its capability as digital transformation technology along the product lifecycle. The presented case studies deliver experiences and suggestions in terms of praxis-oriented development and deployment of the AR technology in the engineering field, which can be used for future AR research works.}

abstract = {Background
A robust estimation method is needed to prevent medication dosing and equipment sizing errors and improve time to administration during paediatric resuscitation. An electronic measurement with computer interface may improve accuracy and alleviate cognitive burden. This study evaluates the accuracy of two electronic height measurement methods, a laser and an optical device, and compares them to the Broselow™ Pediatric Emergency Tape (BT) for weight estimation.
Methods
We enrolled children ages 0–14 years from the emergency department of a free-standing, academic children’s hospital. We obtained sex, body habitus, true weight, true height, BT colour, and experimental heights. We converted experimental height measurements into weight estimates using standardised growth charts. We calculated Pearson correlations between experimental and actual measurements and the percentages of weight estimates within 10% and 20% of true weights. We repeated analyses on a restricted cohort of children 0–11 years, the intended BT age range.
Results
We enrolled 198 children. The laser, optical device and BT weight estimates had strong positive correlations with the actual weight measurements with Pearson’s correlation coefficients of 0.946, p < 0.0001, 0.965, p < 0.0001, and 0.825, p < 0.0001 respectively. 47.8% of optical weight estimates fell within 10% of actual weight and 80.6% within 20%, compared to 40.5% and 75.4% of laser estimates and 39.8% and 65.1% of BT estimates.
Conclusion
Electronic-based weight estimates were more accurate than the BT. The accuracy of medication dosing and equipment sizing during paediatric resuscitation may be improved by integrating optical height-based weight estimates with electronic clinical decision support.}

Thus, wireless traffic grows in volume and complexity, making prediction, investment planning, and regulation increasingly difficult. This article characterizes urban wireless traffic evolution, supporting operators to drive mobile network evolution and policymakers to increase national and local competitiveness. We propose a holistic method that widens previous research scope, including new devices and the effect of policy from multiple government levels. We provide an analytical formulation that combines existing complementary methods on traffic evolution research and diverse data sources. Results for a centric area of Helsinki during 2020–2030 indicate that daily volumes increase, albeit a surprisingly large part of the traffic continues to be generated by smartphones. Machine traffic gains importance, driven by surveillance video cameras and connected cars. While camera traffic is sensitive to law enforcement policies and data regulation, car traffic is less affected by transport electrification policy. High-priority traffic remains small, even under encouraging autonomous vehicle policies. Based on peak hour results, we suggest that 5G small cells might be needed around 2025, albeit the utilization of novel radio technology and additional mid-band spectrum could delay this need until 2029. We argue that mobile network operators inevitably need to cooperate in constructing a single, shared small cell network to mitigate the high deployment costs of massively deploying small cells. We also provide guidance to local and national policymakers for IoT-enabled competitive gains via the mitigation of five bottlenecks. For example, local monopolies for mmWave connectivity should be facilitated on space-limited urban furniture or risk an eventual capacity crunch, slowing down digitalization.}

For crowd dynamics modeling, previous research focused on numerical simulations and building designs with little attention to the self-rescue mechanism. It is critical to understanding crowd evacuations and better response strategies. We modeled the Grenfell Tower (a high-rise building with a complicated structure) case in 2017. Based on the percolation and social force models, we build an agent-based model to simulate individual behaviors inside. We obtain the optimal solution and robust paralleled outcomes under all counterfactual situations based on precisely matching tangible case outcomes (fire duration, deaths, and injuries). For individuals, mastering self-rescue skills is better at reducing social losses (deaths & injuries). In terms of high-rise buildings design, the central alarm system is also useful to reduce them. Besides, the crowd evacuation guided by the social force model also reduces deaths & injuries. This work provides insight into better high-rise building design and practical response strategies for societies. The central alarm system and fire-proof materials should be used in high-rise buildings. The residents should have routine training in social force-based evacuations and survival (self-rescue) skills to better the evacuation process and outcome under natural disasters and social emergencies.}

In this study, we investigate the innovations induced by immersive technologies for transportation fields. The literature (153 articles) published over the past five years were collected and analyzed systematically, pertaining to the lifecycle model of the product–service system, i.e., design, development, evaluation, and applications. The review indicated that immersive systems and scenarios have been developed and applied in various transportation areas, such as air traffic management, autonomous vehicles, railways, highways, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, the review indicated that immersive technology brings significant benefits to the transportation field and induces significant changes in the interactions between humans and the physical world. These changes are expected to induce digital transformation in several aspects, e.g., digital testbeds for theoretical models and algorithms, immersive and safe digital environments for user studies, and digital training. Based on the review, a novel framework and conceptual lifecycle model of developing immersive technology-enabled digital transformation in transportation is proposed, a novel evaluation matrix for measuring the immersive experience level is established. The results provide essential references for practitioners to apply immersive technology and guidance regarding potential future research directions.}

The XR device, which is at the core of this method, supports an interactive environment using a holographic overlay of graphical information on the spatial environment and physical objects being inspected. By leveraging this capability, a novel XR-supported inspection pipeline, called eXtended Reality-based Inspection and Visualization (XRIV), is developed. Key tasks supported by this method include detecting visual damage from sensory data acquired by the XR device, estimating its size, and visualizing (overlaying) information on the spatial environment. The crucial step of real-time interactive segmentation—detection and pixel-wise damage boundary refinement—is achieved using a feature Back-propagating Refinement Scheme (f-BRS) algorithm. Then, a ray-casting algorithm is applied to back-project the 2D image pixel coordinates of the damage region to their 3D world coordinates for damage area quantification in real-world (physical) units. Finally, the area information is overlaid and anchored to the scene containing damage for visualization and documentation. The performance of XRIV is experimentally demonstrated by measuring surface structural damage of an in-service concrete bridge with less than 10% errors for two different test cases, and image processing latency of 2–3 s (or 0.5 s per seed point) from f-BRS. The proposed XRIV pipeline underscores the advantages of real-time interaction between expert users and the XR device through immersive visualization so that a human–machine collaborative workflow can be established to obtain better inspection outcomes in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

Despite the importance of the firefighter's SA, there have been limited research efforts to understand what cues and information firefighters use to assess ongoing situations and predict future conditions. In addition to fire events, contemporary firefighters respond to an increasing volume of non-fire incidents. Thus, this study aims to identify firefighters' SA during three fire incidents (single house fire, vehicle fire, and passenger aircraft fire) and three non-fire incidents (medical emergency, hazardous materials, and urban search and rescue). A goal-directed task analysis was conducted via focus group discussions with eight career firefighters. Findings indicate that firefighters build their SA by processing various cues from hazards (e.g., fire, ignition source), humans (e.g., occupants, bystanders, drivers, passengers), spatial elements (e.g., building structure, location of hazards), and surrounding conditions (e.g., traffic, weather). Our findings provide insights into SA measurement, SA-oriented work processes, training for SA, and designing technologies to support firefighters' SA during all-hazard responses.}

While moving, the agents observe events and exchange the information collected with other agents encountered: to this end, they use messaging systems purposely adapted to use point-to-point network connections to allow local data exchange between agents even when global network connections are not available. As is common in Delay Tolerant Networks, exchanged messages are locally stored: when a global network is available, the agents can upload all the information collected by themselves and other agents they encountered to a Control Room or a database in the Cloud. Differently from traditional DTN algorithms such as Epidemic and Spray&Wait, we propose a solution that keeps track of agents that shared information along the path and assess the quality of the information collected by multiple agents through a reputation-based mechanism that is safer than majority voting. A simulator compatible with OpenStreetMap is presented, as well as simulated experiments in two Italian towns to validate the feasibility of the approach.}

In this paper we detail the design and implementation of a deep-learning based CEM classifier, leveraging existing pornography detection methods to overcome infrastructure and corpora limitations in this field. Specifically, we further existing research through direct access to numerous contemporary, real-world, annotated cases taken from Australian Federal Police holdings, demonstrating the dangers of overfitting due to the influence of individual users' proclivities. We quantify the performance of skin tone analysis in CEM cases, showing it to be of limited use. We assess the performance of our classifier and show it to be sufficient for use in forensic triage and ‘early warning’ of CEM, but of limited efficacy for categorising against existing scales for measuring child abuse severity. We identify limitations currently faced by researchers and practitioners in this field, whose restricted access to training material is exacerbated by inconsistent and unsuitable annotation schemas. Whilst adequate for their intended use, we show existing schemas to be unsuitable for training machine learning (ML) models, and introduce a new, flexible, objective, and tested annotation schema specifically designed for cross-jurisdictional collaborative use. This work, combined with a world-first ‘illicit data airlock’ project currently under construction, has the potential to bring a ‘ground truth’ dataset and processing facilities to researchers worldwide without compromising quality, safety, ethics and legality.}

Some aspects of Ubiquitous Computing from an automatic control perspective and its relation to mixed reality, augmented reality and pervasive computing will be covered. Several problems like geometric representation, extensible computing, scalability, movable interactions, integration of various network-technologies, user interface design for multi-modality, design methodologies and evaluation techniques, security/privacy issues and enabling software concepts are touched and it will be speculated about how Ubiquitous Computing might influence Low Cost Advanced Manufacturing and how experiences from the automation and control field might influence the emerging community.}

abstract = {The structural deterioration of urban underground pipe networks is the accumulated combined effects of physical, environmental and operational factors during the whole lifecycle. Accurate on-site locating and mapping of pipes and their conditions has been a great challenge for construction, maintenance and emergency response in a dynamic manner. Existing approaches, mostly based on design-centric and static visualization, are unsuitable for implementation within the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase because they are performed in a completely virtual environment and are unable to interact with buried assets on site. An integrated hyperrealistic visualization framework based on mobile augmented reality (MAR) is developed to support various real-life project tasks for O&M support of urban underground pipe networks. The proposed approach consists of three parts: a cloud-based data management platform, a 3D visualization development platform, and a location-based registration method for MAR. A cloud–edge–mobile layer is proposed to manage, analyze, process and visualize multisource data, especially for dynamic data. Field experiments on a real-life urban gas pipe network were carried out to investigate the feasibility of the proposed framework to achieve informed O&M support. The results demonstrate that (1) a smartphone linked to a Lite RTK device allows for both accurate locating and easy operation; (2) both the 3D virtual digital model and the multisource data visually superimpose onto the realistic environment, enabling on-site human–machine interaction in a hyperrealistic manner; and (3) MAR-based immersive visualization contributes to avoiding excavation damage, improving O&M efficiency and assisting emergency responders to make timely and better–informed decisions based on multisource information fusion.}

As such, the general public writ-large has had to wrestle with the colonization of publicly funded space, and the outcomes to each of our personal lives as a result of the massive harvesting and storing of our data, and the potential machine learning and processing applied to that data. Facebook, once content to harvest our data through its website, cookies, and apps on mobile phones and computers, has now planned to follow us more deeply into the Commons by developing new mapping technology combined with smart camera equipped Augmented Reality (AR) eyeglasses, that will track, render and record the Commons—and us with it. The resulting data will privately benefit Facebook's continued goal to expand its worldwide reach and growth. In this paper, we examine the ethical implications of Facebook's Project Aria research pilot through the perspectives of Responsible Innovation, comparing both existing understandings of Responsible Research and Innovation and Facebook's own Responsible Innovation Principles; we contextualise Project Aria within the Commons through applying current social multi-dimensional communications theory to understand the extensive socio-technological implications of Project Aria within society and culture; and we address the potentially serious consequences of the Facebook Project Aria experiment, inspiring countless other companies to shift their focus to compete with Project Aria, or beat it to the consumer marketplace.}

The lack of predictive safety systems that notify workers of upcoming dangers in advance is a major reason to blame in the highway maintenance and operation community. This article presents an integrative design framework for bringing recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the safety of highway workers through real-time multimodal notifications on-spot. To this end, this article conceptualizes and co-designs three major pillars: (1) AR user interface design for multimodal notification, (2) real-time AI at the edge for vehicle detection/classification from distance, and (3) real-time wireless communication in work zone setting to enable latency-aware operation between AI and AR components. Our early results demonstrate that we can achieve 24.83 FPS end-to-end execution latency on the Xavier AGX Jetson board with 48.7% mAP on BDD100K dataset, and a real-time communication covering 120 meters with an average latency of 5.1 ms at the farthest distance. Our mixed-method user research also reveals an acceptable level of excitement and engagement from the body of highway workers toward both the proposed technology and the designed user interface. Overall, this article provides a proof-of-concept toward AI-enabled AR safety systems in highway work zones.}

abstract = {Attributed to the advances in sensing and visualization technologies, novel wayfinding assistive systems are becoming more accessible such as the augmented reality (AR)-based wayfinding guidance that provides immersive information about the space and environments. However, the excessive information provided by these new methods results in cognitive overload, leading to subpar performance. Especially for emergency wayfinding where responders need to process a large amount of information while performing search and hazard identification tasks, an overdesigned wayfinding user interface and excessive information can cause confusion or disorientation among responders. This study proposes and tests a real-time cognition-driven navigation assistive system for emergency wayfinding called CogDNA. CogDNA measures responders’ real-time cognitive load and mental status based on the high-frequent pupillometer and gazes tracking data. Then the elements and formats of the primary wayfinding information are adjusted based on the individualized cognitive load models and the mental fatigue status measured by the pupillometer data including gaze movement entropy and blink rate. To test the efficacy of CogDNA, a human-subject experiment (n = 31) was performed with local firefighters in a simulated emergency wayfinding task. Three conditions were presented including the control condition with a static wayfinding system, a self-adaption condition where responders could adjust information with gesture controls, and the auto-adaption condition that tailored information based on real-time cognitive load and mental status measures. The result shows that the proposed method reduces the workload and improves the performance of the responders during the wayfinding task. The self-reported assessments also indicate benefits of the proposed method in cognitive load. The findings prove the efficacy of adaptive wayfinding information systems based on real-time cognitive load measures for future emergency wayfinding tasks.}

Increasingly, sensory data techniques are moving towards more dynamic aspects of sensory perception, taking account of the various stages of user-product interactions. Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.
Industrial relevance
The need for sensory evaluation within the food industry is becoming increasingly complex as companies continuously compete for consumer product acceptance in today's highly innovative and global food environment. Recent technological developments in virtual and augmented reality offer the food industry new opportunities for generating more reliable insights into consumer sensory perceptions of food and beverages, contributing to the design and development of new products with optimised consumer benefits. These technologies also hold significant potential for improving the predictive validity of newly launched products within the marketplace.}

The purpose of the present research was to develop an augmented reality paediatric first aid training system to investigate the effects of such a system on the knowledge, skill levels, and self-confidence of nursing students in first-aid practices.
Objective
This controlled experiment was conducted at a junior college. Ninety-five fourth-year nursing students participated in this study; 46 in the experimental group and 49 in the control group.
Design and methods
Data were collected using the Paediatric First Aid Knowledge Scale, Visual Analogue Scale of Self-Confidence and First Aid Practice Evaluation Checklist and pre- and post-test analyses were performed. The experimental group used the augmented reality application for paediatric first aid training, while the control group used a traditional method.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference between the students' pre-test scores in both groups, indicating that the students had similar levels of knowledge of paediatric first aid before the intervention. The post-test of the paediatric first aid knowledge results showed that students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group (p < .05). A significant difference was found in the first aid skills between the groups (p < .001). Additionally, the students in the experimental group stated that the augmented reality application significantly improved their self-confidence in performing paediatric emergency care (p < .001).
Conclusions
The augmented reality application had a positive effect on the knowledge and skill levels of nursing students regarding first aid practices. This study suggests that augmented reality is a valuable teaching tool in many areas of nursing education.}

Moreover, recent results and industrial proofs of concept show that these technologies demonstrate critical advantages in the industry. Nevertheless, the authoring and editing process of virtual and augmented content remains time-consuming, especially in complex industrial scenarios. While the use of interactive virtual environments through virtual and augmented reality presents new possibilities for many domains, a wider adoption of VR/AR is possible only if the authoring process is simplified, allowing for more rapid development and configuration without the need for advanced IT skills. To meet this goal, this study presents a new framework: INTERVALES. First, framework architecture is proposed, along with its different modules; this study then shows that the framework can be updated by not only IT workers, but also other job experts. The UML data model is presented to format and simplify the authoring processes for both VR and AR. This model takes into account virtual and augmented environments, the possible interactions, and ease operations orchestration. Finally, this paper presents the implementation of an industrial use case composed of collaborative robotic (cobotic) and manual assembly workstations in VR and AR based on INTERVALES data.}

abstract = {Objective
To test six different methods of directing a user's attention in a peripheral head mounted display assisted visual search task.
Background
Each time a user needs to shift their attention between virtual information and their environment has a cost. The faster a user can process a guiding cue and the fewer times they need to return to it, the more efficient that cue will be at directing a user's attention. The most effective method, creating a visual effect at the location of the target, is not suitable for peripheral head mounted displays. This study tests alternative guiding cues better suited to these devices.
Method
Participants searched for a singleton target hidden among 299 distractors while directed with one of six device-delivered guiding cues. Search times were recorded.
Results
A static region map was the most efficient and most preferred cue. Static and dynamic directional cues were also effective in comparison to non-guided search. Cues designed to work solely within the participants’ peripheral vision were relatively ineffective
Conclusion
Guidance cues that direct a user's attention to targets within the real environment do not need to precisely lead to the target. It is instead more efficient to lead a user to the general vicinity of the target quickly and then have the user revert to their natural visual search behaviour.
Application
This finding is broadly useful when assisting visual search tasks with handheld or worn devices which do not cover the user's full field of view.
Précis
This study tested six different methods of guiding attention in a peripheral head-mounted display assisted visual search task. This study compared static, dynamic and peripheral-vision endogenous cues to targets and found a static simple map cue both fastest and most preferred by users.}

abstract = {The edge computing paradigm enhances the exploitability of cloud computing by providing, in principle, the means to overcome the limitations in terms of responsiveness, bandwidth needs, privacy and availability in critical applications. By moving some of the components of the system towards the physical location where results are timely needed, it is possible to support mission critical applications and back them up with the flexibility and the resource availability and scalability offered by the cloud, while keeping mission costs lower (and response efficiency higher) than classical approaches. The main challenge in merging cloud and edge components lies in their correct balance to allow for the best results at the lowest costs. This means that performance-oriented evaluation models are crucial in the design, deployment and execution phases of the system lifetime. In this paper we present a modeling approach for complex, critical-edge computing-based systems relying on the use of queuing networks, applied to a novel architecture aiming at supporting operations in case of medium or large-scale accidents that involve interoperability among responders during the emergency phase. The proposed architecture allows the coordination of fire brigade teams, equipped with sensors and augmented reality devices, to minimize mission problems and timely exploit local and external information, as well as supporting interoperations with other first responders. The results show that, even with a standard modeling approach, these systems are extremely interesting and show non-trivial behaviors. Security and dependability issues of the proposed architecture are discussed.}

These technologies may be able to overcome main drawbacks of traditional evacuation drills bringing down cost and reducing the disruptiveness of evacuation training. However, great inconsistencies in measuring performance of trainees and lack of reasoning in the design of training programmes impede conclusions that go beyond qualitative trends.

The response procedure for different single hazards were investigated and formulated before. However, the investigations of disaster scenario rarely systematically address the entire development and response process of multi-hazards, including the coupling mechanisms, evolution dynamics, scenario assessment and emergency response. To this end, this paper presents our methodology of multi-hazard disaster scenario that integrates experiment–simulation–field data, focusing on three dimensions consisting of multi-hazard coupling, structures and systems, and emergency management. The newly proposed scenario method mainly comprises three aspects: experiments and simulations, multi-hazard field investigation, scenario analysis and response. Specifically, in order to study the large-scale, high-intensity and multi-hazard coupling effects, we carried out reduced-scale experiments and field measurement experiments to develop experimental similarity theory and prototype simulations of multi-hazards. In addition, a variety of field rescue and survey equipment, such as robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) technologies were utilized to acquire real-time data of multi-hazard field. Furthermore, we also examine the mechanism and framework of multi-hazard scenarios to formulate the detailed procedures of management and response. They are incorporated with the experiments, simulations, field data and models to construct a new scenario platform. The proposed scenario method was applied in a case study of the coupled wind and snow multi-hazard to verify its effectiveness. The new method contributes to the disaster relief, decision-making and emergency management for multi-hazard disaster to improve the urban resilience.}

Through providing on-demand visual and auditory cues while walking,augmented reality (AR) can theoretically cue spatiotemporal gait adaptations in, populations such as those with Parkinson’s disease. However, given the novelty of the, technology, the type and extent of gait adaptations in response to such a cueing, system are unknown. Before such systems can be incorporated into rehabilitation, approaches, it is important to understand how people interact with the technology. Research questions: What are the effects of visual and auditory cues delivered, through AR on spatiotemporal walking patterns and variability in a healthy, young, population? Is there a relationship between system usability and gait variability?,
Methods
Twenty healthy, young participants walked in four different cueing conditions using an AR headset: No Cues (NC) (i.e., natural gait), Auditory (A), Visual (V), and Auditory + Visual (AV). Inertial measurement units recorded spatiotemporal gait data at 200 Hz, a System Usability Survey was administered afterward, and linear regression models were developed to examine whether gait variability is predictive of system usability.
Results
All cueing conditions exhibited a significantly slower cadence compared to, NC trials. Cadence variability was significantly higher for A trials compared to V and, NC. V trials exhibited significantly decreased stride lengths compared to NC. Increased, reported system usability was significantly correlated with decreased stance phase, time variability across A trials.
Significance
Our findings support that holographic spatial-visual and auditory cues, are promising to evoke spatiotemporal gait adaptations. Results also support the, notion that the type of system and cue delivery design may impact gait outcomes.,Before an AR cueing system can be applied to a specific population in future, interventions, a more holistic approach towards finding the relationship between this, technology and its users is needed.}

abstract = {Fog computing offers low-latency and real-time big-data processing capabilities closer to the network edge. This particular benefit addresses the main bottleneck in a centralized cloud framework, which is, it cannot process latency-sensitive large video frames generated from the Internet of Things-based video surveillance cameras in real-time. Besides, the recent advancements in the computer vision field offer many state-of-the-art image processing capabilities that can be utilized for real-time surveillance data processing. Deploying those processing powers at several fog computing layers can bring novel solutions for computer vision-based real-time security solutions. This paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for smart video surveillance that can process the real-time frames on two consecutive fog layers, one for action recognition and the other for criminal threat-based response generation. The proposed architecture consists of three major modules. The first module is responsible for capturing surveillance videos by deploying RaspberryPi cameras in a distributed network. The second module is responsible for action recognition using a deep learning-based model installed inside NVIDIA Jetson Nano-devices placed on two fog layers. Finally, the security response is generated and broadcast to the law-enforcement agency. To evaluate the proposed model, experiments on semantic segmentation-based scene object recognition were run. The experimental results came up with a suitable recognition model that can be deployed in the fog layers of our proposed framework.}

Augmented Reality technology’s capabilities will make classes more interactive and knowledgeable. We all are 3D creatures. Our brain is the most powerful 3D computer technology in the world. All of us have evolved to think and store memory in 3-dimensions i.e when we look at the information in a flat piece of paper or computer screen, our brain takes its own time to translate it back to a 2D visual and store it. This is how our education system is, it started with textbook material and recently educators have started encouraging the use of smart classes which again shows videos. As a result, there is no practical exposure that lags us a step behind. This is where a promising technology of the future called Augmented Reality holds for us. Learners will have a 360-degree view of the real-world entities, interacting with those entities by touching them which will eventually make them have better insight about the concepts. Hence our learning curve decreases increasing the brain's productivity. With the development of smartphones, Augmented Reality is applied to a broader range. Augmented reality can turn an ordinary classroom into an engaging experience. The aim is to implement an interactive Augmented Reality Experience using Vuforia, Unity 3D and Blender. The purpose is to promote situational learning, experimental learning, transformative learning as the learning theory basis of mobile Augmented Reality.}

This work presents a preliminary prototype that enables the extinguishing of a fire on a container ship as a VR training scenario. The prototype provides a full-body and multi-user VR experience, based on the synthesis of position data provided by the motion capture system and orientation data from the VR headsets. As a consequence, the prototype allows an initial evaluation of results. The results confirm the value of using VR to train procedures that are difficult to train in the real world. Furthermore, the results show that motion capture based VR technologies are particularly useful for firefighting training, in which participants can collaborate in otherwise difficult-to-access environments.

Most existing research in AR-based wayfinding has focused on the technological aspects of developing AR-based software or devices to realize navigation. No previous investigations have focused on understanding the impact of immersive augmented reality (IAR)–based systems on human wayfinding performance from the cognitive perspective. Aimed at investigating the influence of IAR-based systems on people’s cognitive map development and their subsequent wayfinding performance as well as the effect of using three-dimensional (3D) layout models in IAR environments in addition to superimposed guideposts, an experiment was carried out in a building with a complex floor plan. A total of 54 university students were evenly divided into three groups: a control group with no IAR assistance, a second group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes only superimposed guideposts, and a third group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes both guideposts and a 3D layout model. Each participant was asked to conduct a spatial exploration task in the environment, sketch a floor map based on their spatial cognition, and perform a wayfinding task to find eight specific locations in the building. An analysis of the participants’ performance and responses to a number of self-evaluation questionnaires collected in the experiment indicates that IAR technology can help people develop their cognitive maps more effectively and can substantially improve their wayfinding performance with a much lower workload. A second finding is that adding a 3D layout model can enhance the effect of an IAR-based navigation system in terms of cognitive map development. The findings from this research extend the existing knowledge about IAR-based navigation and further verify that AR technology has the potential to reduce human workload for cognitive tasks. The results also could support its more effective application in various scenarios that require assisted wayfinding and cognitive map training, such as emergency evacuation drills.}

Involving laypersons in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through mobile-phone technology is becoming widespread in numerous countries, and different solutions were developed. We performed a systematic review on the impact of alerting citizens as first responders and to provide an overview of different strategies and technologies used.
Methods
We searched electronic databases up to October 2019. Eligible studies described systems to alert citizens first responders to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through text messages or apps. We analyzed the implementation and performance of these systems and their impact on patients’ outcomes.
Results
We included 28 manuscripts describing 12 different systems. The first text message system was implemented in 2006 and the first app in 2010. First responders accepted to intervene in median (interquartile) 28.7% (27–29%) of alerts and reached the scene after 4.6 (4.4–5.5) minutes for performing CPR. First responders arrived before ambulance, started CPR and attached a defibrillator in 47% (34–58%), 24% (23–27%) and 9% (6–14%) of cases, respectively. Pooled analysis showed that first responders activation increased layperson-CPR rates (1463/2292 [63.8%] in the intervention group vs. 1094/1989 [55.0%] in the control group; OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11–2.60; p = 0.01) and survival to hospital discharge or at 30 days (327/2273 [14.4%] vs. 184/1955 [9.4%]; OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.24–1.84; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Alerting citizens as first responders in case of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may reduce the intervention-free time and improve patients’ outcomes.}

However, threats are also prevalent, with crimes such as child sexual exploitation and privacy violations occurring in metaverses that mimic reality, making digital forensics for metaverse threats essential. Nevertheless, technical standards for different types of metaverses have yet to be defined, making investigation difficult. Furthermore, even though metaverses are complex forms that combine multiple hardware devices and software applications, existing studies have either focused on a single component or not analyzed the real-world environment. In this study, we derived a metaverse ecosystem with common components that comprise a metaverse and analyzed the hardware and software used throughout the user's metaverse lifecycle from a digital forensics perspective. In particular, we applied real-case-based scenario to the metaverse environment of the most popular Meta's currently in use to identify various artifacts that can be used across the ecosystem and validate the effectiveness of the process. We also developed a metaverse digital forensics tool for the first time in the current situation where open-source and commercial tools do not support metaverse investigations.}

Within the medical profession, simulation techniques have been used extensively by anesthesiologists for individual and teamwork training tasks. Following the example in anesthesiology, simulation curricula are being developed for teaching and evaluating core competencies for surgical and emergency medicine residents, prehospital personnel, and medical students. Simulation models can be as simple as static mannequins for procedural skills or as complex as high-fidelity human patient simulators that react physiologically to administered medications and provider actions. As this technology continues to mature, benefits of incorporating such safe and valuable education to trainees across all medical disciplines and training levels must be considered in light of the expense of such endeavors. Benefits of simulation training within the medical field include learning and perfecting procedural skills before patient interaction, participating in rare or complicated case scenarios which might otherwise not be encountered in traditional training, and nonprocedural training such as teamwork training and disaster management skills. As efforts continue to emerge to increase patient safety and reduce medical errors, simulation has become more popular in promoting patient autonomy while allowing trainees to experience positive and negative outcomes with the opportunity for constructive feedback, or debriefing, afterward.}

These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0. The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training.}

The goal of this research is to address challenges encountered in the current practice for structural engineers and first responders to inspect and disseminate building damage assessments and resource requests more efficiently to support US&R. The SUPER-MAN system is equipped with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, as the storage device of assessment information on the disaster site, and a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) with a Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) implementation for communication. SUPER-MAN strengthens responders’ situational awareness, reduces confusion of inconsistent assessment formats, and automates information dissemination and editing. As a result, lifesaving operations are adequately prioritized, risk of first responders are minimized, and requests of response resources are facilitated. Results obtained from field trials carried out at the Illinois Fire Service Institute with a simulated disaster scenario and computer simulations of the MANET are presented to highlight the benefits provided by SUPER-MAN.}

Nevertheless, once a detection model trained on generic datasets (such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO) is applied to a specific scene, its precision is limited by the distribution gap between the generic data and the specific scene data. It is difficult to train the model for a specific scene, due to the lack of labeled data from that scene. Even though we manage to get some labeled data from a specific scene, the changing environmental conditions make the pre-trained model perform bad. In light of these issues, we propose a parallel vision approach to scene-specific pedestrian detection. Given an object detection model, it is trained via two sequential stages: (1) the model is pre-trained on augmented-reality data, to address the lack of scene-specific training data; (2) the pre-trained model is incrementally optimized with newly synthesized data as the specific scene evolves over time. On publicly available datasets, our approach leads to higher precision than the models trained on generic data. To tackle the dynamically changing scene, we further evaluate our approach on the webcam data collected from Church Street Market Place, and the results are also encouraging.}

The state-of-the-art technologies such as sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) may offer great potential to improve building fire safety and rescue efficiency, primarily through ameliorating the level of situational awareness. This study proposes an innovative technology integrated framework for prototyping a proof-of-concept BIM, IoT and AR/VR system based upon the rationale of situational awareness. A pilot test based on a simulated fire scenario is conducted to evaluate the functionality of the framework. The outcomes reveal that the data generated by the system can be leveraged by the firefighting department to quickly locate the whereabouts of the indoor fires, and the VR gamification scenarios can expedite the development of situational awareness for the trainees. The limitations and future works are also discussed at the end of this paper.}

To bridge this gap in the literature, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of cD2D communication. We commence by introducing cD2D communication and highlighting the key research challenges in this field. Subsequently, we categorize the recent advancements in cD2D communications into eight major types of techniques and provide an in-depth review of the existing literature. Furthermore, we address several significant challenges associated with cD2D communications and discuss future applications that can benefit from this technology. Through our analysis, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of cD2D communication and provide insights into its potential for various domains.}

abstract = {Chemical images which are often computed from hyperspectral images contain the spatial distribution of chemical information of a scene. For many applications visualizing such images on computer screens is sufficient, however there are cases where there is a need to combine the chemical images more naturally with human vision. This is especially true for interactive work where chemical images are being rapidly updated to the user. Effective integration of spatial information in general from external sources with vision is a challenge. One approach is to overlay the view of the real physical world with computer-generated graphics as in augmented reality. However such cluttering of the visual field with computer-generated graphics may confuse the user and reduce functionality. Another is projecting the chemical images back onto the scene under study in order to render the chemical information in situ to the user. This approach, however has challenges in connection with very small and very large scenes under investigation. An alternative approach is here investigated based on the possibility of enhancing the human vision system using a sensory substitution device. Such devices enables a person to sense spatial information conveyed through sensory channels other than the eye, such as hearing and sense of touch. Results presented support the claim that spatial chemical information from a hyperspectral camera can be conveyed to the brain through a sensory channel different from the eyes. As this is tested on a sighted subject it effectively provides an extension of the human vision system to incorporate chemical information which otherwise is invisible to the naked eye.}

However, there is a paucity of comprehensive research examining their role across all stages of urban flood risk management. To address, this study conducts an integrated critical review to identify the application of CDVT and assess their contribution to the prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery stages of flood risk management. The results show that virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital twin technologies are the primary CDVT used in urban flood visualisation, with virtual reality being the most frequently used. The focus of urban flood visualisation studies has been primarily on preparation and mitigation stages. However, there is a need to investigate the application of these technologies in the entire urban water cycle. Furthermore, there is potential for greater adoption of digital twin, especially in simulating urban flood inundation and flood evacuation routes. Integrating real-time data, data-driven modeling, and CDVT can significantly improve real-time flood forecasting. This benefits stakeholders and the public by enhancing early warning systems, preparedness, and flood resilience, leading to more effective flood risk management and reduced impacts on communities.}

abstract = {Mobile augmented reality systems (MARS) have the potential to revolutionize the way in which information is provided to users. Virtual information can be directly integrated with the real world surrounding the mobile user, who can interact with it to display related information, to pose and resolve queries, and to collaborate with other users. However, we believe that the benefits of MARS will only be achieved if the user interface (UI) is actively managed so as to maximize the relevance and minimize the confusion of the virtual material relative to the real world. This article addresses some of the steps involved in this process, focusing on the design and layout of the mobile user's overlaid virtual environment. The augmented view of the user's surroundings presents an interface to context-dependent operations, many of which are related to the objects in view—the augmented world is the user interface. We present three UI design techniques that are intended to make this interface as obvious and clear to the user as possible: information filtering, UI component design, and view management. Information filtering helps select the most relevant information to present to the user. UI component design determines the format in which this information should be conveyed, based on the available display resources and tracking accuracy. For example, the absence of high accuracy position tracking would favor body- or screen-stabilized components over world-stabilized ones that would need to be exactly registered with the physical objects to which they refer. View management attempts to ensure that the virtual objects that are displayed visually are arranged appropriately with regard to their projections on the view plane. For example, the relationships among objects should be as unambiguous as possible, and physical or virtual objects should not obstruct the user's view of more important physical or virtual objects in the scene. We illustrate these interface design techniques using our prototype collaborative, cross-site MARS environment, which is composed of mobile and non-mobile augmented reality and virtual reality systems.}

The insufficient number of radio channels and the impossibility to deliver digital information force firemen to improvise during response processes, e.g., to make decisions using their experience and poor or null supporting information. These improvised actions affect the time required to take control of an emergency, and also affect the evolution of the crisis situation. Provided most of Latin American fire companies are volunteer organizations, communication solutions that could help to overcome these problems are usually expensive for them. This article presents a low-cost mobile collaborative application, which may be used in emergency situations to overcome most of the firefighters’ communication problems. The application, named MobileMap, is the result of the research and development work conducted by the authors, supported by a Chilean fire company, during the last three years. MobileMap allows ad hoc communication, decisions support and collaboration among firefighters in the field using mobile devices. This solution complements the radio communication systems. Since the interactions supported by MobileMap are recorded, it is possible to analyze such information after the crisis and learn for future emergencies. The tool was evaluated in simulated and real scenarios, and the obtained results are highly encouraging.}

Awareness of a user's context (such as user profile, role, preferences, task, and existing project conditions) can enhance the construction project delivery process by providing a mechanism to determine information relevant to a particular context. Context awareness can also be used to improve security, logistics and health and safety practices on construction sites. Location is an important aspect of context awareness. A location aware application can utilize the knowledge of the user/object location to provide relevant information and services. This paper argues that a successful and reliable location tracking system must be able to track a user's spatial context and deliver contextual data continuously in both outdoor and indoor environments to effectively support construction projects. Research describing the use of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) for indoor tracking and Global Positioning System (GPS) for outdoor spatial context tracking is presented, and an integrated tracking technique using WLAN and GPS for ubiquitous location sensing is introduced. The key benefits and technical challenges of such an integrated approach are also highlighted. The presented tracking techniques have been validated in both indoor and outdoor environments to ensure their practical implementation on real construction jobsites.}

It explores their willingness to download for free or purchase such an app, their impression of features that an app might include such as revealing their location, how they would rate police force monitoring if included as a feature of the app and finally how they would rate a personal safety app against other technologies used to improve perceived transport user safety. The results show that the majority of respondents would consider downloading a personal safety app. Lower levels of engagement with technology, a higher level of education, being resident in the city of Dublin (as opposed to surrounding regions) and privacy concerns tended to make females less likely to consider downloading the app. These findings were not repeated for males. The results suggest that younger respondents were more likely to be negatively impacted by the inclusion of a facility to report location in an emergency on the app, while the older age groups were more likely to be unaffected. For the location tracking feature, cluster membership, gender and resident outside Dublin were significant. Less than half of the respondents would be negatively influenced in their decision to buy the app if a cost of €1.79 were introduced. When respondents were asked about the inclusion of police monitoring as a feature of the app, the results suggested that police monitoring had a more definite effect on perceived personal safety than on privacy.}

The framework can generate realistic simulations of desired locations entailing the terrain, elevation model, infrastructures, dynamic visualizations (e.g. water and fire simulation), and information layers (e.g. disaster damages and extent, sensor readings, occupancy, traffic, weather). These layers enable in-situ visualization of useful data to aid public, scientists, officials, and decision-makers in acquiring a bird's eye view of the current, historical, or forecasted condition of a community. The framework incorporates multiuser support to allow different stakeholders to remotely work on the same VR environment and observe other users' actions and 3D positions via avatars in real-time, and thus, presenting the potential to be utilized as a virtual incident command center or a meeting room. GeospatialVR's purpose is to enhance existing web-based cyberinfrastructure systems with the integration of immersive geospatial capabilities to assist the development of next-generation information and decision support systems powered by virtual reality. Finally, several case studies have been developed for flooding, wildfire, transportation, and public safety.}

Seamless sharing of information among users using Social networking provides for a unique type of sensor. This human-as-a sensor is already deployed in the field and only requires harvesting of the information to glean ground truth. Further, the proliferation of the smartphones and their connectivity networks has powered the ordinary individuals to share and acquire information regarding the events happening in his/her immediate vicinity in a real-time fashion. The information provided by these sensors is already annotated with descriptions such as “urgency” “critically wounded” which normally would not be found in traditional machine based sensors. Further, when appropriately employed this real-time data can support in detecting localized events like fire, accidents, shooting, etc…, as they unfold and pin-point individuals being affected by those events. The spatio-temporal information can be indexed, grouped and deployed on Smartphones and other devices that first responders can use in the field to augment decision making. In this vein, under SATE and YATE programs, the research team at AFRL TecˆEdge Discovery labs had demonstrated the feasibility of developing Smartphone applications, that can provide a augmented reality view of the appropriate detected events in a given geographical location (localized) and also provide an event search capability over a large geographic extent. In its current state, the application thru its backend connectivity utilizes a data (Text & Image) processing framework, which deals with data challenges like; identifying and aggregating important events, analyzing and correlating the events temporally and spatially and building a search enabled event database. Further, the smartphone application with its backend data processing workflow has been successfully field tested with live user generated feeds.}

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of extended reality systems and the metaverse with emphasis on technology weaknesses, cyber security challenges and users’ safety concerns. Five major taxonomies have been presented in this research with an aim of identifying privacy inference vectors and potential cyber threats; determining the impact on human health and the extent to which cyberstalking, and digital currency scam activities proliferate when using XR. This research also proposes strategies for primary lines of defense and provides recommendations on the adoption of safety measures.}

This paper takes a game-theoretical approach to the psychology, behaviour, and welfare of pedestrians, who experience different levels of mutualised anxiety and confidence in spontaneous encounters with strangers on the road. Through a combined method of survey, modelling, and theory, it proposes an equilibrium-analysis of inter-pedestrian signalling, as well as a set of public policy recommendations aimed to reduce unnecessary frictions, improve information transparency, and therefore promote public safety.}

It has a broad vision with well-defined frameworks and reference designs, focusing on bridging physical infrastructure and digital technology in so-called cyber-physical systems. Apart from the other essential technologies, Holography is considered a new innovative technology that can completely transform the vision of Industry 4.0. In industrial applications, holographic technology is used for quality control in manufacturing and fracture testing, such as holographic nondestructive testing. Holography has a wide range of applications in medicine, the military, weather forecasting, virtual reality, digital art, and security. The fourth industrial revolution aims to provide automated asset monitoring, decision-making for corporate operations, and real-time network connectivity. This paper explores holography and its significant benefits through various development processes, features, and applications, where the focus is on ‘holography for Industry 4.0'. Hologram technology is a new industry trend and can impact multiple domains of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the adoption of holographic technologies may improve the efficiency of existing products and services in other technology sectors such as architecture, 3D modelling, mechatronics, robotics, and healthcare and medical engineering.}

The current position paper examines this challenge from the viewpoint of scientific experts. Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.}

Basic life support education for schoolchildren has become a key initiative to increase bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rates. Our objective was to review the existing literature on teaching schoolchildren basic life support to identify the best practices to provide basic life support training in schoolchildren.
METHODS
After topics and subgroups were defined, a comprehensive literature search was conducted. Systematic reviews and controlled and uncontrolled prospective and retrospective studies containing data on students <20 years of age were included.
RESULTS
Schoolchildren are highly motivated to learn basic life support. The CHECK-CALL-COMPRESS algorithm is recommended for all schoolchildren. Regular training in basic life support regardless of age consolidates long-term skills. Young children from 4 years of age are able to assess the first links in the chain of survival. By 10 to 12 years of age, effective chest compression depths and ventilation volumes can be achieved on training manikins. A combination of theoretical and practical training is recommended. Schoolteachers serve as effective basic life support instructors. Schoolchildren also serve as multipliers by passing on basic life support skills to others. The use of age-appropriate social media tools for teaching is a promising approach for schoolchildren of all ages.
CONCLUSIONS
Schoolchildren basic life support training has the potential to educate whole generations to respond to cardiac arrest and to increase survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Comprehensive legislation, curricula, and scientific assessment are crucial to further develop the education of schoolchildren in basic life support.}

Previous research has generated knowledge about controversies in digital platform innovations. However, this work mainly focuses on the types of controversies and their effects rather than on the process of controversy emergence. In this article, we analyze how controversies related to digital platform innovation emerge and how they unfold over the innovation process. We analyze the case of the Google Glass failure to establish this ARSG (Augmented Reality Smart Glasses) extension to Google's digital platform. The paper contributes to the study of controversies by analyzing the digital platform innovation process as a process of translation, in which there are possible controversy emergence points originated in types of disagreements among the different human actors involved and their interactions with non-human elements. These disagreements are related to specific features of digital platforms: the digital platform generativity, the multisided market arrangements in the platform; the loosely coupled layers of technologies and applications involved, and the opaqueness that results from these arrangements. The framework proposed can support digital platform scholars and practitioners to in better understand and manage controversies.}

During this phase, system designers need to accurately elicit, model and validate the desired system based on user requirements. Smart driver assistive technologies (SDAT) belong to a class of complex systems that are used to alleviate accident risk by improving situation awareness, reducing driver workload or enhancing driver attentiveness. Such systems aim to draw drivers’ attention on critical information cues that improve decision making. Discovering the requirements for such systems necessitates a holistic approach that addresses not only functional and non-functional aspects but also the human requirements such as drivers’ situation awareness and workload. This work describes a simulation-based user requirements discovery method. It utilizes the benefits of a modular virtual reality simulator to model driving conditions to discover user needs that subsequently inform the design of prototype SDATs that exploit the augmented reality method. Herein, we illustrate the development of the simulator, the elicitation of user needs through an experiment and the prototype SDAT designs using UNITY game engine.}

Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept. Guidelines for MCT design were validated with an online survey completed by 81 police officers. Future research directions were proposed to recognize police officer needs and work context.}

Efforts have been made to integrate these systems to vehicles mostly for security purposes and user authentication. Until now, most of the systems do not go beyond using facial and fingerprint data to start the engine or access the car; however, new generations demand more personalization plus the vehicle making decisions based on their physiological characteristics. Although this kind of technology is considered a luxury feature in general, actually it could help users and save their lives. Indeed, biometry is the way to make the human-vehicle relationship happen, whether the biometric devices are embedded inside the vehicle, used as an accessory or wearables. By using as input not only the sensors inside the vehicle but also data from outside, the vehicle could adapt and/or learn new information to make the best possible decision.}

During building fire emergency response operations, establishment and utilization of situational awareness are of essential importance, enabling first responders, especially incident commanders, to better assess changing on-scene situations and make informed decisions. The paper uses an interactive card game to guide first responders to establish situational awareness about an imaginary building fire emergency, and examines the information items needed by first responders in this process. An evaluation of the importance of each information item is performed. The results show that location and status of occupants and first responders, and status and development of fire and smoke are the foremost important information items. Information items in the “at emergency scene” category were updated on average five times more frequently than information items in other categories. In order to investigate sources for obtaining the above information, and examine requirements for better implementing situational awareness at emergency scenes, a nationwide survey was conducted with first responders in the United States. The results point out a discrepancy between current and desired information sources for establishing situational awareness at building fire emergency scenes. The paper also reports detailed implementation requirements, including type of assistance, level of details and format of representation for establishing situational awareness, and illustrates statistical impacts of location, years of experience and job title on the requirements.}

They are essential for dealing with increasingly complex systems in unstructured, dynamic environments. The purpose of this article is to review the role of laser technology in enabling better, more precise interactions and their control, and to identify opportunities and challenges in this area. While the most common applications of laser technology are found in medical and health care, manufacturing, and communication, other domains such as safety, quality assurance, agriculture, construction, entertainment, defense, transportation, and law enforcement also benefit from it. In spite of the rapid dissemination of this technology, its role in support of collaboration and discovery is still in its infancy. Research activities concerning new ways of using lasers as a collaboration supporting technology that may strengthen new areas have been relatively limited. Nevertheless, the translation to this domain of collaboration support has been recognized as vital for activities that demand increasingly more coordinated effort among interacting agents (e.g., humans, machines, particles) and digital, possibly also photonic agents. Recent advances in laser technology in a number of application domains are reviewed in this article, focusing primarily on lasers’ role for supporting different forms of precision interactions and collaboration. In addition, a framework with five collaboration support functions and five collaboration dimensions is defined for this review. The taxonomy framework is useful for enabling better understanding of the existing and emerging opportunities that laser-based technology offers for collaboration support, its advantages and several research gaps.}

(b) From our analysis we found three major active fields for the protection of public spaces: Information Technologies, Architectural approaches, Organizational field. (c) While the academic suggest best practices and methodologies for the protection of urban areas, the market did not provide any type of implementation of such suggested approaches, which shows a lack of fertilization between academia and industry.
Conclusion:
The overall analysis has led us to state that there is no one single solution available, conversely, multiple methods and techniques can be put in place to guarantee safety and security in public spaces. The techniques range from architectural design to rethink the design of public spaces keeping security into account in continuity, to emerging technologies such as AI and predictive surveillance.}

More data can be gathered from the crisis site, arriving in a large flow of various types from multiple sources such as sensors, open data, or social media. This huge amount of data coming continuously from the crisis site leads to an ever-changing situational awareness that must be built and understood as quickly as it is evolving to ensure a relevant and effective crisis response. To build a shared situational awareness, decision-makers can gather in a room where they can share and compare the information they receive from the crisis site to build a common operational picture that they can use to make decisions and implement them: this is a crisis management cell. However, the tools in traditional crisis management cells may not be able to keep up with the new requirements induced by these changes: we need modular and dynamic tools able to adapt to the crisis and the needs of the crisis managers while ensuring collaboration and information sharing not only between the stakeholders but also with remote experts that might be needed to understand the situation. We need to start conceiving the future crisis management cell that would meet the new exigencies of crisis management. This paper proposes our version of that future crisis management cell, using virtual reality to provide a dynamic and modular crisis management cell linked to artificial intelligence and decision-support systems.}

abstract = {Aim
To analyze the effectiveness of a teaching-learning methodology for teletraining in basic life support (BLS) based on communication through smart glasses.
Design
Pilot quasi-experimental non-inferiority study.
Participants
Sixty college students.
Interventions
Randomization of the participants in: tele-training through smart glasses (SG) and traditional training (C) groups. Both training sessions were very brief (less than 8 min) and included the same BLS content. In SG, the instructor trained through a video call with smart glasses.
Main variables of interest
The BLS protocol, the use of AED, the quality of resuscitation and the response times were evaluated.
Results
In most of the BLS protocol variables, the resuscitation quality and performance times, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. There were significant differences (in favor of the SG) in the assessment of breathing (SG: 100%, C: 81%; p = 0.013), the not-to-touch warning before applying the shock (SG: 79%, C: 52%; p = 0.025) and compressions with correct recoil (SG: 85%, C: 32%; p = 0.008).
Conclusions
Laypeople BLS-AED brief tele-training through smart glasses could potentially be, at least, as effective as traditional training methods. In addition, smart glasses could be more advantageous than traditional teaching for certain points of the BLS protocol and chest compressions quality, probably due to the capability of real-time visualization of images which supports the BLS sequence. Augmented reality supported teaching should be considered for BLS training, although caution is required in extrapolating findings, and further in-depth studies are needed to confirm its potential role depending on concrete target populations and environments.
Resumen
Objetivo
Analizar la efectividad de una metodología de enseñanza-aprendizaje de teleformación en soporte vital básico (SVB) basada en la comunicación a través de smart glasses.
Diseño
Estudio piloto cuasi experimental de no inferioridad.
Participantes
Sesenta estudiantes universitarios.
Intervenciones
Aleatorización de los participantes en: grupo de teleformación a través de smart glasses (SG) y formación tradicional (C). Ambas sesiones de entrenamiento fueron muy breves (<8 minutos) e incluyeron el mismo contenido en de SVB. En SG, el entrenamiento fue comunicándose a través de una videollamada con smart glasses.
Variables de interés principales
Se evaluó el protocolo del SVB, el uso de DEA, la calidad de la reanimación y los tiempos de actuación.
Resultados
En la mayoría de las variables del protocolo del SVB, la calidad de la reanimación y los tiempos de ejecución, no hubo diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre grupos. Hubo mejor actuación de SG al valorar la respiración (SG: 100%, C: 81%; p = 0,013), el avisar antes de la descarga del DEA (SG: 79%, C: 52%; p = 0,025) y las compresiones con buena reexpansión (SG: 85%, C: 32%; p = 0,008).
Conclusiones
El tele-entrenamiento en SVB-DEA para legos con smart glasses podría llegar a ser, al menos, tan efectivo como un método tradicional de enseñanza. Además, las smart glasses podrían ser más ventajosas para ciertos aspectos del protocolo del SVB y la calidad de las compresiones, probablemente debido a la capacidad de visualización de imágenes en tiempo real. La enseñanza basada en la realidad aumentada debe considerarse para la capacitación en SVB, aunque se requiere tanto cautela en la extrapolación de hallazgos como estudios futuros con mayor profundidad.}

abstract = {With the increasing growth of internet-of-things (IoT) devices, effective computation performance has become a critical issue. Many services provided by IoT devices (e.g., augmented reality, location-tracking, traffic systems, and autonomous driving) require intensive real-time data processing, which demands powerful computational resources. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced to effectively handle this problem reliably over the internet. The inclusion of a MEC server allows computationally intensive tasks to be offloaded from IoT devices. However, communication overhead and delays are major drawbacks. With the advantages of high mobility and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can mitigate this issue by acting as MEC servers. The offloading decisions for such scenarios involve service latency, energy/power consumption, and execution delays. For this reason, this study reviews UAV-enabled MEC solutions in which offloading was the focus of research. We compare the algorithms qualitatively to assess features and performance. Finally, we discuss open issues and research challenges in terms of design and implementation.}

Laypeople should be trained in basic life support and traditional and innovative methodologies may help to obtain this goal. However, there is a knowledge gap about the ideal basic life support training methods. Smart glasses could have a role facilitating laypeople learning of basic life support.
Aim
To analyze the potential impact on basic life support learning of a very brief training supported by smart glasses video communication.
Methods
Twelve laypeople were basic life support tele-trained by means of smart glasses by an instructor in this pilot study. During training (assisted trough smart glasses) and after the training (unassisted) participants’ performance and quality of basic life support and automated external defibrillation procedure were assessed on a standardized simulated scenario.
Results
After the training all participants were able to deliver good quality basic life support, with results comparable to those obtained when real time remotely guided by the instructor through the smart glasses. Mean chest compression rate was significantly higher when not guided (113 /min vs. 103 /min, p = 0.001). When not assisted, the participants spent less time delivering the sequential basic life support steps than when assisted while training.
Conclusions
A very brief remote training supported by instructor and smart glasses seems to be an effective educational method that could facilitate basic life support learning by laypeople. This technology could be considered in cases where instructors are not locally available or in general in remote areas, providing basic internet connection is available. Smart glasses could also be useful for laypeople rolling-refreshers.}

It is a remote, non-line-of-sight sensor to detect threats more reliably and provide increased security protection, which is of utmost importance to military and law enforcement applications. However, the use of the LDV in situation surveillance, especially in vehicle classification, lacks systematic investigations as to its phenomenological and statistical properties. In this work, we aim to identify vehicles by their engine types within a very short period of time to yield a practical expert and intelligent system to classify vehicle engines remotely using laser sensors. Based on our preliminary success on the use of tone-pitch indexes (TPI) over these data, a new normalized tone-pitch indexing (nTPI) scheme is developed to capture engine periodic vibrations by various engine types with vibration data over a much shorter period (from 1.25 to 0.2 s), which makes it possible to monitor slowly moving vehicles around 15 miles per hour. We also exploit the learning power of neural computing, including artificial neural network (ANN), Deep Belief nets (DBN), Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To apply a CNN, a two-dimensional array is formulated by stacking nTPI data in an overlapping manner, which is termed as 2DonTPI. The classification results using the proposed nTPI and 2DonTPI over a standard LDV dataset are promising: with encoding duration significantly smaller than that required by the original TPI, consistently high performance is attained for all four neural computing methods. The new vibration data representation combined with neural computing approaches gives rise to a powerful expert and intelligent system for vehicle engine classification, which can find a great array of applications for civil, law enforcement, and military agencies for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance purposes that are of crucial importance to national and international security.}

This resulted in the evaluation of 67 relevant journal articles collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The review revealed that ImTs have been applied for OSH training and education in various industries including transportation, construction, mining, and healthcare. It was also revealed that the OSH hazards addressed by ImT-based training and education include but are not limited to fire, fall, electrical and chemical hazards in order to prevent or reduce injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition, it was revealed that one of the benefits of ImTs for OSH training and education is better retention of concepts when compared to conventional training and education. Challenges associated with the use of ImTs for OSH training and education include insufficient display brightness for users to effectively see virtual objects in a brightly luminated environment. Among the recommendations for future work is research into how to develop effective communication methods between trainers and trainees immersed in a virtual environment for trainers to fully understand the difficulties trainees experience in operating the developed ImT-based platform and provide solutions to such difficulties.}

abstract = {Background
A robust estimation method is needed to prevent medication dosing and equipment sizing errors and improve time to administration during paediatric resuscitation. An electronic measurement with computer interface may improve accuracy and alleviate cognitive burden. This study evaluates the accuracy of two electronic height measurement methods, a laser and an optical device, and compares them to the Broselow™ Pediatric Emergency Tape (BT) for weight estimation.
Methods
We enrolled children ages 0–14 years from the emergency department of a free-standing, academic children’s hospital. We obtained sex, body habitus, true weight, true height, BT colour, and experimental heights. We converted experimental height measurements into weight estimates using standardised growth charts. We calculated Pearson correlations between experimental and actual measurements and the percentages of weight estimates within 10% and 20% of true weights. We repeated analyses on a restricted cohort of children 0–11 years, the intended BT age range.
Results
We enrolled 198 children. The laser, optical device and BT weight estimates had strong positive correlations with the actual weight measurements with Pearson’s correlation coefficients of 0.946, p < 0.0001, 0.965, p < 0.0001, and 0.825, p < 0.0001 respectively. 47.8% of optical weight estimates fell within 10% of actual weight and 80.6% within 20%, compared to 40.5% and 75.4% of laser estimates and 39.8% and 65.1% of BT estimates.
Conclusion
Electronic-based weight estimates were more accurate than the BT. The accuracy of medication dosing and equipment sizing during paediatric resuscitation may be improved by integrating optical height-based weight estimates with electronic clinical decision support.}

Thus, wireless traffic grows in volume and complexity, making prediction, investment planning, and regulation increasingly difficult. This article characterizes urban wireless traffic evolution, supporting operators to drive mobile network evolution and policymakers to increase national and local competitiveness. We propose a holistic method that widens previous research scope, including new devices and the effect of policy from multiple government levels. We provide an analytical formulation that combines existing complementary methods on traffic evolution research and diverse data sources. Results for a centric area of Helsinki during 2020–2030 indicate that daily volumes increase, albeit a surprisingly large part of the traffic continues to be generated by smartphones. Machine traffic gains importance, driven by surveillance video cameras and connected cars. While camera traffic is sensitive to law enforcement policies and data regulation, car traffic is less affected by transport electrification policy. High-priority traffic remains small, even under encouraging autonomous vehicle policies. Based on peak hour results, we suggest that 5G small cells might be needed around 2025, albeit the utilization of novel radio technology and additional mid-band spectrum could delay this need until 2029. We argue that mobile network operators inevitably need to cooperate in constructing a single, shared small cell network to mitigate the high deployment costs of massively deploying small cells. We also provide guidance to local and national policymakers for IoT-enabled competitive gains via the mitigation of five bottlenecks. For example, local monopolies for mmWave connectivity should be facilitated on space-limited urban furniture or risk an eventual capacity crunch, slowing down digitalization.}

For crowd dynamics modeling, previous research focused on numerical simulations and building designs with little attention to the self-rescue mechanism. It is critical to understanding crowd evacuations and better response strategies. We modeled the Grenfell Tower (a high-rise building with a complicated structure) case in 2017. Based on the percolation and social force models, we build an agent-based model to simulate individual behaviors inside. We obtain the optimal solution and robust paralleled outcomes under all counterfactual situations based on precisely matching tangible case outcomes (fire duration, deaths, and injuries). For individuals, mastering self-rescue skills is better at reducing social losses (deaths & injuries). In terms of high-rise buildings design, the central alarm system is also useful to reduce them. Besides, the crowd evacuation guided by the social force model also reduces deaths & injuries. This work provides insight into better high-rise building design and practical response strategies for societies. The central alarm system and fire-proof materials should be used in high-rise buildings. The residents should have routine training in social force-based evacuations and survival (self-rescue) skills to better the evacuation process and outcome under natural disasters and social emergencies.}

In this study, we investigate the innovations induced by immersive technologies for transportation fields. The literature (153 articles) published over the past five years were collected and analyzed systematically, pertaining to the lifecycle model of the product–service system, i.e., design, development, evaluation, and applications. The review indicated that immersive systems and scenarios have been developed and applied in various transportation areas, such as air traffic management, autonomous vehicles, railways, highways, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, the review indicated that immersive technology brings significant benefits to the transportation field and induces significant changes in the interactions between humans and the physical world. These changes are expected to induce digital transformation in several aspects, e.g., digital testbeds for theoretical models and algorithms, immersive and safe digital environments for user studies, and digital training. Based on the review, a novel framework and conceptual lifecycle model of developing immersive technology-enabled digital transformation in transportation is proposed, a novel evaluation matrix for measuring the immersive experience level is established. The results provide essential references for practitioners to apply immersive technology and guidance regarding potential future research directions.}

The XR device, which is at the core of this method, supports an interactive environment using a holographic overlay of graphical information on the spatial environment and physical objects being inspected. By leveraging this capability, a novel XR-supported inspection pipeline, called eXtended Reality-based Inspection and Visualization (XRIV), is developed. Key tasks supported by this method include detecting visual damage from sensory data acquired by the XR device, estimating its size, and visualizing (overlaying) information on the spatial environment. The crucial step of real-time interactive segmentation—detection and pixel-wise damage boundary refinement—is achieved using a feature Back-propagating Refinement Scheme (f-BRS) algorithm. Then, a ray-casting algorithm is applied to back-project the 2D image pixel coordinates of the damage region to their 3D world coordinates for damage area quantification in real-world (physical) units. Finally, the area information is overlaid and anchored to the scene containing damage for visualization and documentation. The performance of XRIV is experimentally demonstrated by measuring surface structural damage of an in-service concrete bridge with less than 10% errors for two different test cases, and image processing latency of 2–3 s (or 0.5 s per seed point) from f-BRS. The proposed XRIV pipeline underscores the advantages of real-time interaction between expert users and the XR device through immersive visualization so that a human–machine collaborative workflow can be established to obtain better inspection outcomes in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

Despite the importance of the firefighter's SA, there have been limited research efforts to understand what cues and information firefighters use to assess ongoing situations and predict future conditions. In addition to fire events, contemporary firefighters respond to an increasing volume of non-fire incidents. Thus, this study aims to identify firefighters' SA during three fire incidents (single house fire, vehicle fire, and passenger aircraft fire) and three non-fire incidents (medical emergency, hazardous materials, and urban search and rescue). A goal-directed task analysis was conducted via focus group discussions with eight career firefighters. Findings indicate that firefighters build their SA by processing various cues from hazards (e.g., fire, ignition source), humans (e.g., occupants, bystanders, drivers, passengers), spatial elements (e.g., building structure, location of hazards), and surrounding conditions (e.g., traffic, weather). Our findings provide insights into SA measurement, SA-oriented work processes, training for SA, and designing technologies to support firefighters' SA during all-hazard responses.}

While moving, the agents observe events and exchange the information collected with other agents encountered: to this end, they use messaging systems purposely adapted to use point-to-point network connections to allow local data exchange between agents even when global network connections are not available. As is common in Delay Tolerant Networks, exchanged messages are locally stored: when a global network is available, the agents can upload all the information collected by themselves and other agents they encountered to a Control Room or a database in the Cloud. Differently from traditional DTN algorithms such as Epidemic and Spray&Wait, we propose a solution that keeps track of agents that shared information along the path and assess the quality of the information collected by multiple agents through a reputation-based mechanism that is safer than majority voting. A simulator compatible with OpenStreetMap is presented, as well as simulated experiments in two Italian towns to validate the feasibility of the approach.}

Existing methods for ‘flagging’ materials largely rely upon prior knowledge, whilst predictive methods are unreliable, particularly when compared with equivalent tools used for detecting ‘lawful’ pornography. In this paper we detail the design and implementation of a deep-learning based CEM classifier, leveraging existing pornography detection methods to overcome infrastructure and corpora limitations in this field. Specifically, we further existing research through direct access to numerous contemporary, real-world, annotated cases taken from Australian Federal Police holdings, demonstrating the dangers of overfitting due to the influence of individual users' proclivities. We quantify the performance of skin tone analysis in CEM cases, showing it to be of limited use. We assess the performance of our classifier and show it to be sufficient for use in forensic triage and ‘early warning’ of CEM, but of limited efficacy for categorising against existing scales for measuring child abuse severity. We identify limitations currently faced by researchers and practitioners in this field, whose restricted access to training material is exacerbated by inconsistent and unsuitable annotation schemas. Whilst adequate for their intended use, we show existing schemas to be unsuitable for training machine learning (ML) models, and introduce a new, flexible, objective, and tested annotation schema specifically designed for cross-jurisdictional collaborative use. This work, combined with a world-first ‘illicit data airlock’ project currently under construction, has the potential to bring a ‘ground truth’ dataset and processing facilities to researchers worldwide without compromising quality, safety, ethics and legality.}

The aforementioned summary framework, which provides a complete overview of the contribution of Industry 4.0 to the wood sector, is used for the development of promising future research opportunities, deriving mainly from the investigation of underexploited Industry 4.0 technologies (i.e., blockchain, augmented reality, autonomous and collaborative robots).

Weiser and his group at Xerox PARC in 1988, is still in its early infancy and far from leaving the laboratory stage. Nevertheless there are foreseeable applications in specific areas like automotive automation, health care, home automation, advanced manufacturing. Some aspects of Ubiquitous Computing from an automatic control perspective and its relation to mixed reality, augmented reality and pervasive computing will be covered. Several problems like geometric representation, extensible computing, scalability, movable interactions, integration of various network-technologies, user interface design for multi-modality, design methodologies and evaluation techniques, security/privacy issues and enabling software concepts are touched and it will be speculated about how Ubiquitous Computing might influence Low Cost Advanced Manufacturing and how experiences from the automation and control field might influence the emerging community.}

Accurate on-site locating and mapping of pipes and their conditions has been a great challenge for construction, maintenance and emergency response in a dynamic manner. Existing approaches, mostly based on design-centric and static visualization, are unsuitable for implementation within the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase because they are performed in a completely virtual environment and are unable to interact with buried assets on site. An integrated hyperrealistic visualization framework based on mobile augmented reality (MAR) is developed to support various real-life project tasks for O&M support of urban underground pipe networks. The proposed approach consists of three parts: a cloud-based data management platform, a 3D visualization development platform, and a location-based registration method for MAR. A cloud–edge–mobile layer is proposed to manage, analyze, process and visualize multisource data, especially for dynamic data. Field experiments on a real-life urban gas pipe network were carried out to investigate the feasibility of the proposed framework to achieve informed O&M support. The results demonstrate that (1) a smartphone linked to a Lite RTK device allows for both accurate locating and easy operation; (2) both the 3D virtual digital model and the multisource data visually superimpose onto the realistic environment, enabling on-site human–machine interaction in a hyperrealistic manner; and (3) MAR-based immersive visualization contributes to avoiding excavation damage, improving O&M efficiency and assisting emergency responders to make timely and better–informed decisions based on multisource information fusion.}

As such, the general public writ-large has had to wrestle with the colonization of publicly funded space, and the outcomes to each of our personal lives as a result of the massive harvesting and storing of our data, and the potential machine learning and processing applied to that data. Facebook, once content to harvest our data through its website, cookies, and apps on mobile phones and computers, has now planned to follow us more deeply into the Commons by developing new mapping technology combined with smart camera equipped Augmented Reality (AR) eyeglasses, that will track, render and record the Commons—and us with it. The resulting data will privately benefit Facebook's continued goal to expand its worldwide reach and growth. In this paper, we examine the ethical implications of Facebook's Project Aria research pilot through the perspectives of Responsible Innovation, comparing both existing understandings of Responsible Research and Innovation and Facebook's own Responsible Innovation Principles; we contextualise Project Aria within the Commons through applying current social multi-dimensional communications theory to understand the extensive socio-technological implications of Project Aria within society and culture; and we address the potentially serious consequences of the Facebook Project Aria experiment, inspiring countless other companies to shift their focus to compete with Project Aria, or beat it to the consumer marketplace.}

The lack of predictive safety systems that notify workers of upcoming dangers in advance is a major reason to blame in the highway maintenance and operation community. This article presents an integrative design framework for bringing recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the safety of highway workers through real-time multimodal notifications on-spot. To this end, this article conceptualizes and co-designs three major pillars: (1) AR user interface design for multimodal notification, (2) real-time AI at the edge for vehicle detection/classification from distance, and (3) real-time wireless communication in work zone setting to enable latency-aware operation between AI and AR components. Our early results demonstrate that we can achieve 24.83 FPS end-to-end execution latency on the Xavier AGX Jetson board with 48.7% mAP on BDD100K dataset, and a real-time communication covering 120 meters with an average latency of 5.1 ms at the farthest distance. Our mixed-method user research also reveals an acceptable level of excitement and engagement from the body of highway workers toward both the proposed technology and the designed user interface. Overall, this article provides a proof-of-concept toward AI-enabled AR safety systems in highway work zones.}

abstract = {Attributed to the advances in sensing and visualization technologies, novel wayfinding assistive systems are becoming more accessible such as the augmented reality (AR)-based wayfinding guidance that provides immersive information about the space and environments. However, the excessive information provided by these new methods results in cognitive overload, leading to subpar performance. Especially for emergency wayfinding where responders need to process a large amount of information while performing search and hazard identification tasks, an overdesigned wayfinding user interface and excessive information can cause confusion or disorientation among responders. This study proposes and tests a real-time cognition-driven navigation assistive system for emergency wayfinding called CogDNA. CogDNA measures responders’ real-time cognitive load and mental status based on the high-frequent pupillometer and gazes tracking data. Then the elements and formats of the primary wayfinding information are adjusted based on the individualized cognitive load models and the mental fatigue status measured by the pupillometer data including gaze movement entropy and blink rate. To test the efficacy of CogDNA, a human-subject experiment (n = 31) was performed with local firefighters in a simulated emergency wayfinding task. Three conditions were presented including the control condition with a static wayfinding system, a self-adaption condition where responders could adjust information with gesture controls, and the auto-adaption condition that tailored information based on real-time cognitive load and mental status measures. The result shows that the proposed method reduces the workload and improves the performance of the responders during the wayfinding task. The self-reported assessments also indicate benefits of the proposed method in cognitive load. The findings prove the efficacy of adaptive wayfinding information systems based on real-time cognitive load measures for future emergency wayfinding tasks.}

abstract = {Sensory science has advanced significantly in the past decade and is quickly evolving to become a key tool for predicting food product success in the marketplace. Increasingly, sensory data techniques are moving towards more dynamic aspects of sensory perception, taking account of the various stages of user-product interactions. Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.
Industrial relevance
The need for sensory evaluation within the food industry is becoming increasingly complex as companies continuously compete for consumer product acceptance in today's highly innovative and global food environment. Recent technological developments in virtual and augmented reality offer the food industry new opportunities for generating more reliable insights into consumer sensory perceptions of food and beverages, contributing to the design and development of new products with optimised consumer benefits. These technologies also hold significant potential for improving the predictive validity of newly launched products within the marketplace.}

abstract = {Background
The purpose of the present research was to develop an augmented reality paediatric first aid training system to investigate the effects of such a system on the knowledge, skill levels, and self-confidence of nursing students in first-aid practices.
Objective
This controlled experiment was conducted at a junior college. Ninety-five fourth-year nursing students participated in this study; 46 in the experimental group and 49 in the control group.
Design and methods
Data were collected using the Paediatric First Aid Knowledge Scale, Visual Analogue Scale of Self-Confidence and First Aid Practice Evaluation Checklist and pre- and post-test analyses were performed. The experimental group used the augmented reality application for paediatric first aid training, while the control group used a traditional method.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference between the students' pre-test scores in both groups, indicating that the students had similar levels of knowledge of paediatric first aid before the intervention. The post-test of the paediatric first aid knowledge results showed that students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group (p < .05). A significant difference was found in the first aid skills between the groups (p < .001). Additionally, the students in the experimental group stated that the augmented reality application significantly improved their self-confidence in performing paediatric emergency care (p < .001).
Conclusions
The augmented reality application had a positive effect on the knowledge and skill levels of nursing students regarding first aid practices. This study suggests that augmented reality is a valuable teaching tool in many areas of nursing education.}

Moreover, recent results and industrial proofs of concept show that these technologies demonstrate critical advantages in the industry. Nevertheless, the authoring and editing process of virtual and augmented content remains time-consuming, especially in complex industrial scenarios. While the use of interactive virtual environments through virtual and augmented reality presents new possibilities for many domains, a wider adoption of VR/AR is possible only if the authoring process is simplified, allowing for more rapid development and configuration without the need for advanced IT skills. To meet this goal, this study presents a new framework: INTERVALES. First, framework architecture is proposed, along with its different modules; this study then shows that the framework can be updated by not only IT workers, but also other job experts. The UML data model is presented to format and simplify the authoring processes for both VR and AR. This model takes into account virtual and augmented environments, the possible interactions, and ease operations orchestration. Finally, this paper presents the implementation of an industrial use case composed of collaborative robotic (cobotic) and manual assembly workstations in VR and AR based on INTERVALES data.}

abstract = {Objective
To test six different methods of directing a user's attention in a peripheral head mounted display assisted visual search task.
Background
Each time a user needs to shift their attention between virtual information and their environment has a cost. The faster a user can process a guiding cue and the fewer times they need to return to it, the more efficient that cue will be at directing a user's attention. The most effective method, creating a visual effect at the location of the target, is not suitable for peripheral head mounted displays. This study tests alternative guiding cues better suited to these devices.
Method
Participants searched for a singleton target hidden among 299 distractors while directed with one of six device-delivered guiding cues. Search times were recorded.
Results
A static region map was the most efficient and most preferred cue. Static and dynamic directional cues were also effective in comparison to non-guided search. Cues designed to work solely within the participants’ peripheral vision were relatively ineffective
Conclusion
Guidance cues that direct a user's attention to targets within the real environment do not need to precisely lead to the target. It is instead more efficient to lead a user to the general vicinity of the target quickly and then have the user revert to their natural visual search behaviour.
Application
This finding is broadly useful when assisting visual search tasks with handheld or worn devices which do not cover the user's full field of view.
Précis
This study tested six different methods of guiding attention in a peripheral head-mounted display assisted visual search task. This study compared static, dynamic and peripheral-vision endogenous cues to targets and found a static simple map cue both fastest and most preferred by users.}

abstract = {The edge computing paradigm enhances the exploitability of cloud computing by providing, in principle, the means to overcome the limitations in terms of responsiveness, bandwidth needs, privacy and availability in critical applications. By moving some of the components of the system towards the physical location where results are timely needed, it is possible to support mission critical applications and back them up with the flexibility and the resource availability and scalability offered by the cloud, while keeping mission costs lower (and response efficiency higher) than classical approaches. The main challenge in merging cloud and edge components lies in their correct balance to allow for the best results at the lowest costs. This means that performance-oriented evaluation models are crucial in the design, deployment and execution phases of the system lifetime. In this paper we present a modeling approach for complex, critical-edge computing-based systems relying on the use of queuing networks, applied to a novel architecture aiming at supporting operations in case of medium or large-scale accidents that involve interoperability among responders during the emergency phase. The proposed architecture allows the coordination of fire brigade teams, equipped with sensors and augmented reality devices, to minimize mission problems and timely exploit local and external information, as well as supporting interoperations with other first responders. The results show that, even with a standard modeling approach, these systems are extremely interesting and show non-trivial behaviors. Security and dependability issues of the proposed architecture are discussed.}

These technologies may be able to overcome main drawbacks of traditional evacuation drills bringing down cost and reducing the disruptiveness of evacuation training. However, great inconsistencies in measuring performance of trainees and lack of reasoning in the design of training programmes impede conclusions that go beyond qualitative trends.

abstract = {Due to the frequent occurrence of multi-hazard disasters worldwide in recent years, effective multi-hazard scenario analysis is imperative for disaster rescue and emergency management. The response procedure for different single hazards were investigated and formulated before. However, the investigations of disaster scenario rarely systematically address the entire development and response process of multi-hazards, including the coupling mechanisms, evolution dynamics, scenario assessment and emergency response. To this end, this paper presents our methodology of multi-hazard disaster scenario that integrates experiment–simulation–field data, focusing on three dimensions consisting of multi-hazard coupling, structures and systems, and emergency management. The newly proposed scenario method mainly comprises three aspects: experiments and simulations, multi-hazard field investigation, scenario analysis and response. Specifically, in order to study the large-scale, high-intensity and multi-hazard coupling effects, we carried out reduced-scale experiments and field measurement experiments to develop experimental similarity theory and prototype simulations of multi-hazards. In addition, a variety of field rescue and survey equipment, such as robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) technologies were utilized to acquire real-time data of multi-hazard field. Furthermore, we also examine the mechanism and framework of multi-hazard scenarios to formulate the detailed procedures of management and response. They are incorporated with the experiments, simulations, field data and models to construct a new scenario platform. The proposed scenario method was applied in a case study of the coupled wind and snow multi-hazard to verify its effectiveness. The new method contributes to the disaster relief, decision-making and emergency management for multi-hazard disaster to improve the urban resilience.}

abstract = {Background
Through providing on-demand visual and auditory cues while walking,augmented reality (AR) can theoretically cue spatiotemporal gait adaptations in, populations such as those with Parkinson’s disease. However, given the novelty of the, technology, the type and extent of gait adaptations in response to such a cueing, system are unknown. Before such systems can be incorporated into rehabilitation, approaches, it is important to understand how people interact with the technology. Research questions: What are the effects of visual and auditory cues delivered, through AR on spatiotemporal walking patterns and variability in a healthy, young, population? Is there a relationship between system usability and gait variability?,
Methods
Twenty healthy, young participants walked in four different cueing conditions using an AR headset: No Cues (NC) (i.e., natural gait), Auditory (A), Visual (V), and Auditory + Visual (AV). Inertial measurement units recorded spatiotemporal gait data at 200 Hz, a System Usability Survey was administered afterward, and linear regression models were developed to examine whether gait variability is predictive of system usability.
Results
All cueing conditions exhibited a significantly slower cadence compared to, NC trials. Cadence variability was significantly higher for A trials compared to V and, NC. V trials exhibited significantly decreased stride lengths compared to NC. Increased, reported system usability was significantly correlated with decreased stance phase, time variability across A trials.
Significance
Our findings support that holographic spatial-visual and auditory cues, are promising to evoke spatiotemporal gait adaptations. Results also support the, notion that the type of system and cue delivery design may impact gait outcomes.,Before an AR cueing system can be applied to a specific population in future, interventions, a more holistic approach towards finding the relationship between this, technology and its users is needed.}

Besides, the recent advancements in the computer vision field offer many state-of-the-art image processing capabilities that can be utilized for real-time surveillance data processing. Deploying those processing powers at several fog computing layers can bring novel solutions for computer vision-based real-time security solutions. This paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for smart video surveillance that can process the real-time frames on two consecutive fog layers, one for action recognition and the other for criminal threat-based response generation. The proposed architecture consists of three major modules. The first module is responsible for capturing surveillance videos by deploying RaspberryPi cameras in a distributed network. The second module is responsible for action recognition using a deep learning-based model installed inside NVIDIA Jetson Nano-devices placed on two fog layers. Finally, the security response is generated and broadcast to the law-enforcement agency. To evaluate the proposed model, experiments on semantic segmentation-based scene object recognition were run. The experimental results came up with a suitable recognition model that can be deployed in the fog layers of our proposed framework.}

All of us have evolved to think and store memory in 3-dimensions i.e when we look at the information in a flat piece of paper or computer screen, our brain takes its own time to translate it back to a 2D visual and store it. This is how our education system is, it started with textbook material and recently educators have started encouraging the use of smart classes which again shows videos. As a result, there is no practical exposure that lags us a step behind. This is where a promising technology of the future called Augmented Reality holds for us. Learners will have a 360-degree view of the real-world entities, interacting with those entities by touching them which will eventually make them have better insight about the concepts. Hence our learning curve decreases increasing the brain's productivity. With the development of smartphones, Augmented Reality is applied to a broader range.

This includes team training for emergency services, e.g. in firefighting. To achieve effective virtual training, creating a high level of immersion is essential. In that respect, motion capture systems offer the possibility to create highly immersive multi-user training experiences including full-body avatars. This work presents a preliminary prototype that enables the extinguishing of a fire on a container ship as a VR training scenario. The prototype provides a full-body and multi-user VR experience, based on the synthesis of position data provided by the motion capture system and orientation data from the VR headsets. As a consequence, the prototype allows an initial evaluation of results. The results confirm the value of using VR to train procedures that are difficult to train in the real world. Furthermore, the results show that motion capture based VR technologies are particularly useful for firefighting training, in which participants can collaborate in otherwise difficult-to-access environments. However, the work also illustrates that increasing the immersion of such training remains a challenge.}

Most existing research in AR-based wayfinding has focused on the technological aspects of developing AR-based software or devices to realize navigation. No previous investigations have focused on understanding the impact of immersive augmented reality (IAR)–based systems on human wayfinding performance from the cognitive perspective. Aimed at investigating the influence of IAR-based systems on people’s cognitive map development and their subsequent wayfinding performance as well as the effect of using three-dimensional (3D) layout models in IAR environments in addition to superimposed guideposts, an experiment was carried out in a building with a complex floor plan. A total of 54 university students were evenly divided into three groups: a control group with no IAR assistance, a second group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes only superimposed guideposts, and a third group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes both guideposts and a 3D layout model. Each participant was asked to conduct a spatial exploration task in the environment, sketch a floor map based on their spatial cognition, and perform a wayfinding task to find eight specific locations in the building. An analysis of the participants’ performance and responses to a number of self-evaluation questionnaires collected in the experiment indicates that IAR technology can help people develop their cognitive maps more effectively and can substantially improve their wayfinding performance with a much lower workload. A second finding is that adding a 3D layout model can enhance the effect of an IAR-based navigation system in terms of cognitive map development. The findings from this research extend the existing knowledge about IAR-based navigation and further verify that AR technology has the potential to reduce human workload for cognitive tasks. The results also could support its more effective application in various scenarios that require assisted wayfinding and cognitive map training, such as emergency evacuation drills.}

Involving laypersons in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through mobile-phone technology is becoming widespread in numerous countries, and different solutions were developed. We performed a systematic review on the impact of alerting citizens as first responders and to provide an overview of different strategies and technologies used.
Methods
We searched electronic databases up to October 2019. Eligible studies described systems to alert citizens first responders to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest through text messages or apps. We analyzed the implementation and performance of these systems and their impact on patients’ outcomes.
Results
We included 28 manuscripts describing 12 different systems. The first text message system was implemented in 2006 and the first app in 2010. First responders accepted to intervene in median (interquartile) 28.7% (27–29%) of alerts and reached the scene after 4.6 (4.4–5.5) minutes for performing CPR. First responders arrived before ambulance, started CPR and attached a defibrillator in 47% (34–58%), 24% (23–27%) and 9% (6–14%) of cases, respectively. Pooled analysis showed that first responders activation increased layperson-CPR rates (1463/2292 [63.8%] in the intervention group vs. 1094/1989 [55.0%] in the control group; OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11–2.60; p = 0.01) and survival to hospital discharge or at 30 days (327/2273 [14.4%] vs. 184/1955 [9.4%]; OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.24–1.84; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Alerting citizens as first responders in case of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may reduce the intervention-free time and improve patients’ outcomes.}

However, threats are also prevalent, with crimes such as child sexual exploitation and privacy violations occurring in metaverses that mimic reality, making digital forensics for metaverse threats essential. Nevertheless, technical standards for different types of metaverses have yet to be defined, making investigation difficult. Furthermore, even though metaverses are complex forms that combine multiple hardware devices and software applications, existing studies have either focused on a single component or not analyzed the real-world environment. In this study, we derived a metaverse ecosystem with common components that comprise a metaverse and analyzed the hardware and software used throughout the user's metaverse lifecycle from a digital forensics perspective. In particular, we applied real-case-based scenario to the metaverse environment of the most popular Meta's currently in use to identify various artifacts that can be used across the ecosystem and validate the effectiveness of the process. We also developed a metaverse digital forensics tool for the first time in the current situation where open-source and commercial tools do not support metaverse investigations.}

Within the medical profession, simulation techniques have been used extensively by anesthesiologists for individual and teamwork training tasks. Following the example in anesthesiology, simulation curricula are being developed for teaching and evaluating core competencies for surgical and emergency medicine residents, prehospital personnel, and medical students. Simulation models can be as simple as static mannequins for procedural skills or as complex as high-fidelity human patient simulators that react physiologically to administered medications and provider actions. As this technology continues to mature, benefits of incorporating such safe and valuable education to trainees across all medical disciplines and training levels must be considered in light of the expense of such endeavors. Benefits of simulation training within the medical field include learning and perfecting procedural skills before patient interaction, participating in rare or complicated case scenarios which might otherwise not be encountered in traditional training, and nonprocedural training such as teamwork training and disaster management skills. As efforts continue to emerge to increase patient safety and reduce medical errors, simulation has become more popular in promoting patient autonomy while allowing trainees to experience positive and negative outcomes with the opportunity for constructive feedback, or debriefing, afterward.}

These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0. The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training.}

While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalized; no synergies have been explored. This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others. The main goal of this study is to holistically analyze the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration.

The goal of this research is to address challenges encountered in the current practice for structural engineers and first responders to inspect and disseminate building damage assessments and resource requests more efficiently to support US&R. The SUPER-MAN system is equipped with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, as the storage device of assessment information on the disaster site, and a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) with a Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) implementation for communication. SUPER-MAN strengthens responders’ situational awareness, reduces confusion of inconsistent assessment formats, and automates information dissemination and editing. As a result, lifesaving operations are adequately prioritized, risk of first responders are minimized, and requests of response resources are facilitated. Results obtained from field trials carried out at the Illinois Fire Service Institute with a simulated disaster scenario and computer simulations of the MANET are presented to highlight the benefits provided by SUPER-MAN.}

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of computing power and deep learning algorithms, pedestrian detection has made great progress. Nevertheless, once a detection model trained on generic datasets (such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO) is applied to a specific scene, its precision is limited by the distribution gap between the generic data and the specific scene data. It is difficult to train the model for a specific scene, due to the lack of labeled data from that scene. Even though we manage to get some labeled data from a specific scene, the changing environmental conditions make the pre-trained model perform bad. In light of these issues, we propose a parallel vision approach to scene-specific pedestrian detection. Given an object detection model, it is trained via two sequential stages: (1) the model is pre-trained on augmented-reality data, to address the lack of scene-specific training data; (2) the pre-trained model is incrementally optimized with newly synthesized data as the specific scene evolves over time. On publicly available datasets, our approach leads to higher precision than the models trained on generic data. To tackle the dynamically changing scene, we further evaluate our approach on the webcam data collected from Church Street Market Place, and the results are also encouraging.}

A set of 108 recent papers was analyzed based on key concepts like the phases and types of firefighter operations. In doing so, we identified ten frequently researched types of technologies as well as their respective characteristics. The in-depth analysis of the results revealed several literature gaps regarding non-firefighting missions, support beyond the reconnaissance phase, integration of information, and domain specifics. All in all, the study constitutes a comprehensive and unique overview of the domain as well as a solid foundation for future research.}

abstract = {Chemical images which are often computed from hyperspectral images contain the spatial distribution of chemical information of a scene. For many applications visualizing such images on computer screens is sufficient, however there are cases where there is a need to combine the chemical images more naturally with human vision. This is especially true for interactive work where chemical images are being rapidly updated to the user. Effective integration of spatial information in general from external sources with vision is a challenge. One approach is to overlay the view of the real physical world with computer-generated graphics as in augmented reality. However such cluttering of the visual field with computer-generated graphics may confuse the user and reduce functionality. Another is projecting the chemical images back onto the scene under study in order to render the chemical information in situ to the user. This approach, however has challenges in connection with very small and very large scenes under investigation. An alternative approach is here investigated based on the possibility of enhancing the human vision system using a sensory substitution device. Such devices enables a person to sense spatial information conveyed through sensory channels other than the eye, such as hearing and sense of touch. Results presented support the claim that spatial chemical information from a hyperspectral camera can be conveyed to the brain through a sensory channel different from the eyes. As this is tested on a sighted subject it effectively provides an extension of the human vision system to incorporate chemical information which otherwise is invisible to the naked eye.}

However, there is a paucity of comprehensive research examining their role across all stages of urban flood risk management. To address, this study conducts an integrated critical review to identify the application of CDVT and assess their contribution to the prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery stages of flood risk management. The results show that virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital twin technologies are the primary CDVT used in urban flood visualisation, with virtual reality being the most frequently used. The focus of urban flood visualisation studies has been primarily on preparation and mitigation stages. However, there is a need to investigate the application of these technologies in the entire urban water cycle. Furthermore, there is potential for greater adoption of digital twin, especially in simulating urban flood inundation and flood evacuation routes. Integrating real-time data, data-driven modeling, and CDVT can significantly improve real-time flood forecasting. This benefits stakeholders and the public by enhancing early warning systems, preparedness, and flood resilience, leading to more effective flood risk management and reduced impacts on communities.}

abstract = {Mobile augmented reality systems (MARS) have the potential to revolutionize the way in which information is provided to users. Virtual information can be directly integrated with the real world surrounding the mobile user, who can interact with it to display related information, to pose and resolve queries, and to collaborate with other users. However, we believe that the benefits of MARS will only be achieved if the user interface (UI) is actively managed so as to maximize the relevance and minimize the confusion of the virtual material relative to the real world. This article addresses some of the steps involved in this process, focusing on the design and layout of the mobile user's overlaid virtual environment. The augmented view of the user's surroundings presents an interface to context-dependent operations, many of which are related to the objects in view—the augmented world is the user interface. We present three UI design techniques that are intended to make this interface as obvious and clear to the user as possible: information filtering, UI component design, and view management. Information filtering helps select the most relevant information to present to the user. UI component design determines the format in which this information should be conveyed, based on the available display resources and tracking accuracy. For example, the absence of high accuracy position tracking would favor body- or screen-stabilized components over world-stabilized ones that would need to be exactly registered with the physical objects to which they refer. View management attempts to ensure that the virtual objects that are displayed visually are arranged appropriately with regard to their projections on the view plane. For example, the relationships among objects should be as unambiguous as possible, and physical or virtual objects should not obstruct the user's view of more important physical or virtual objects in the scene. We illustrate these interface design techniques using our prototype collaborative, cross-site MARS environment, which is composed of mobile and non-mobile augmented reality and virtual reality systems.}

abstract = {Communication support is a serious limitation for Latin American firefighters when they deal with emergency situations. The insufficient number of radio channels and the impossibility to deliver digital information force firemen to improvise during response processes, e.g., to make decisions using their experience and poor or null supporting information. These improvised actions affect the time required to take control of an emergency, and also affect the evolution of the crisis situation. Provided most of Latin American fire companies are volunteer organizations, communication solutions that could help to overcome these problems are usually expensive for them. This article presents a low-cost mobile collaborative application, which may be used in emergency situations to overcome most of the firefighters’ communication problems. The application, named MobileMap, is the result of the research and development work conducted by the authors, supported by a Chilean fire company, during the last three years. MobileMap allows ad hoc communication, decisions support and collaboration among firefighters in the field using mobile devices. This solution complements the radio communication systems. Since the interactions supported by MobileMap are recorded, it is possible to analyze such information after the crisis and learn for future emergencies. The tool was evaluated in simulated and real scenarios, and the obtained results are highly encouraging.}

Awareness of a user's context (such as user profile, role, preferences, task, and existing project conditions) can enhance the construction project delivery process by providing a mechanism to determine information relevant to a particular context. Context awareness can also be used to improve security, logistics and health and safety practices on construction sites. Location is an important aspect of context awareness. A location aware application can utilize the knowledge of the user/object location to provide relevant information and services. This paper argues that a successful and reliable location tracking system must be able to track a user's spatial context and deliver contextual data continuously in both outdoor and indoor environments to effectively support construction projects. Research describing the use of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) for indoor tracking and Global Positioning System (GPS) for outdoor spatial context tracking is presented, and an integrated tracking technique using WLAN and GPS for ubiquitous location sensing is introduced. The key benefits and technical challenges of such an integrated approach are also highlighted. The presented tracking techniques have been validated in both indoor and outdoor environments to ensure their practical implementation on real construction jobsites.}

This paper presents analysis of the results of a survey on aspects of personal safety apps and how individuals perceive them in relation to their personal safety, privacy and their preference to purchase them. It explores their willingness to download for free or purchase such an app, their impression of features that an app might include such as revealing their location, how they would rate police force monitoring if included as a feature of the app and finally how they would rate a personal safety app against other technologies used to improve perceived transport user safety. The results show that the majority of respondents would consider downloading a personal safety app. Lower levels of engagement with technology, a higher level of education, being resident in the city of Dublin (as opposed to surrounding regions) and privacy concerns tended to make females less likely to consider downloading the app. These findings were not repeated for males. The results suggest that younger respondents were more likely to be negatively impacted by the inclusion of a facility to report location in an emergency on the app, while the older age groups were more likely to be unaffected. For the location tracking feature, cluster membership, gender and resident outside Dublin were significant. Less than half of the respondents would be negatively influenced in their decision to buy the app if a cost of €1.79 were introduced. When respondents were asked about the inclusion of police monitoring as a feature of the app, the results suggested that police monitoring had a more definite effect on perceived personal safety than on privacy.}

These layers enable in-situ visualization of useful data to aid public, scientists, officials, and decision-makers in acquiring a bird's eye view of the current, historical, or forecasted condition of a community. The framework incorporates multiuser support to allow different stakeholders to remotely work on the same VR environment and observe other users' actions and 3D positions via avatars in real-time, and thus, presenting the potential to be utilized as a virtual incident command center or a meeting room. GeospatialVR's purpose is to enhance existing web-based cyberinfrastructure systems with the integration of immersive geospatial capabilities to assist the development of next-generation information and decision support systems powered by virtual reality.

Seamless sharing of information among users using Social networking provides for a unique type of sensor. This human-as-a sensor is already deployed in the field and only requires harvesting of the information to glean ground truth. Further, the proliferation of the smartphones and their connectivity networks has powered the ordinary individuals to share and acquire information regarding the events happening in his/her immediate vicinity in a real-time fashion. The information provided by these sensors is already annotated with descriptions such as “urgency” “critically wounded” which normally would not be found in traditional machine based sensors. Further, when appropriately employed this real-time data can support in detecting localized events like fire, accidents, shooting, etc…, as they unfold and pin-point individuals being affected by those events. The spatio-temporal information can be indexed, grouped and deployed on Smartphones and other devices that first responders can use in the field to augment decision making. In this vein, under SATE and YATE programs, the research team at AFRL TecˆEdge Discovery labs had demonstrated the feasibility of developing Smartphone applications, that can provide a augmented reality view of the appropriate detected events in a given geographical location (localized) and also provide an event search capability over a large geographic extent. In its current state, the application thru its backend connectivity utilizes a data (Text & Image) processing framework, which deals with data challenges like; identifying and aggregating important events, analyzing and correlating the events temporally and spatially and building a search enabled event database.

abstract = {Automated driving research over the past decades has mostly focused on highway environments. Recent technological developments have drawn researchers and manufacturers to look ahead at introducing automated driving in cities. The current position paper examines this challenge from the viewpoint of scientific experts. Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.}

Basic life support education for schoolchildren has become a key initiative to increase bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rates. Our objective was to review the existing literature on teaching schoolchildren basic life support to identify the best practices to provide basic life support training in schoolchildren.
METHODS
After topics and subgroups were defined, a comprehensive literature search was conducted. Systematic reviews and controlled and uncontrolled prospective and retrospective studies containing data on students <20 years of age were included.
RESULTS
Schoolchildren are highly motivated to learn basic life support. The CHECK-CALL-COMPRESS algorithm is recommended for all schoolchildren. Regular training in basic life support regardless of age consolidates long-term skills. Young children from 4 years of age are able to assess the first links in the chain of survival. By 10 to 12 years of age, effective chest compression depths and ventilation volumes can be achieved on training manikins. A combination of theoretical and practical training is recommended. Schoolteachers serve as effective basic life support instructors. Schoolchildren also serve as multipliers by passing on basic life support skills to others. The use of age-appropriate social media tools for teaching is a promising approach for schoolchildren of all ages.
CONCLUSIONS
Schoolchildren basic life support training has the potential to educate whole generations to respond to cardiac arrest and to increase survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Comprehensive legislation, curricula, and scientific assessment are crucial to further develop the education of schoolchildren in basic life support.}

Previous research has generated knowledge about controversies in digital platform innovations. However, this work mainly focuses on the types of controversies and their effects rather than on the process of controversy emergence. In this article, we analyze how controversies related to digital platform innovation emerge and how they unfold over the innovation process. We analyze the case of the Google Glass failure to establish this ARSG (Augmented Reality Smart Glasses) extension to Google's digital platform. The paper contributes to the study of controversies by analyzing the digital platform innovation process as a process of translation, in which there are possible controversy emergence points originated in types of disagreements among the different human actors involved and their interactions with non-human elements. These disagreements are related to specific features of digital platforms: the digital platform generativity, the multisided market arrangements in the platform; the loosely coupled layers of technologies and applications involved, and the opaqueness that results from these arrangements. The framework proposed can support digital platform scholars and practitioners to in better understand and manage controversies.}

During this phase, system designers need to accurately elicit, model and validate the desired system based on user requirements. Smart driver assistive technologies (SDAT) belong to a class of complex systems that are used to alleviate accident risk by improving situation awareness, reducing driver workload or enhancing driver attentiveness. Such systems aim to draw drivers’ attention on critical information cues that improve decision making. Discovering the requirements for such systems necessitates a holistic approach that addresses not only functional and non-functional aspects but also the human requirements such as drivers’ situation awareness and workload. This work describes a simulation-based user requirements discovery method. It utilizes the benefits of a modular virtual reality simulator to model driving conditions to discover user needs that subsequently inform the design of prototype SDATs that exploit the augmented reality method. Herein, we illustrate the development of the simulator, the elicitation of user needs through an experiment and the prototype SDAT designs using UNITY game engine.}

Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept. Guidelines for MCT design were validated with an online survey completed by 81 police officers. Future research directions were proposed to recognize police officer needs and work context.}

Efforts have been made to integrate these systems to vehicles mostly for security purposes and user authentication. Until now, most of the systems do not go beyond using facial and fingerprint data to start the engine or access the car; however, new generations demand more personalization plus the vehicle making decisions based on their physiological characteristics. Although this kind of technology is considered a luxury feature in general, actually it could help users and save their lives. Indeed, biometry is the way to make the human-vehicle relationship happen, whether the biometric devices are embedded inside the vehicle, used as an accessory or wearables. By using as input not only the sensors inside the vehicle but also data from outside, the vehicle could adapt and/or learn new information to make the best possible decision.}

During building fire emergency response operations, establishment and utilization of situational awareness are of essential importance, enabling first responders, especially incident commanders, to better assess changing on-scene situations and make informed decisions. The paper uses an interactive card game to guide first responders to establish situational awareness about an imaginary building fire emergency, and examines the information items needed by first responders in this process. An evaluation of the importance of each information item is performed. The results show that location and status of occupants and first responders, and status and development of fire and smoke are the foremost important information items. Information items in the “at emergency scene” category were updated on average five times more frequently than information items in other categories. In order to investigate sources for obtaining the above information, and examine requirements for better implementing situational awareness at emergency scenes, a nationwide survey was conducted with first responders in the United States. The results point out a discrepancy between current and desired information sources for establishing situational awareness at building fire emergency scenes. The paper also reports detailed implementation requirements, including type of assistance, level of details and format of representation for establishing situational awareness, and illustrates statistical impacts of location, years of experience and job title on the requirements.}

They are essential for dealing with increasingly complex systems in unstructured, dynamic environments. The purpose of this article is to review the role of laser technology in enabling better, more precise interactions and their control, and to identify opportunities and challenges in this area. While the most common applications of laser technology are found in medical and health care, manufacturing, and communication, other domains such as safety, quality assurance, agriculture, construction, entertainment, defense, transportation, and law enforcement also benefit from it. In spite of the rapid dissemination of this technology, its role in support of collaboration and discovery is still in its infancy. Research activities concerning new ways of using lasers as a collaboration supporting technology that may strengthen new areas have been relatively limited. Nevertheless, the translation to this domain of collaboration support has been recognized as vital for activities that demand increasingly more coordinated effort among interacting agents (e.g., humans, machines, particles) and digital, possibly also photonic agents. Recent advances in laser technology in a number of application domains are reviewed in this article, focusing primarily on lasers’ role for supporting different forms of precision interactions and collaboration. In addition, a framework with five collaboration support functions and five collaboration dimensions is defined for this review. The taxonomy framework is useful for enabling better understanding of the existing and emerging opportunities that laser-based technology offers for collaboration support, its advantages and several research gaps.}

The education sector has benefited from this ICT-driven revolution, which has provided and expanded multiple new tools and teaching methods that did not exist just a few decades ago. In light of this technological change, virtual laboratories (VLs) based on the use of virtual reality (VR) have emerged, which are increasingly used to facilitate the teaching–learning process in a wide range of training activities, both academic and professional types. The set of advantages offered by this type of VL, the main of which are listed in this article, has made its use increasingly common as support for engineering classes at universities. This paper presents a study involving 420 engineering students from Spanish and Portuguese universities and associated analyses on the assessment of different parameters in various VLs designed by the authors. The results obtained indicate that, in general, VR-based VLs are widely accepted and demanded by students, who likewise consider real laboratories (RLs) necessary in face-to-face teaching. In the current post-COVID-19 educational scenario, VLs and RLs will coexist within the new hybrid models that combine face-to-face and online teaching and learning.}

Specifically, we call for more research on (a) the challenges and critical success factors of Industry 4.0 technologies; (b) hitherto underexplored core technologies of the Industry 4.0; (c) the interaction of multiple core technologies (are they complements or substitutes?); as well as for (d) further consolidation and interdisciplinary dissemination efforts.}

By focusing on practices rather than understanding individual behaviour the research reveals meanings associated with technology practices by young adults at airports, an alignment by young adults with process technologies and gaps with discretionary technologies at airports.

abstract = {City administrators hoping to achieve people-centric smart city (SC) development require a clear understanding of citizens’ preferences and perceptions about SC services. This study fills that need by presenting evidence-based research on such preferences and perceptions from the perspective of need theories, taking Taiwan as a case study. Specifically, we investigated Taiwanese citizens’ preferences for 35 SC services of seven dimensions classified in two domains, as well as their three perceptions of the usefulness of these SC services in the realization of human needs. The results show that most of our respondents clearly perceived SC services as both important and useful to their existence, relatedness, and growth needs, and that they expressed relatively higher preferences for such services to operate in the “hard” domain – e.g., smart energy, smart transport, or smart safety –than the “soft” one, e.g., smart living. Based on these findings, this study provides policy recommendations that, if implemented, could be expected to advance SC development by increasing citizens’ usage of SC services in both the hard and soft domains, and serve the wider aim of improving their well-being and quality of life.}

abstract = {Conventional CAD modelling software demands substantial utilisation of input modalities like the keyboard and mouse for creating 3-dimensional (3D) models. The dexterity measures involved in controlling input modalities could pose challenges to users with motor disabilities—including the inability to move their limbs, particularly their upper and lower arms, and fingers, due to traumatic damage or congenital problems. In order to meet these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual reality (VR)-based medium to help users with motor disabilities build simple 3D models for architectural design. The concept of operating buttons using head-gaze in the VR environment has been utilised to perform scaling—a 3D object manipulation method—to create simplified building models. Moreover, navigation in the VR space using tilting of the head has been employed with the user seated on a revolving chair, thus eliminating the need for any limbic movement. Unity game engine was used to develop two variations of the VR model with a different button layout for creating simple cuboidal volumes mimicking buildings in the virtual environment. Both variations have been tested with 32 individuals against a specific performance indicator (i.e., task completion time) and self-reported metrics, such as the perception of effort applied and degree of visual clutter, followed by retrospective participant feedback sessions. One of the VR application's variants (i.e., variant 1) produced promising results regarding overall usability and effort demand. This paper also proposes a methodological framework for an AI-based, intelligent, and adaptive VR application interface that caters to the user's abilities and pain points in real-time. In the future, this framework could be instrumental in creating a comprehensive gaze-based VR tool for 3D modelling having multiple functions to help users with motor disabilities.}

abstract = {The deployment of pervasive information and communication technologies (ICTs) within smart city initiatives transforms cities into extraordinary apparatuses of data capture. ICTs such as smart cameras, sound sensors and lighting technology are trying to infer and affect persons’ interests, preferences, emotional states, and behaviour. It should be no surprise then that contemporary legal and policy debates on privacy in smart cities are dominated by a debate focused on data and, therefore, on data protection law. In other words, data protection law is the go-to legal framework to regulate data processing activities within smart cities and similar initiatives. While this may seem obvious, a number of important hurdles might prevent data protection law to be (successfully) applied to such initiatives. In this contribution, we examine one such hurdle: whether the data processed in the context of smart cities actually qualifies as personal data, thus falling within the scope of data protection law. This question is explored not only through a theoretical discussion but also by taking an illustrative example of a smart city-type initiative – the Stratumseind 2.0 project and its living lab in the Netherlands (the Stratumseind Living Lab; SLL). Our analysis shows that the requirement of ‘identifiability’ might be difficult to satisfy in the SLL and similar initiatives. This is so for two main reasons. First, a large amount of the data at stake do not qualify as personal data, at least at first blush. Most of it relates to the environment, such as, data about the weather, air quality, sound and crowding levels, rather than to identified or even likely identifiable individuals. This is connected to the second reason, according to which, the aim of many smart city initiatives (including the SLL) is not to identify and target specific individuals but to manage or nudge them as a multiplicity – a combination of the environment, persons and all of their interactions. This is done by trying to affect the ‘atmosphere’ on the street. We thus argue that a novel type of profiling operations is at stake; rather than relying on individual or group profiling, the SLL and similar initiatives rely upon what we have called ‘atmospheric profiling’. We conclude that it remains highly uncertain, whether smart city initiatives like the SLL actually process personal data. Yet, they still pose risks for a wide variety of rights and freedoms, which data protection law is meant to protect, and a need for regulation remains.}

In a digitalized context, a cloud manufacturing platform for occupational health assessment, capable of collecting physiological, environmental and manufacturing process data can potentially enable prompt action to prevent fatalities. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based framework and associated methods to classify physiological data acquired using wearable sensors during manufacturing work, to be utilized in a fuzzy-based expert system to determine the level and type of health risk for Operator 4.0.

A focus on early hemorrhage control with aggressive use of tourniquets and hemostatic gauze is now generally accepted. This narrative literature review aims to discuss external hemorrhage control and the applicability of military concepts in space exploration. In space, environmental hazards, spacesuit removal, and limited crew training could cause significant time delays in providing initial trauma care. Cardiovascular and hematological adaptations to the microgravity environment are likely to reduce the ability to compensate, and resources for advanced resuscitation are limited. Any unscheduled emergency evacuation requires a patient to don a spacesuit, involves exposure to high G-forces upon re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, and costs a significant amount of time until a definitive care facility is reached. As a result, early hemorrhage control in space is critical. Safe implementation of hemostatic dressings and tourniquets seems feasible, but adequate training will be essential, and tourniquets are preferably converted to other methods of hemostasis in case of a prolonged medical evacuation. Other emerging approaches such as early tranexamic acid administration and more advanced techniques have shown promising results as well. For future exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, when evacuation is not possible, we look into what training or assistance tools would be helpful in managing the bleed at the point of injury.}

abstract = {Objectives
To analyse the 2020 international and European recommendations for Paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), highlighting the most important changes and propose lines of development in Spain.
Methods
Critical analysis of the paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation recommendations of the European Resuscitation Council.
Results
The most relevant changes in the CPR recommendations for 2020 are in basic CPR the possibility of activating the emergency system after performing the five rescue ventilations with the mobile phone on loudspeaker, and in advanced CPR, bag ventilation between two rescuers if possible, the administration of epinephrine as soon as a vascular access is obtained, the increase in the respiratory rate in intubated children between 10 and 25 bpm according to their age and the importance of controlling the quality and coordination of CPR. In CPR training, the importance of training non-technical skills such as teamwork, leadership and communication and frequent training to reinforce and maintain competencies is highlighted.
Conclusions
It is essential that training in Paediatric CPR in Spain follows the same recommendations and is carried out with a common methodology, adapted to the characteristics of health care and the needs of the students. The Spanish Paediatric and Neonatal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Group should coordinate this process, but the active participation of all paediatricians and health professionals who care for children is also essential.
Resumen

This study presents a review about human-human interactions (i.e., interactions among people or groups of people and their influence on behavior during emergencies), human-building interactions (i.e., how buildings influence human behavior and how human behavior impacts the building performance during emergencies), human-emergency interactions (i.e., how emergency situations impact human behavior and people’s coping strategies with emergencies), and second-order interactions among humans, buildings, and emergencies. The review reveals that while various human-human interactions among building occupants have been investigated, some of them (e.g., grouping behavior, information sharing) are less understood, and the interactions between building occupants and staff members need further explorations. With regard to human-building interactions, prior studies have been limited to certain types of buildings and building attributes, while the aggregate impact of a combination of building attributes should be more studied. Moreover, building fires were the most frequently examined emergency type, while other types of emergencies, such as earthquakes and acts of extreme violence, received less attention. Additionally, second-order interactions among humans, buildings and emergencies have not been widely studied. This paper also puts forward recommendations for future research, including validating prior findings when transforming them into real-world applications, leveraging the strength of different data collection and interpretation methods, as well as collaborating more closely with researchers and practitioners in related areas.}

While adopted for their convenience outside of the healthcare sector, these invasive, semi-permanent implantable devices create augmented bodies that can be subject to ubiquitous surveillance. Situating human microchip implantations within surveillance literature, we draw from neoliberal perspectives of surveillance to examine augmented bodies, particularly as sources for market activity and as subjects of social control and sorting when these bodies are used as access control mechanisms, payment methods, and tracking means in employment, residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. History has demonstrated time and time again how unfettered technology applications and uses have led to real and/or perceived misuse by private and public sectors. Through the lens of function creep, we identify a pattern of expansion of applications and uses of technology beyond those originally intended across new technologies, such as DNA genetic genealogy databases, IoT wearables, and COVID-19 contact tracing apps, and provide illustrative examples of function creep, particularly the use of these technologies in criminal investigations and prosecutions despite not being intended or marketed for such use. By demonstrating the lack of clearly defined boundaries in the applications and uses of various new technologies and their associated data, and the ways they were misused, we demonstrate how human microchip implantations are headed on a similar path. The current and potential future uses of this technology raise concerns about the absence of regulation, law, and policy barring or limiting its application and use in specific sectors, and the impact of this technology on users’ security, data protection, and privacy. Undeniably, the present and potential future functions, applications, uses, and extensions of human microchip implantations in various sectors warrant a proactive examination of their security, privacy, and data protection consequences and the implementation of proactive policies to regulate new and currently unregulated uses of this technology and its associated data within these sectors.}

Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.}

The aim of this study is to investigate enabling technologies of Industry 4.0, focusing on technologies that have a greater impact on safety management. Main characteristics of such technologies will be identified and described according to their use in an industrial environment. In order to do this, we chose a systematic literature review (SLR) to answer the research question in a comprehensively way. Results show that articles can be grouped according to different criteria. Moreover, we found that Industry 4.0 can increase safety levels in warehouse and logistic, as well as several solutions are available for building sector.}

Computational models of physical phenomena are developed, and then deployed and computed on High Performance Computing resources to infer incident conditions by assimilating live sensor data from an emergency in real time—or, in the case of predictive models, faster-than-real time. The results of these models are then interpreted by a knowledge-based reasoning scheme to provide decision support information in appropriate terms for the emergency responder. These models are accessed over a Grid from an agent-based system, of which the human responders form an integral part.

abstract = {Objectives
The main objective of the study is to determine the efficiency in the execution of the START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) triage, comparing Virtual Reality (VR) to Clinical Simulation (CS) in a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI). The secondary objective is to determine the stress produced in the health professionals in the two situations described.
Materials
A comparative study on the efficiency and the stress during triage in a MSI was conducted. The basal and post levels of salivary α-amylase (sAA) activity were measured in all the participants before and after the simulation.
Results
The percentage of victims that were triaged correctly was 87.65% (SD = 8.3); 88.3% (SD = 9.65) for the Clinical Simulation with Actors (CSA) group and 87.2% (SD = 7.2) for the Virtual Reality Simulation (VRG) group, without any significant differences (p = 0.612) between both groups. The basal sAA was 103.26 (SD = 79.13) U/L with a significant increase (p < 0.001) with respect to the post-simulation levels (182.22, SD = 148.65 U/L). The increase of sAA was 80.70 (SD = 109.67) U/mL, being greater for the CSA group than the VRG group.
Conclusion
The results show that virtual reality method is as efficient as clinical simulation for training on the execution of basic triage (START model). Also, based on the sAA results, we can attest that clinical simulation creates a more stressful training experience for the student, so that is should not be substituted by the use of virtual reality, although the latter could be used as a complementary activity.}

abstract = {Background
Using a mobile virtual reality (VR) platform to heighten realism for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training has the potential to improve bystander response.
Objectives
We examined whether using a VR mobile application (mApp) for CPR training would improve bystander response compared with a standard mApp CPR training.
Methods
We randomized lay bystanders to either our intervention arm (VR mApp) or our control arm (mApp). During a post-intervention skills test, we collected bystander response data (call 911, perform CPR, ask for an automated external defibrillator (AED)), along with CPR quality (chest compression (CC) rate and depth). Wilcox rank sum was used to analyze CC rate and CC depth as they were not normally distributed; Pearson’s Chi-square was used to analyze Chain of Survival variables.
Results
Between 3/2018 and 9/2018, 105 subjects were enrolled: 52 VR mApp and 53 mApp. Mean age was 46 ± 16 years, 34% were female, 59% were Black, and 17% were currently CPR trained (≤2 years). Bystander response was significantly higher in the VR mApp arm: called 911 (82% vs 58%, p = 0.007) and asked for an AED (57% vs 28%, p = 0.003). However there was no difference in CPR performed (98% vs 98%, p = NS) and the application of the AED (90% vs 93%, p = NS). When comparing the VR mApp to the mApp, mean CC rate was 104 ± 42 cpm vs 112 ± 30 cpm (p = NS), and mean CC depth was 38 ± 15 mm vs 44 ± 13 mm (p = 0.05).
Conclusion
The use of the VR mApp significantly increased the likelihood of calling 911 and asking for an AED, however, CC depth was decreased.}

s This work emphasizes the current research status of the urban Digital Twins to establish an intelligent spatiotemporal framework. A Geospatial Artificial Intelligent (GeoAI) system is developed based on the Geographic Information System and Artificial Intelligence. It integrates multi-video technology and Virtual City in urban Digital Twins.
Methods
Besides, an improved small object detection model is proposed: YOLOv5-Pyramid, and Siamese network video tracking models, namely MPSiam and FSSiamese, are established. Finally, an experimental platform is built to verify the georeferencing correction scheme of video images.
Result
The Multiply-Accumulate value of MPSiam is 0.5B, and that of ResNet50-Siam is 4.5B. Besides, the model is compressed by 4.8 times. The inference speed has increased by 3.3 times, reaching 83 Frames Per Second. 3% of the Average Expectation Overlap is lost. Therefore, the urban Digital Twins-oriented GeoAI framework established here has excellent performance for video georeferencing and target detection problems.}

abstract = {Background
Worldwide, bystander CPR rates are low; one effective way to increase these rates is to train schoolchildren; however, the most effective way to train them is currently unknown.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, evaluated whether CPR training for schoolchildren, using innovative teaching modalities (nonpractical, self, or peer-training) versus standard instructor-led training, resulted in higher quality CPR, self-confidence and short-term (≤3 months post-training) or long-term (>3 months post-training) retention of CPR skills.
Results
From 9793 citations, 96 studies published between 1975 and 2022 (44 RCTs and 52 before/after studies) were included. There were 43,754 students, average age of 11.5 ± 0.9 (range 5.9–17.6) and 49.2% male. Only 13 RCTs compared practical vs. nonpractical training (n = 5), self- vs. instructor-led training (n = 7) or peer- vs. instructor-led training (n = 5). The observed statistically significant differences in mean depth and rate of compressions between children with hands-on practical training and those without were not clinically relevant. Regardless of training modality, compression depth was consistently suboptimal. No differences were observed in CPR skills immediately or ≤ 3 months post-training, between children who were self- or peer-trained vs. instructor-led. Due to lack of data, we were unable to evaluate the impact of these novel training modalities on student self-confidence.
Conclusion
Although innovative training modalities are equally effective to instructor-led training when teaching schoolchildren CPR, compression depth was frequently suboptimal. Recommendations on standardized training and evaluation methods are necessary to understand the best ways to train children.}

We discuss this concept with respect to the good society, and we suggest that trust may be more critical to emerging technologies than technologies in general.

This compliance approach is very useful for territorial security, environmental monitoring and safety prevention (in today pandemic context) and it is developed by the use of technologies (RFID, QR-CODE, NFC, blockchain) and HMI (Human Machine Interface) that it is fundamental core for data monitoring and information representation. The paper shows some new approaches about user HMI interface developed to collect big data about compliance and an innovative data representation approach using audio spectrum waves to record, share and evaluate compliance through an audio representation following a new process mapping approach.}

abstract = {Healthcare is of particular importance in everyone’s life, and keeping the advancement of it on a good pace is a priority of any country, as it highly influences the overall well-being of its citizens. Each government strives to build a modern, intelligent medical system that provides maximum population coverage with high-quality medical services. The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) significantly improves the accessibility and effectiveness of the healthcare system by forming the eHealth environment, thus, providing an opportunity to enhance the quality of patient care and significantly speed up the work of medical experts and reduce costs for medical services. Shifting medical services to digital and remote operations requires a lot of computational capabilities. Implementing new computing paradigms is prominent — remote services face new requirements due to the increasing data and demand for new computing solutions. Computing paradigms, e.g., Cloud, Edge, Mobile Edge Computing, besides others, are used to process the collected medical data, improving patient healthcare quality. This paper focuses on computing solutions for medical use cases by offering a comprehensive survey on standardization aspects, use cases, applicable computing paradigms, security limitations, and design considerations within the ICT usages for medical applications. Finally, it outlines the most critical integration challenges and solutions from the literature.}

It comprises a definition of forensic science and seven fundamental principles that emphasise the pivotal role of the trace as a vestige, or remnant, of an investigated activity. The Sydney Declaration also discusses critical features framing the forensic scientist’s work, such as context, time asymmetry, the continuum of uncertainties, broad scientific knowledge, ethics, critical thinking, and logical reasoning. It is argued that the proposed principles should underpin the practice of forensic science and guide education and research directions. Ultimately, they will benefit forensic science as a whole to be more relevant, effective and reliable.}

abstract = {In gentrifying communities, youth of color are often the subject of citizen-based policing by white residents, who use nonemergency 311 calls to police unwanted behaviors, eliminate incumbent symbols of ownership (e.g., graffiti), and gain control of the space. To date, little research has examined such policing efforts in neighborhoods experiencing environmental gentrification. In these neighborhoods, parks and greenways are often established to attract white newcomers, and thus citizen-based policing to ensure that parks remain “white spaces” might be particularly strong. Using a mixed-method design, we examined the citizen-based policing of youth proximate to Chicago’s 606, an urban greenway connected to environmental gentrification. Interviews revealed that white residents frequently and increasingly used citizen-based policing to monitor and control youth of color’s behaviors on The 606. In response, youth avoided greenway segments in white-majority neighborhoods, used the greenway when less populated, or avoided it altogether. A mixed-effects quasi-Poisson model supported these findings, showing that the number of graffiti-related 311 calls significantly increased in the years preceding and following the greenway’s opening, particularly in areas closest to The 606. Planners and policymakers need to recognize these issues and work to ensure park spaces in gentrifying areas promote inclusion and diversity.}

abstract = {Objective
We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance.
Background
Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity.
Method
Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone.
Results
In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate.
Conclusion
Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance.
Application
The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance.
Précis
High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

Thus, using Actor-Network Theory (ANT) associated with a single case study, the relevant actors in the formation of a socio-technical network resulting in the popular demonstrations that occurred in Brazil were identified. The study reveals that these demonstrations were comprised of different actors aligned around a single obligatory passage point, namely the social media. It was established that social media played an important role in this popular demonstration, prompting a change in the way citizens interact and unite, making formal organizations less necessary, and broadening the political participation of society. Nevertheless, the misalignment between the global and local network of actors led this uprising to fade out over time. Lastly, implications for practice and theory accrued from the investigation of this social media-enabled movement are set forth.}

abstract = {Water infiltration through soil is deemed the most serious problem and the main cause of concrete degradation in subway facilities. A huge amount of water intrusion may accelerate the deterioration mechanisms, such as rebar corrosion, spalling, and water voids. Such mechanisms can compromise the structural integrity and jeopardize public safety. The inspection and assessment of concrete structures are predominantly conducted based on visual inspection technologies. Although, these techniques may be consistent in detecting surface defects, e.g. cracks and spalling, they fall short in identifying subsurface distresses such as air voids, and water voids. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been extensively utilized for probing concrete infrastructure. Nevertheless, the deterioration mapping of air voids and water voids in concrete has seldom been performed. The objective of this paper is to develop an integrated model based on image processing of GPR profiles to automate air/water voids detection and mapping in subway systems. First, an automated localization scheme is developed to create a consistent inspection pattern. Second, subsurface data are collected in a subway facility, and processed using the image-based analysis technique. Third, the locations and dimensions of the detected defects are mapped to evaluate the severity of deterioration. The developed method is implemented on a tunnel in Montreal subway network. Then, validated via field inspection, digital images, coring samples, infrared thermography and 3D laser techniques. The validation outcomes reflect a strong correlation and compatibility with the generated GPR-based maps. The proposed framework is expected to assist infrastructure managers in identifying critical deficiencies and by focusing constrained funding on most deserving assets.}

The authors of these manuscripts were asked to propose future directions and challenges in their respective research areas. This paper summarises these proposals and concludes with general directions and challenges related to computing in civil and building engineering. The suggested directions include enhancing digital information modelling and extending the standardised product and process modelling technologies; improving decision-support capabilities and decision–implication analysis through integrating wider-aspects of the problem space; embedding optimisation techniques more holistically; and integrating all of these by making more use of virtualisation in an attempt to simplify the use of the output technologies. The challenges that will arise as a consequence will inevitably include reducing the inherent complexity in such a manner that the resulting models are both realistic and useable by all of the disciplines involved. Another main challenge is the inclusion of concepts that are significant but less readily formalised than traditional engineering ones. It could be argued that the high-level directions and challenges mentioned above are not very different from those that could have been predicted a considerable number of years ago. However, it is worth stressing that, with increased capabilities and reach of information technologies and greater expectations of decision makers, the current ambitions are an order of magnitude greater. The proposed directions and the resulting challenges are now much greater in both scale and breadth.}

Nowadays, technologies including Virtual Reality (VR) and Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) are shifting from the physical to the virtual paradigm. AR enables just to extend real-world environment, while VR and IVR allow to (re)create and manipulate digital environments. VR and IVR simulation systems have been observed to guarantee higher involvement and long-term information retention — leveraging more attractive experiences and psychological arousal. However, efforts should be provided to improve end-user training while assessing occupants’ behaviors and the effectiveness of the emergency plan. This paper proposes a systematic literature review of VR and IVR evacuation solutions. To support and guide such effort, we formulated thirteen structured research questions investigating scenarios, recipients, requirements, objectives, methods, and technologies. The results mainly show that VR and IVR drills almost entirely tackle a single hazard, considers occupants as sole system recipients, and lack systems formalization. Among the most relevant outcomes, the paper analyzes the need for enhancing the modeling of emergency systems (e.g., signage, alarms), user inclusiveness (i.e., impaired individuals), devices, non-player characters, and additional effects (e.g., heat reproduction, sounds, and smells). These measures can improve the level of realism experienced by the user of IVR simulators and pave the way to more reliable outcomes.}

The exploration of steganography using mocap data is still limited despite its wide-range of potential practical applications. Compared to image, audio, and video steganography, the challenges in mocap steganography arise from differences between the temporal lengths and topologies of the cover and secret data, non-zero residuals between mocap data sequences, non-repetitive movements in different chunks of the mocap data. Deep neural network (DNN) based hiding models could be a potential solution to address these challenges in mocap steganography. DNN-based steganography has been adopted in many recent works and has shown promising results in steganographic techniques in various domains, including image, audio and video; however, to date, no prior work has investigated the application of DNN models for hiding mocap data. In this paper, we investigate solutions to deal with the challenges in mocap steganography and propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network model, DSteganoM, to hide a sequence of skeletal motions into another. The proposed model is capable of learning and exploring the redundancy of spatial and temporal Euclidean positional information in each skeletal motion for the hiding task. In addition, by introducing upsampling and pooling mechanisms in our network architecture, the DSteganoM model also can hide mocap data of different topologies with different dimensions. Experimental results show that the proposed DSteganoM model outperforms other state-of-the-art models and can visually reconstruct the cover and secret with high resistance to signal perturbation. Our work bridges the research gap in applying deep steganography to address the challenges in mocap data hiding.}

It aims to enhance the psychological preparedness of the rescuer and thus promotes a more prompt and appropriate response. In this paper, we describe a cycle of three design-based research (DBR) studies in which HeartRun was explored with school children. In order to better understand how to design mobile game environments that support dimensions of seamless learning, we analysed children and their knowledge-building practices while learning with HeartRun. The mobile game has evolved significantly from its initial conception through an iterative process of (re) designing and testing the synchronization between physical and digital worlds, learner collaboration and ubiquitous knowledge access, i.e. dimensions of mobile seamless learning activities. Based on our experiences, we conclude by discussing challenges and shortcomings of mobile game–based learning environments.}

These features are important in services such as life assistance, direct marketing or localisation. The proposed infrastructure is based on the integration of heterogeneous resources under the umbrella of the distributed object paradigm. Our ultimate goal is to provide an efficient implementation of multi-user indoor localisation and orientation services.}

abstract = {The main objective of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is to bring computational capabilities at the edge of the network to better support low-latency applications. Such capabilities are typically offered by Edge Data Centers (EDC). The MEC paradigm is not tied to a single radio technology, rather it embraces both cellular and other radio access technologies such as WiFi. Distributed intelligence at the edge for AI purposes requires careful spatial planning of computing and storage resources. The problem of EDC deployment in urban environments is challenging and, to the best of our knowledge, it has been explored only for cellular connectivity so far. In this paper, we study the possibility of deploying EDC without analyzing the expected data traffic load of the cellular network, a kind of information rarely shared by network operators. To this purpose, we propose in this work CLUB, CLUstering-Based strategy tailored on the analysis of urban mobility. We analyze two experimental mobility data sets, and we analyze some mobility features in order to characterize their properties. Finally, we compare the performance of CLUB against state-of-the-art techniques in terms of the outage probability, namely the probability an EDC is not able to serve a request. Our results show that the CLUB strategy is always comparable with respect to our benchmarks, but without using any information related to network traffic.}

Though pedestrian safety is a shared responsibility, researchers suggest that distractions by smart devices and reduced cognitive skills are major causes of accidents. There is a scope to assist pedestrians through amplifying cognitive skills using heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors. These technologies could discover and warn users about unanticipated events such as just-in-time warnings about the hazards, distractions, extreme weather calamities, and potential impending dangers. An automated personalized agent helps monitor, diagnose problems, and protect people in an urban environment. Researchers have proposed various systems and implemented them in multiple domains. In this survey, we assessed, analyzed, and compared the most recent research on pedestrian safety. We identified the challenges, research gaps, and future directions toward using technology to improve pedestrian safety.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) now forms a more and more important part of human lives. After years focussed on the development of AI, the initial hype about its many expected benefits has gradually given way to rising ethical concerns about its inherent risks and dangers. Efforts to confront and contain the most serious risks related to AI have now prompted a number of legislative or regulatory proposals at the national, regional and global level. One of the most comprehensive regulatory initiatives is the European Union's proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), which was released in April 2021 with a view towards establishing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. To this end, the draft AIA pursues a proportionate horizontal and risk-based regulatory approach to AI, broadly classifying AI into the categories of unacceptable risks, high risks and low or minimal risks. The unacceptable risks are those that are deemed to contravene European Union values, and therefore, they are considered to be ‘prohibited AI practices’ by Article 5 AIA. The prohibited AI practices are classified into four categories, namely 1) AI systems deploying subliminal techniques; 2) AI practices exploiting vulnerabilities; 3) social scoring systems; and 4) ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. The proposed regulatory approach, however, appears problematic given the four categories’ inherent interrelatedness and the numerous possibilities for their mutual combination and entwinement. It is also problematic from the perspective of the human mind, as each of the four categories alone allows for the manipulation of human thought and behaviour, thereby endangering freedom of thought and other fundamental rights. In the context of the proposed AIA, both aspects give rise to unknown and unsolved conundrums that create difficult regulatory challenges that raise the necessity to also look at the wider implications of these technologies for the entire legal system. As these conundrums often find their expression in paradoxes and oxymora, this article calls for a wider interdisciplinary debate and advocates a different regulatory strategy using these concepts to transcend the limitations inherent in dualistic or dichotomous modes of legal thinking.}

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has been widely adopted for the creation of training experiences, since it appears to allow overcoming, especially for practical training, some of the limitations of real exercises. Many previous works focused on investigating the effectiveness of VR Training Systems (VRTS) in a variety of fields, but the efficacy of these systems is very task-dependent, and the best way to integrate them into existing learning paths has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The goal of the present paper is to explore the latter aspects considering a case study in the context of energy management in industry, and focusing on a measuring procedure that is part, e.g., of energy audit inspections. To this aim, a VRTS was developed and used to conduct two user studies: a first study designed to investigate the effectiveness of the devised system when used as an alternative or in combination with lecture and laboratory-based teaching experiences, and a second study aimed to compare two different approaches (traditional learning, TL, and learning by teaching, LBT) for exploiting the provided VR-based functionalities in a learning path. Experimental results showed that the use of the VRTS alone improved the participants’ performance compared to traditional experiences, and that LBT proved to be more effective that TL for practical learning purposes.}

Participants performed continuous mathematical calculations, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the math and counting tasks simultaneously. Performing the two tasks together resulted in significant dual-task interference. We also compared these results to previous studies employing the tone counting tasks with physically demanding tasks (climbing, kayaking and running). The interference between tone counting and mathematical calculations was worse than the interference between tone counting and running and kayaking. For climbing, the difference in interference was more nuanced with evidence indicating climbing uniquely asserts task prioritization. These findings have implications for operations requiring dual or multi-tasking.}

The sham augmentation system consisted of a brain–computer interface allegedly coordinated to play non-audible sounds that increase cognitive functions. However, no sounds were played throughout all conditions. We show a placebo effect in human augmentation, where a sustained belief of improvement remains after using the sham system and an increase in risk-taking conditional on heightened expectancy using Bayesian statistical modeling. Furthermore, we identify differences in event-related potentials in the electroencephalogram that occur during the sham condition when flipping loss cards.

The whole control is split into four subsystems- one to control each output. Simulation results of the same are presented to validate the proposed method. Further, Pluto 1.2, an open-source drone, is used as a testbed for the project. Since there was no prebuilt navigation support, a Vision-based Navigation system using an overhead camera and ArUco tags is developed. This estimated position is sent to Pluto 1.2 as a Multiwii Serial Protocol (MSP) packet via WiFi communication. For this, a new MSP command is written by modifying the drone’s firmware. Finally, the complete navigation and communication system are tested in flight. The system developed for Pluto 1.2 is a novel one and, therefore, a contribution to the Open source aerial robotics community.}

Cultural properties should be preserved because they reflect the local characteristics and knowledge of their creators. Therefore, damaged cultural properties, which are difficult to restore, should be among the first considerations in a disaster situation. In this paper, we propose a method for using geospatial information to promote cultural heritage resilience with respect to disasters. Images from satellites, drones, and terrestrial sensors are available in various forms and provide various types of information. The acquired data can be formed into a digital cultural heritage cube, which enables timely access to any desired data. Additional information can be derived from the accumulated data through image fusion processes and the ancestors’ knowledge encapsulated in cultural properties. To verify this, we explored two disasters—arson and forest fires—in Korea. We concluded that, if the proposed method is applied to cultural properties, the damage to culture assets can be minimised and their resilience can be enhanced.}

This paper comprehensively reviews experimental studies of pedestrian dynamics published between April 2017 and July 2019. The aim is to capture the unprecedented growth of the experimental literature, analyse the ways in which the research landscape is changing and identify the emerging topics. Laboratory crowd experiments were found to be the most popular method among all empirical methods, covering the most diverse range of topics and constituting nearly half of the empirical literature. The use of animal/insect crowd experiments, on the other hand, appears to be on the decline. Virtual-reality and evacuation-drill studies have maintained their popularity. Pedestrian flow at bottlenecks, walking behaviour and route choice persist to be the top conventional topics. However, new research themes have emerged or have notably gained heightened momentum. This includes the evacuation of vulnerable groups (i.e. elderly, children, mobility impaired), vertical evacuation, evacuation under limited visibility, social groups and evacuation training/education. While the top conventional topics are predominantly explored through laboratory crowd experiments, the methods of evacuation drills and virtual/augmented reality are proving more instrumental in studying the top emerging topics. This highlights the complementary relation of various experimental approaches in this field. More work seems to be needed to establish the transferability of experimental findings across methods, geometric layouts, contexts and demographics.}

abstract = {This paper explores a novel design of ergonomic gesture control with visual feedback for the UR3 collaborative robot that aims to allow users with little to no familiarity with robots to complete basic tasks and programming. The principle behind the design mirrors that of a 3D joystick but utilises the Leapmotion device to track the user's hands and prevents any need for a physical joystick or buttons. The Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) ergonomic tool was used to inform the design and ensure the system was safe for long-term use. The developed system was assessed using the RULA tool for an ergonomic score and through an experiment requiring 19 voluntary participants to complete a basic task with both the gesture system and the UR3's RTP (Robot Teach Pendant), then filling out SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaires to compare the usability of both systems. The task involved controlling the robot to pick up a pipe and then insert it into a series of slots of decreasing diameter, allowing for both the speed and accuracy of each system to be compared. The experiment found that even those with no previous robot experience were able to complete the tasks after only a brief description of how the gesture system works. Despite beating the RTP's ergonomic score, the system narrowly lost on average usability scores. However, as a contactless gesture system it has other advantages over the RTP and through this experiment many potential improvements were identified, paving the way for future work into assessing the significance of including the visual feedback and comparing this system against other gesture-based systems.
Relevance to Industry
In industrial environments where the robots may need to be frequently reprogrammed through complex RTPs, companies must call on those with specialist training even to make minor adjustments. The presented system takes advantage of gesture control to allow for easy interaction with industrial robots, even for untrained operators.}

We first examine the metaverse’s technologies and its underlying business models, which hold immense strategic implications for organizations and industries, and might require rethinking the future of work. As with most emerging technologies able to generate, collect, and process user data, the metaverse comes at a price; leveraging the metaverse strategically will require ethical and DEI considerations. After examining all these aspects of the metaverse, we reflect on ways IS scholarship engaged in strategizing can advance theoretical and practical knowledge by generating novel research questions and outlining a research agenda. Our contribution is twofold: first, we analyze the metaverse using a sociotechnical lens, thereby setting the ground for future studies of the phenomenon. Second, we identify specific strategic implications as well as DEI opportunities and challenges associated with the metaverse, and discuss how scholarship versed in IS strategizing can contribute to addressing them, both theoretically and empirically.}

However, it is very challenging to predict crowd emotion using conventional emotion clues of humans from the video surveillance data, e.g. facial expression or body gesture. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a crowd emotion evaluation method using fuzzy inference according to the arousal-valence model of the crowd movement. Specifically, the enthalpy, magnitude variance, confusion index and crowd density are extracted to describe crowd emotion. The enthalpy value and magnitude variance are taken as the input of the fuzzy inference system of arousal. And the confusion index and crowd density are used as the input of the fuzzy system of valence. The arousal value and valence value are the output respectively. Through establishing the relationship between arousal, valence and crowd features, the fuzzy rules are constructed to infer the emotion in the crowd scene. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the arousal and valence in crowd emotion.}

The main objective of this research is to enhance route preemption and optimization of emergency vehicle trips through automated data restoring and harvesting approaches with the existing data. This research restores vehicle paths of emergency vehicles with a pathfinding algorithm and harvests spatial data along with the restored vehicle paths. Dijkstra's algorithm and the proposed data harvesting methods are used to bring the enriched data to analyze the emergency vehicle routes. Based on the enriched data, two applications are developed to identify which factors have significant impacts on emergency response time and which intersections and specific driving routes at these intersections have more impact on emergency response time.

The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. Our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners’ thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making.}

Main issues in WSN are represented by the large number of sensor nodes, multi-hop communication approach, and needs for an efficient use of available limited sensor energy. In this work an emergency scenario is considered and a WSN is used as a communication infrastructure. To limit the power consumption, the WSN is activated only when the emergency occurs. Few mobile nodes (the rescuers) are moving in the area. In these critical network scenarios, adaptive routing is essential to ensure reliable communication with first responders. At the same time, localizing both WSN nodes and moving nodes is an essential issue for routing the rescuers towards victims. In this paper, the authors jointly tackle routing and localization problems for reducing the network signaling communication as much as possible, which is the most power-consuming operation in WSNs. In particular, it is proposed a distributed localization algorithm, based on a ranging technique, designed by mapping the localization into a stochastic estimation problem for systems with uncertainties.}

abstract = {Safety footwear is used throughout many different industrial sectors to ensure a degree of worker safety. However, since their adoption in the 1920s, the design of safety footwear has experienced few technology advancements. Since becoming commonplace in the 1970s the majority of safety footwear is bought off-the-shelf without much thought given to the exacting user requirements or operational environment. A literature review was conducted, indicating that ongoing developments remain based upon historical concepts. The requirement for radical change is compelling due to the poor comfort, fit, aesthetic appeal offered by current designs, need for frequent replacement and lack of application specific safety footwear. In addition, both safety footwear design and manufacture continues to lag behind other types of footwear production most notably, athletic footwear. This paper introduces a radical new vision for safety-smart footwear, produced on a mass customization basis that is integrated functionally with the operational environment and various safety systems in line with Industry 4.0 philosophies of automation and digitalization. This vision of safety-smart footwear not only has the potential to support operational functions, but can help to mitigate safety risks and raise alarms. Through this, end user and operational data is continually fed back via cloud based data repositories to provide ongoing design iterations both at a customized user level and industry-specific level. By realizing the vision for safety-smart footwear presented in this paper, it is expected that benefits will include improved user comfort and fit, increased aesthetic appeal and enhanced user safety, specific to their industrial environment. This has the potential to have knock on societal impacts that go beyond the industrial environment.}

Video surveillance is a key technology to fight against terrorism and public safety management. In video surveillance, detection of moving objects from a video is important for object detection and behaviour understanding. Detection of moving objects in video streams is important process of revelation and background subtraction is popular approach for foreground segmentation. In this paper high speed background subtraction algorithm for moving object detection is proposed. The video is first converted to streams and then applied to convolution filter which removes high frequency noise components to obtain smoothened images. The smoothened images are then applied to background subtraction algorithm with adaptive threshold which gives detected object present in background image. The detected object is then applied to convolution filter to remove the spurious distorted pixels which improves the quality of image. The proposed architecture was designed using VHDL language and implemented using Spartan-6 (XC6SLX45-2csg324) FPGA kit. It is observed that the proposed technique is better compared to existing method in terms of image quality and speed of operations.}

Ethification shall be understood as a proliferation of moral principles and moral values in the legal discourse within the areas of research, innovation governance, or directly enforceable rules in the industry. Although the ethical considerations may seem distant from mere regulatory compliance, the opposite is true. The article focuses on the positive side of the “ethification” of digital laws through the lens of legal requirements for impact assessments pursuant to General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessments in the proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act. Authors argue that ethical considerations are often absent in the context of using new technologies including artificial intelligence, yet they may provide additional value for organizations and society as a whole. Additionally, carrying out ethics-based assessments is already in line with existing regulatory requirements in the fields of data protection law and proposed EU AI regulation. These arguments are reflected in the context of facial recognition technology, where both data protection impact assessment under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessment under the proposal of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act will be mandatory. Facial recognition technology is analyzed through the ethics-based assessment involving stakeholder analysis, data flows map, and identification of risks and respective countermeasures to show additional insights that ethics provides beyond regulatory requirements.}

The novelty of our methodology lies in the semantic linking of video object recognition results from visual and thermal cameras with Building Information Models (BIM). The current limitations and possibilities of certain building information streams in the context of fire safety or fire incident management are addressed in this paper. Furthermore, our data management tools match higher-level semantic metadata descriptors of BIM and deep-learning based visual object recognition and classification networks. Based on these matches, estimations can be generated of camera, objects and event positions in the BIM model, transforming it from a static source of information into a rich, dynamic data provider. Previous work has already investigated the possibilities to link BIM and low-cost point sensors for fireground understanding, but these approaches did not take into account the benefits of video analysis and recent developments in semantics and feature learning research. Finally, the strengths of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art is its (semi-)automatic workflow, generic and modular setup and multi-modal strategy, which allows to automatically create situational awareness, to improve localization and to facilitate the overall fire understanding.}

In this paper, we design and assess a touch user interface that is built on a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) to allow peers to exchange tactile signals in VR applications. First, we explored the interface capabilities by assessing different gestures to be adopted in the reproduction of tactile signals. Then, we assessed its use in conjunction with a vibrotactile HMD in a collaborative virtual setup where users could communicate only through vibrotactile cues. Results have shown that accuracy in target localization increases as target density decreases, that swipe gestures are performed with more accuracy when supported by anchor-points, and that accuracy of rhythm reproduction decreases with pace. When applied to a collaborative task, the interface presented high usability and allowed subjects to fully use tactile feedback as a means for intercommunication with their partners.}

abstract = {Illegal hunting and trade might be reduced by devaluing the commodities of live animals. However, theory and anecdote suggest that the tactic’s success depends on the proportion devalued and may also generate unintuitive and counter-productive outcomes. Unfortunately, the difficulty of researching criminals limits empirical and experimental tests of theory and practice. We overcame those constraints by designing and conducting a competitive game; simulating criminal hunting of protected wildlife where the proportion of animals devalued across a meta-population increases at a cost to investment in security. We conducted 33 games each with 10 different volunteers from the public visiting five public events (fairs, gala, and carnivals) in different communities of the Wellington metropolitan area, New Zealand. Games confirmed the relative effectiveness of security over devaluation tactics. Even moderate security protected the majority of commodities, but only when devaluation reached extraordinary levels (≥90%) was it protective, and even then only partially. When the risk of hunting is low, reduced rewards were enough to still motivate hunting. Games also revealed that when security and devaluation tactics are mixed across a meta-population, elevated risk caused hunters to revise their valuation of devalued commodities upwards and hunt and harvest them anyway. Counter-intuitively, more valuable devalued commodities were preserved but those of lesser value harvested, then sometimes discarded but at other times their value claimed. And lastly, hunters choose to take greater risks, shifting their activities to adjacent populations where the returns could be greater even though known to be better protected. The survival of wildlife in those populations deteriorated, even as the number of hunters caught increased. In all these ways, our games demonstrated how the addition of devaluation tactics to strategies for protecting wildlife can incentivise and exacerbate, rather than mitigate, the illegal hunting and trade of wildlife, consistent with theory and anecdote.}

AI is described both in the abstract and in four forms that are currently evident not only in laboratories but also in real-world applications. Clarity about the public's concerns is sought by articulating the threats that are inherent within AI. It is proposed that AI needs to be re-conceived as `complementary artefact intelligence', and that the robotics notion of `machines that think' needs to give way to the idea of `intellectics', with the focus on `computers that do'. This article lays a foundation for two further articles on how organisations can adopt a responsible approach to AI, and how an appropriate regulatory scheme for AI can be structured.}

All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.}

However, how to apply these features of the DT to better manage smart cities (SCs) has not yet been systematically summarized and analysed. In this study, 202 papers on DT-supported SCs are reviewed, based on which the drivers and challenges of applying DT-supported SCs and the solutions for the challenges were identified. In addition, this study explored the possible outcomes of applying DT-supported technologies in SCs. This study also contributes to the DT-supported SCs for city management research and practice.}

The proposed BDI agent framework allows modeling of human behavior with a high degree of fidelity. The realistic attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are reverse-engineered by conducting human-in-the-loop experiments in the VR-based Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes (e.g., maps, demographics, evacuation management parameters). The validity of the proposed data models are tested with two different evacuation scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effect of various crowd evacuation management parameters on the key performance indicators in the evacuation scenario such as crowd evacuation rate and densities. The results reveal that constructed simulation can be used as an effective emergency management tool.}

abstract = {Given the global increase in crippling cyberattacks, organizations are increasingly turning to cyberthreat intelligence (CTI). CTI represents actionable threat information that is relevant to a specific organization and that thus demands its close attention. CTI efforts aim to help organizations “know their enemies better” for proactive, preventive, and timely threat detection and remediation—complementing conventional risk-management paradigms designed to improve ‘general readiness’ against known or unknown threats. Organizational security (OrgSec) and behavioral security research has lagged behind CTI's growing potential to address current cybersecurity challenges. Instead, CTI has largely been the purview of computer science from an algorithmic perspective. However, OrgSec and behavioral researchers can contribute a further combined knowledge of design for the organization, human factors, and organizational governance to foster CTI. In this theory-building and review manuscript, we propose the CTI capability model (CTI-CM) to prescribe the key capabilities necessary for a CTI practitioner to engage effectively in CTI activities. The CTI-CM defines a practitioner's CTI capability in terms of three highly interrelated but conceptually distinctive dimensions: analytical component capability, contextual response capability, and experiential practice capability. We further explain how these capabilities can be fostered, and the key implications for leading security practice in organizations.}

This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city’s best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city’s digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation.}

Furthermore, the integration of Industry 4.0 tools can further boost the previous with its communication and connectivity ability. Knowledge on these aspects is available in academia as well as in practice, but, as this paper argues, not structured for making decisions that consider all of these aspects in an integrated way aiming at improving equipment uptime.

Hundred and seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria, most of them used qualitative methods. The findings provide insights into the potential impact of digital placemaking practices for urban nature on citizens’ wellbeing and mental health. Our results indicated an absence of agreement on the concept of digital placemaking, and a lack of blue space research while nature was presented as a context and passive element. Mental health and wellbeing are mostly approached without specifically examining health indicators or assessing the health impact of these practices. Our study proposes a model offering insights into the broad range of best practices for implementing digital placemaking for nature and wellbeing and represents a key contribution to understanding the innovative application of augmenting NBS through digital placemaking impacting the wellbeing of citizens.}

The results show that the focus on human needs and context of use is limited. It is argued that a reduction of the focus on technical advancements in favor of the needs of the users and the healthcare community, underpinned by human factors and ergonomics theory, is favorable. Due to the low number of identified articles describing or discussing human-centered approaches it is furthermore concluded that the publication culture promotes technical descriptions and summative evaluations rather than descriptions and reflections regarding the design and development processes. Shifting the focus from a technology-centered approach to a human-centered one can aid in the process of creating simulation systems for training in healthcare that are: 1) relevant to the learning objectives, 2) adapted to the needs of users, context and task, and 3) not selected based on technical or fidelity criteria.}

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes.

Among the three stimuli factors, the citizens of Busan perceived the importance of ubiquity and autonomy most highly. However, the citizens of Sejong considered information exchange and ubiquity as crucial determinants of satisfaction. The findings revealed that the significant stimuli factors are not the same between smart cities, and there can be differences in the detailed attributes required in smart cities.}

Innovative assistance techniques are especially necessary for elderly people who live on their own in their homes. Simultaneously, an explosive growth in IoT gadgets such as sensors and actuators have accelerated the development of smart homes which comprise various types of IoT systems that provide increased convenience to people with degenerating physical and cognitive abilities. Common examples of IoT systems that are being integrated into smart homes include home automation systems, home activity detectors, wearable sensor technologies for remote health management and so on. We identify the common needs of aging and impaired individuals and then we review several IoT applications that can provide the required support.

abstract = {During the last decade, research and development in the field of multi access edge computing (MEC) has rapidly risen to prominence. One of the factors propelling MEC’s evolution is the ability to deploy edge servers capable of providing both communication and computational services in close proximity to the mobile user terminal. MEC has been regarded as a potentially transformative technique for fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless communication systems, as well as a possible complement to traditional cloud computing. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with MEC will play a critical role by introducing an additional mobility based computational layer to provide more secure, efficient and faster services. UAV enabled MEC offers seamless connectivity, fulfilling the promise of 5G’s ubiquitous connectivity. Due to the enormous interest in UAV enabled MEC, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of published research articles in this domain; however, the research area still lacks a systematic study and categorization. We present a systematic literature review (SLR) on UAV enabled MEC, examining and analyzing data on the current state of the art using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. To streamline our assessment, this study analyzes several research papers carefully selected through a multi-stage process satisfying the eligibility criteria defined in the paper. One of the SLR’s primary contributions is to broadly classify the research in the UAV enabled MEC domain into different categories including energy efficiency, resource allocation, security, architecture, and latency. We have identified key findings, technology, and pros and cons for the selected articles under each category. Additionally, we discuss the key open issues related to scalability and fairness, resource allocation and offloading optimization, service delivery with a focus on quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS), and standardization. Finally, we discuss several future research directions that would address the aforementioned issues and emerging use cases for UAV enabled MEC.}

A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize prior research on drones and cumulatively identify current knowledge gaps which require further investigation. In order to identify the relevant literature on the topic, a rigorous research protocol was applied for the retrieval and selection processes. In total, 142 publications fulfilled the selection criteria and were thoroughly analyzed. The findings of this review paper summarize the capabilities, barriers and performance outcomes of humanitarian drones applied to logistics operations, management, and governance in a comprehensive framework. More specifically, three important capabilities (i.e., transportation and delivery; surveying and monitoring; communication and integration), three performance outcomes (i.e., flexibility and responsiveness; cost reduction; sustainability) and adoption barriers in three areas (i.e., technology; organization; environment) were identified. Based on these findings, future research directions are derived for the capabilities of humanitarian drones, their performance outcomes, and their respective barriers. This study analyzes potential applications of drones in the humanitarian field and presents a comprehensive agenda that structures and guides further research on the topic.}

A new fully unsupervised anomaly detection and classification method has been proposed. It has three stages: training of a 3D Convolution Autoencoder using pseudo-labelled video segments, anomaly detection using latent features, and classification. Unlike the existing datasets, we have benchmarked RareAnom using three levels of supervision: fully, weakly, and unsupervised. It has been compared with UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The proposed anomaly detection and classification method beats the latest unsupervised methods by 4.49%, 8.66%, and 6.77% on RareAnom, UCF-Crime, and XD-violence datasets, respectively.}

While there are many indoor localisation methods, each has its advantages and disadvantages, taking into consideration various factors such as the effect of the indoor environment, ease of implementation, computational cost, positioning accuracy, etc. In other words, no single solution can cater for all different situations. Although many survey papers have been published on indoor positioning, new techniques and methods are proposed every year, so it is important to stay abreast of its latest developments. In addition, each survey has its own classification for indoor positioning systems without a common scheme. Inspired by the well-known OSI model and TCP/IP model, it would be desirable to develop a systematic framework for studying indoor positioning systems. In this paper, we make this new contribution by introducing a systemic survey framework based on a six-layer model to give a comprehensive survey of indoor positioning systems, namely: device layer, communication layer, network layer, data layer, method layer and application layer. Complementing the previous survey papers, this paper provides a survey of the latest research works on indoor positioning based on the six-layer model. Our emphasis is on systematic categorisation, machine learning-based enhancements, collaborative localisation and COVID-19-related applications. The six-layer model should provide a useful framework and new insights for the research community.}

abstract = {Human skeleton posture reconstruction is an essential component for human–computer interactions (HCI) in various application domains. Traditional approaches usually rely on either cameras or on-body sensors, which induce privacy concerns or inconvenient practical setups. To address these practical concerns, this paper proposes a low-cost contactless skeleton posture reconstruction system, mPose, which can reconstruct a user’s 3D skeleton postures using a single mmWave device. mPose does not require the user to wear any sensors and can enable a broad range of emerging mobile applications (e.g., VR gaming and pervasive user input) via mmWave-5G ready Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Particularly, the system extracts multi-dimensional spatial information from mmWave signals which characterizes the skeleton postures in a 3D space. To mitigate the impacts of environmental changes, mPose dynamically detects the user location and extracts spatial features from the mmWave signals reflected only from the user. Furthermore, we develop a deep regression method with a domain discriminator to learn a mapping between the spatial features and the joint coordinates of human body while removing subject-specific characteristics, realizing robust posture reconstruction across users. Extensive experiments, involving 17 representative body postures, 7 subjects, and 3 indoor environments, show that mPose outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art RF-based solutions with a lower average joint error of only ∼30 mm, while achieving transferability across environments and subjects at the same time.}

Since then, hazard maps for tsunami flooding have been prepared or updated nationwide. These maps assume flooding in the event of a tsunami of the extreme class (L2) with a recurrence interval of 1000 years, in which the top priority is to protect lives. However, once an earthquake occurs, the situation of inundation differs depending on the earthquake rupture mechanisms and its magnitude, so the area of unexpected damage needs to be grasped as soon as possible. Therefore, a forecast of tsunami inundation and damage needs to be provided immediately after the disaster to support disaster responders’ decisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to utilize a tsunami inundation and damage forecast. Specifically, we introduce “recovery levels”, which allow areas that need immediate response to be more easily recognized to allocate human and physical resources. We evaluated their usefulness from the viewpoint of disaster responders by surveying users in a local government through a disaster response drill and an explanatory meeting. Consequently, it was found that the recognition and understanding of the tsunami forecast advanced, and many positive opinions were obtained about utilizing the forecast in the initial activity of disaster response.}

We then use an adapted version of this methodology to design an abstract generic system meta-model for a multi-robot application, which can be used as a basis for the design of these systems, avoiding or shortening repetitive tasks common to most systems. Based on the proposed Generic Robotic Agent Meta-Model (GRAMM), two distinct models for two different applications are derived, demonstrating the versatility and adaptability of the meta-model.

However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn.

abstract = {Objective
Virtual (VR), augmented (AR), mixed reality (MR) and haptic interfaces make additional avenues available for surgeon assessment, guidance and training. We evaluated applications for open trauma and emergency surgery to address the question: Have new computer-supported interface developments occurred that could improve trauma training for civilian and military surgeons performing open, emergency, non-laparoscopic surgery?
Design
Systematic literature review.
Setting and Participants
Faculty, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore., Maryland; Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.
Methods
Structured literature searches identified studies using terms for virtual, augmented, mixed reality and haptics, as well as specific procedures in trauma training courses. Reporting bias was assessed. Study quality was evaluated by the Kirkpatrick's Level of evidence and the Machine Learning to Asses Surgical Expertise (MLASE) score.
Results
Of 422 papers identified, 14 met inclusion criteria, included 282 enrolled subjects, 20% were surgeons, the remainder students, medics and non-surgeon physicians. Study design was poor and sample sizes were low. No data analyses were beyond descriptive and the highest outcome types were procedural success, subjective self-reports, except three studies used validated metrics. Among the 14 studies, Kirkpatrick's level of evidence was level zero in five studies, level 1 in 8 and level 2 in one. Only one study had MLASE Score greater than 9/20. There was a high risk of bias in 6 studies, uncertain bias in 5 studies and low risk of bias in 3 studies.
Conclusions
There was inadequate evidence that VR,MR,AR or haptic interfaces can facilitate training for open trauma surgery or replace cadavers. Because of limited testing in surgeons, deficient study and technology design, risk of reporting bias, no current well-designed studies of computer-supported technologies have shown benefit for open trauma, emergency surgery nor has their use shown improved patient outcomes. Larger more rigorously designed studies and evaluations by experienced surgeons are required for a greater variety of procedures and skills.

Possibilities of the application are, among others: selection of visibility level of certain organs or groups of organs, creation of complex sections in 3 planes and launching animations of selected organs. Application of each selected device required additional programming work. The work included both adaptation of Graphical User Interface for different display resolutions, as well as preparation of communication between integrated orientation tracking systems and the application, because none of the selected low-cost HMDs has a position tracking system, to allow navigation in the virtual space, two low-cost solutions were proposed, as well as traditional approach in form of a professional tracking system. First of the proposed low-cost solutions is application of a dedicated, customized controller built in the PUT VR Laboratory using commercial electronics and 3D printing technologies. The second solution is controlling the navigation via specific gestures recognized by the Kinect low-cost tracking device. After application was developed, a group of students tested all possibilities of interaction with the virtual environment using a professional HMD and both low-cost display and tracking solutions. During the evaluation performed by the test group, features like field of view, weight of devices and general impressions and feeling after prolonged use were taken into consideration. Intuitiveness of the proposed navigation solutions was evaluated separately.

Currently, because of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in facility O&M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O&M research and application developments from a facility manager's point of view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising future research directions. The scope of this research includes the academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using BIM to improve selected facility O&M activities, including maintenance and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation management, and security. The content analysis results show that research on BIM for O&M is still in its early stage and most of the current research has focused on energy management. We have identified that the interoperability in the BIM-O&M context is still a challenge and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to understand the underlying O&M principles for BIM implementation – data requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition, more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are required to justify the value of BIM-O&M applications and an improved Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications.}

When enabling D2D communication in the system, one can see several benefits compared to the conventional infrastructure based communication, such as improved energy efficiency, increased overall system throughput and decreased traffic load in the network. The aim of this paper is to give an energy efficiency perspective of D2D communication to assist all major mobile stakeholders to perceive the benefits when facilitating D2D communication in the network. This paper is tutorial in nature, initially elaborating on the fundamental concept surrounding D2D communication towards technical perspective, business opportunities and open challenges when considering deployment. Furthermore, a simulation study of a typical D2D use case is carried out that includes the energy efficiency perspective; we use 3GPP Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) as a baseline technology and candidate for launching D2D communications.}

Six archetypes emerged from the data, and were named Growth & Decay, Threats & New Hopes, Wasteworlds, The Powers that Be, Disarray, and Inversion. The archetypes in part overlap with and confirm previous research, and in part are novel. They all involve stress-point critical conditions in the external environment. We explain why the six archetypes, as a foresight framework, is more transformational and nuanced than previously developed scenario archetypes frameworks, making it particularly suited to the current necessity to think the unthinkable more systematically. We explain how the six archetypes framework can be used as predetermined images of the future to create domain specific scenarios, making organizations more resilient to critical, disruptive futures. We finally present and discuss a case study of the application of the method to create scenarios of post-Covid-19 futures of work.

A systematic literature review was carried out by searching databases and the profiles of the top researchers in this field to identify the journal papers, conference articles, and theses that have addressed the barriers from 2000 to 2019. The search process resulted in 78 documents with 14 barriers recorded. A critical analysis of the barriers was then conducted. The final analysis suggests four areas for improvement to overcome the identified barriers. Addressing the barriers can lead to a better realisation of simulation benefits in the industry, thus stimulating the uptake of simulation in construction.}

The literature sources are classified according to the difference between UX and usability for various target products and services, including healthcare. The literature is reviewed with a focus on human-oriented aspects. This includes medical technology and device design, which are dependent on the user type, medical device scope, and area of use. A review of key medical device standards and regulation documents is presented. The main analysis methodologies for the UX and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The future challenges in healthcare and medical ergonomics are briefly highlighted. Above all, this study tried to examine the difference between usability and UX of general products and those of medical devices through the review of existing literature. Even standards do not reflect this well and need to be considered based on further research in academia and industry.
Relevance to industry
The obtained results will help medical-device designers and healthcare professionals understand the main medical-research trends and improve the design process. Additionally, they will be helpful for increasing the satisfaction level among medical-device users and reducing user risks.}

This paper presents a novel approach that includes an interaction organization pattern for Multi-agent Systems (MASs) in crisis management, abstracted from several existing case studies in which the agents follow a sequence of interactions and the organization must optimize the use of human resources. The pattern considers an emergent organization of peers that adopt different roles according to the circumstances. The key features of the organization are its robustness, scalability (in terms of both agents and roles), flexibility to deal with a changing environment, and the efficient use of resources. In order to validate the organization, the paper presents its modeling and development with the Ingenias methodology, conforming the corresponding MAS. This development follows a model-driven approach, which allows a smooth transition from the specification to the code, and a low-cost testing of the system with different settings. Another key aspect is the application of metrics for validating and improving the MAS in terms of response time. The MAS has been tested with 600 agents representing 200 citizens, showing its performance.}

The results are as follows. (1) The distribution of OpenStreetMap road density in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao predominantly obeys a “positive skewness distribution”. OpenStreetMap data for eastern China shows a higher overall and circular structure. In central China, there are noticeable discrepancies in the road density, whereas in western China, the road density is low. (2) The OpenStreetMap road diversity shows a normal distribution. The spatial pattern for the so-called “Hu Huanyong line” was broken by the effect of diplomatic and strategic factors, showing a high diversity along the peripheral border, coastal cities, and core inland cites. (3) China’s OpenStreetMap is partitioned into four parts according to road density and diversity: high density and high diversity; low density and low diversity; high density and low diversity; and low density high diversity. (4) The OpenStreetMap geographical information-collection process and mechanism were analyzed, demonstrating that the road density reflects the preponderance of traffic in the real world. OpenStreetMap road diversity reflects the road-related geographic information demand and value, and it also reflects the interests of users toward to OpenStreetMap geographical information.}

To provide a comprehensive overview on the utilization and effectiveness of telesimulation in healthcare education.
Design
A scoping review.
Data sources
A search of five databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, EMBASE and ProQuest was conducted between 2000 and 2022.
Review methods
Arksey and O′ Malley's scoping review framework was utilised. Data were narratively synthesised.
Results
29 articles were included. More than half of the publications on telesimulation were borne out of need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovation reports were the most prevalent publications followed by descriptive studies. Telesimulation was applied for the delivery of diverse learning content including patient care management, procedural skills and team training. A variety of videoconferencing software and simulation modalities have been used for telesimulation. Telesimulation was generally well-received, despite its technical challenges. Learning effectiveness of telesimulation was evident in quasi-experimental studies.
Conclusion
Telesimulation has been gaining acceptance as a distance-based simulation education modality. It will continue to evolve and potentially blend with in-person simulation. More rigorous research is warranted to evaluate learning outcomes and establish best practices in telesimulation.}

The authors implemented this research by using the Personal Dead Reckoning positioning system to serve as the inertial navigation based positioning system. The primary contribution of the presented work is the development and implementation of the Integrated Tracking System algorithm which was implemented in two levels. At the first level, the Integrated Tracking System (ITS) was developed by integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) and Personal Dead Reckoning (PDR) system to ubiquitously track a mobile user, in dynamic environments where GPS coverage may be uncertain. At the second level, the PDR system was integrated with a database of pre-determined known indoor location points in order to correct the accumulated drift error during a mobile user’s navigation in an indoor environment. Finally, a hybrid tracking system was developed and implemented by integrating the PDR system with the mobile user’s intervention and discernment of the environment. The implementation and the results obtained from validation experiments performed on the aforementioned hybrid tracking systems demonstrate the potential of using hybrid tracking for determining the spatial context of mobile users in ubiquitous context-aware engineering applications.}

abstract = {Crowd anomaly detection has been a research hotspot in the field of video surveillance in recent years. In most existing methods, the accuracy of anomaly detection dominantly relies on the acquisition of regions of interest (ROI) and feature extraction. However, the randomness of ROI segmentation and crowd group selection usually cannot guarantee a robust performance and thus may lead to false detection sometimes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a scene perception-based approach combining the fluid forces expression and psychological theory. The proposed method firstly introduces a flow field Visualization technology called line integral convolution to segment the moving pedestrians in the scene. Then, a scene perception-guided clustering strategy is proposed to cluster the consistency crowd group. Scene perception strategy is in line with the psychological criteria of human cognition. In clustering, it makes more reasonable use of various attributes of the pedestrians. To ensure a robust detection of the pedestrian group, we propose a fluid feature concept which considers both mass force and surface force. For each consistency group, two types of features including the image appearance feature and fluid feature are combined to describe pedestrian motion. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in comparison with some existing methods in terms of both frame-level and pixel-level measurements.}

Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse. Although still experimental, Metaverse is expected to revolutionize travel and tourism management and marketing. It empowers destination awareness, positioning and branding, as well as coordination and management, through digital twins. Metaverse provides opportunities to support trip planning, interaction and engagement, effectively transforming consumer behaviour. Visiting and engaging with destinations virtually is expected to motivate real travel, rather than replace it.

Drawing on a systematic review of scholarly works, articles from media and industry reports, this study defines and conceptualizes the Metaverse ecosystem for tourism and travel. It explores the foundations of the disruptions that Metaverse brings to tourism destinations and organisations and identifies the building blocks of Metaverse tourism. The study outlines research directions so that the tourism industry can take full advantage of the Metaverse capabilities and opportunities emerging as well as identify challenges for the future.}

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

abstract = {360-degree video is an immersive technology used in research across academic disciplines. This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

The primary contribution of the presented work is the design and implementation of a dynamic user-viewpoint tracking scheme in which mobile users’ spatial context is defined not only by their position (i.e., location), but also by their three-dimensional head orientation (i.e., line of sight). This allows the identification of objects and artifacts visible in a mobile user’s field of view with much higher accuracy than was possible by tracking position alone. For outdoor applications, a georeferencing based algorithm has been developed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and magnetic orientation tracking devices [5] to track a user’s dynamic viewpoint. For indoor applications, this study explored the applicability of wireless technologies, in particular Indoor GPS, for dynamic user position tracking in situations where GPS is unavailable. The objectives of this paper are to describe the details of the three-stage-algorithm that has been designed and implemented, and to demonstrate the extent to which positioning technologies such as GPS and Indoor GPS can be used together with high-precision orientation trackers to accurately interpret the fully-qualified spatial context of a mobile user in challenging environments such as those found on construction sites. The obtained results highlight the potential of using location-aware technologies for rapidly identifying and retrieving contextual information in engineering applications.}

It dissects the anticipated further erosion of personal privacy – the focus area of the essay – caused by technological developments and related interests. After sketching out an ironic dystopia, in which the idea of transparency is foisted upon the public by future technological developments, the author contemplates the relationships between legal regulation and the underlying values in the predictable but unknowable milieu of future life conditions. While studying the immutability of fundamental values, the author offers a brief survey of the role of public opinion, as well as of the limitations of taking into account the majority opinion, followed by a thought experiment about the possible ways of regulating the “Code”, approaching it from the direction of two fundamental rights, the right to human dignity and the freedom of academic research. After reaching conflicting conclusions and making a few suggestions about possible ways to regulate the area, the author makes a proposal about the introduction of a small-scale experimental tool, metaphorically named as a predictive learning model of regulation. Despite the difficulties and the uncertainties, the essay's overall perspective on the role of legal regulation is not a pessimistic one, as long as it is used flexibly and in conjunction with other means of regulation.}

To fulfill the promise of autonomy, vehicle operators will not be concerned with manual control of the vehicle; instead, they will deal with the overall mission. Furthermore, the one operator to many vehicles is becoming a constant meme with various industries including package delivery, search and rescue, and utility companies. In order for an operator to concurrently control several vehicles, his station must look and behave very differently than the current ground control station instantiations. Furthermore, the vehicle will have to be much more autonomous, especially during non-normal operations, in order to accommodate the knowledge deficit or the information overload of the operator in charge of several vehicles. The expected usage increase of small drones requires presenting the operational information generated by a fleet of heterogeneous autonomous agents to an operator. NASA Langley Research Center's Autonomy Incubator has brought together researchers in various disciplines including controls, trajectory planning, systems engineering, and human factors to develop an integrated system to study autonomy issues. The initial human factors effort is focusing on mission displays that would give an operator the overall status of all autonomous agents involved in the current mission. This paper will discuss the specifics of the mission displays for operators controlling several vehicles.}

abstract = {Building fires are a common urban disaster. The emergence of high-rise, large-scale and inner-complex buildings bring new challenges for fire safety and triggers new demand to upgrade traditional building fire alarm system (FAS). Different from current studies by deploying enormous smart fire sensors to replace FAS, this study addresses this issue from a novel perspective and proposes a cloud-based FAS using Building Information Modelling (BIM) on top of FAS, termed CloudFAS. Firstly, the system framework and the software architecture are designed. Secondly, two key technologies are presented to address two unresolved technical issues: private fire alarm data sharing and alignment of fire sensors with the BIM model. A cloud gateway for fire sensors is developed to address the first problem by capturing the fire alarm data from the fire alarm control unit through the IEEE 1824 standard. Noticing that the fire sensor locations are listed in a sensor installation spreadsheet using natural language, termed as sensor location table (SLT). A natural language processing (NLP)-based sensor-BIM alignment algorithm is proposed to automatically match fire sensors with the BIM model through SLT, which enables to display fire sensor statuses in proper places in the 3D BIM model. Finally, a concrete case study from the China Construction Library is presented, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed CloudFAS. Our CloudFAS is built on top of traditional FAS. If the fire alarm control unit follows the IEEE 1824 standard and an SLT is available, then CloudFAS can upgrade the traditional FAS in existing buildings effortlessly with its BIM model. Moreover, the cloud gateway for fire sensors contributes to addressing the private data sharing problem using IEEE 1824 standard, and the NLP-based sensor-BIM alignment algorithm can promote the adoption of BIM in the building operation phase.}

It is critical for the government to embrace new technology for minimizing costs and maximizing utility of services to the taxpayers.

Quick Response codes (QR codes) provide a means to effectively distribute many different varieties of information to the public. We propose to integrate QR code systems and corresponding smartphone applications into existing government services with the goal of providing a new level of interactivity for the public. We illustrate this through two case studies, examining the National Park Services and the Mobile Environmental Information Services (MENVIS). The focus is on developing a QR code waypoint system for park navigation, as well as incentivizing park use through gamification of site attractions. The system provides increased safety for park goers, disseminates information more effectively and accurately, and improves feedback.}

The successful application of VR training system is critical to mine safety and production. Through the statistics of the current research and applications of VR training systems in mining industry, all the input/output devices are classified. Based on the classifications of the input/output devices that are used in the VR system, the current VR training systems for the mining industry could be divided into three types: screen-based general type, projector-based customized type, and head-mounted display (HMD)-based intuitive type. By employing a VR headset, a smartphone and a leap motion device, an HMD-based intuitive type VR training system prototype for drilling in underground mines has been developed. Ten trainees tried both the HMD-based intuitive system and the screen-based general control system to compare the experiences and training effects. The results show that the HMD-based system can give a much better user experience and is easy to use. Three of the five components of a VR training system, namely, the user, the tasks, and software and database should be given more attention in future research. With more available technologies of input and output devices, VR engines, and system software, the VR training system will eventually yield much better training results, and will play a more important role in as a training tool for mine safety.}

However, a large number of issues such as congestion control, safety and security, traffic management exist in modern ITS for which AI-based techniques can be used. From the existing literature, it has been observed that deep learning based techniques are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in ITS which in turns provide unforgettable experience to both the users and drivers. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and their variants are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in modern ITS. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we have reviewed different types of CNN models used in modern ITS for traffic sign recognition, traffic light detection, vehicle classification and pedestrian detection. Various CNN based models and techniques are discussed and compared in comparison to the existing schemes using different performance evaluation metrics. From the in-depth survey provided in this paper, users can identify that which particular model can be used in modern ITS with respect to its merits over the others.}

This priority suggests that stakeholders must understand the possible impacts on their property and assets, and measures they can take to mitigate the risk. Nowadays, flood maps are considered to be a potentially valuable tool for improving this understanding, but some drawbacks related to the use of flood maps for risk communication has been highlighted in the literature. An alternative and novel approach is provided by 3-D representations of flood inundation, so that supplementing flood maps with 3D visualization techniques is increasingly seen as a powerful tool with which to engage people with flood hazards. In this context, the detailed representation of the urban areas is important not only to set an accurate out-of-bank river model, essential for reliable simulations of flow dynamics inside the urban districts, but could be also a key element for the generation of realistic 3D views able to enhance risk perception and communication. In the framework described so far, 3D point cloud data provided by a terrestrial laser scanner could play an interesting role. Therefore, the main novelty introduced by this work is the combination of 2D flood simulations, 3D visual techniques and airborne/terrestrial laser scanning in order to develop new approaches for risk communication and perceptions. The potential of the methods developed here has been discussed in relation to a hypothetical flood event of the Crati river, flowing through the old city of Cosenza (South of Italy).}

abstract = {This work is a systematic review of optimisation methods for pedestrian evacuations. The focus is on interventional approaches that seek to improve evacuation efficiency rather than efforts to purely describe/predict evacuations. Three major evacuation optimisation approaches are identified: (a) architectural design and infrastructure adjustment, (b) mathematical programming and optimisation of path/departure-schedule planning, (c) behavioural modification, training and active instructions. The reviewed literature is dominated by architectural solutions, while the evidence on their effectiveness is largely mixed and inconclusive. They also pose practical challenges: major design interventions in previously-built infrastructure may not always be readily feasible. Furthermore, the effectiveness of architectural solutions is often suggested to be geometry/context dependant rather than universal. Complex path/schedule optimisation solutions also pose their own implementation and enforcement challenges. They often require that an entire crowd be controlled and directed by a central body. They also do not address microscopic aspects of individual behaviour. The behavioural modification method used to be the least studied approach until recently, but it is gaining increasing traction as a promising method in terms of both effectiveness and practicality. Its underexplored potential constitutes a major knowledge gap in evacuation dynamics literature. The first important step to address this gap is to (i) identify possible and most effective areas of behavioural intervention; and (ii) employ reliable experimental or numerical methods to discover optimum strategies, and (iii) determine how behavioural interventions can be effectively conveyed to people. Establishing the relative effectiveness of the three optimisation approaches also constitutes another important question to be explored.}

Pedestrians' head-turning behaviors are crucial to navigating streets safely. This research investigates the effects of phone use on pedestrians' street-crossing behaviors at an uncontrolled intersection where head-turning performances are important to identify a gap among the oncoming traffic. A field study using video cameras was conducted for evaluating pedestrians' head-turning behaviors (e.g., head-turning frequency, not looking at traffic before crossing, looking at the wrong traffic side), crossing time, and sudden movement while they were engaging in various smartphone activities (e.g., calling, texting, gaming, and listening to music). Data such as phone features, distraction types, and personal attributes of the pedestrians were obtained in the interviews conducted after pedestrians had completed crossing the street. The results indicate that the unsafe crossing behaviors (e.g., sudden movement, fewer head-turning frequencies, not looking at traffic before crossing, not looking at left side of traffic first) were more prevalent among those gaming with “Pokemon Go.” Web surfing appears to be the 2nd risky distraction event following gaming with “Pokemon Go.” Logistic regression models reveal several important correlates of unsafe crossing behaviors: being a student, large phone screen (5 in. or larger), and having un-restricted 4G Internet data allowance. The current research recommends that “Pokemon Go” gaming be prohibited while crossing the street.}

Mechanical deformation of human skin provides essential information about human motions, muscle stretching, vocal fold vibration, and heart rates. Monitoring these activities requires the measurement of strains at different levels. Herein, we report a wearable wide-range strain sensor based on conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). A bioinspired bilayer structure was constructed to enable wide-range strain sensing (1%–100%). Besides, hydrogel was chosen as the biological- and mechanical-compatible interface layer with the human skin. Finally, we demonstrated that the strain sensor is capable of monitoring various strain-related activities, including subtle skin deformation (pulse and phonation), mid-level body stretch (swallowing and facial expressions), and substantial joint movement (elbow bending).}

This paper investigates the effects of several smartphone distracting activities (gaming, talking, texting, Web surfing, and listening to music) on the street-crossing behaviours of pedestrians in Taipei City, Taiwan. A field study using video cameras was conducted to observe pedestrian crossing behaviours (e.g., crossing time, sudden movements, running a red light, and walking outside the crosswalk) at a selected signalised intersection. Data such as phone features, distracting activities, and personal attributes of the pedestrians were obtained in interviews conducted after pedestrians had completed crossing the street. In total, 1995 pedestrians engaging in various smartphone activities were observed. Results indicate that unsafe crossing behaviours were more prevalent among those playing “Pokemon Go”. Texting via instant-message apps appeared to be the second-most risk distracting activity. Results of the logistic models reveal that contributing factors to unsafe behaviours include being a student, phone screen of 5 in. or larger, and having an unrestricted 4G Internet data allowance. Two interaction terms (gaming × students, and gaming × unlimited 4G data allowance) in the models appear to be important determinants of unsafe crossing behaviours. The current research suggests that to prevent potential crashes and injuries, smartphone gaming while crossing the street should be prohibited.}

For this it is important that people are properly trained. Faced with the economic, ecological and organizational requirements and constraints linked to fire safety training, virtual training environments appear to be a judicious alternative to traditional training. However, before committing companies to invest in expensive devices, it is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such devices. The literature is rich and divided on this subject, and it appears that certain characteristics of the system and of the learners are decisive. In this context, the objective of our work was to study the effects of immersion, the feeling of presence as well as the interaction between these 2 factors on the performance of conceptual and procedural learning. Certain variables were also controlled such as gender, tendency to immersion, previous experience in computers and video games. Our work shows that immersion promotes procedural but not conceptual learning, and that neither the sense of presence, nor the interaction between immersion and the sense of presence affect these two types of learning in our training task. Apart from the knowledge of fire which potentiates the effect of immersion on procedural learning, the variables considered in our study (computer experience, video game experience and genre) had no impact on performance. Understanding the impact of the technical device or the characteristics of users on conceptual and procedural learning is a major challenge in helping trainers to develop pedagogical devices in order to better exploit the opportunities offered by new technological approaches.}

This phenomenal growth in useable technology and its proportionate decrease in price have benefited the applicability of VR which in turn, have made it more accessible for researchers wishing to harness its benefits. The last 10 years have seen a steady increase in the use of VR technology to restore, preserve, reconstruct, recreate, and visualise ancient sites, monuments and artefacts.

We propose a light and wearable force feedback device that can measure finger motion without calibration and can implement different stiffnesses using a cable slack-based mechanism. The proposed system has a small weight of 298 g, using a 10 g motor. To measure finger motion without calibration, an equation for each finger joint angle is derived from the three-dimensional position and orientation information of the fingertip. To realize different stiffnesses, the proposed system connects a motor and a finger structure with a cable; zero impedance is realized by maintaining a slack. The adjustable cable slack mechanism ensures to restrict the finger motion when the fingertip touches the surface of a virtual object even in fast motion; different stiffnesses are realized by proportional control input to the motor according to the deformation of the virtual object. We manufactured a prototype for three fingers and experimentally verified the performance of the proposed system.}

We observe that in this context delivery workers provide the necessary resilience to the consumer market, yet owing to lack of risk awareness and low wages they may not have incentives to value and manage safety risks properly. We have therefore investigated public and market regulation for possible remedies for this problem. Our research concludes that delivery risks are currently overlooked in EU road transport regulations. Furthermore, the necessary sector transparency that would allow compliance control is equally missing. We have found that the parcel delivery and on-demand delivery sectors also do not provide any special safety measures. The companies do not go beyond recommendations and guidelines and indicate no compliance controls. Some solutions are offered by mandatory contract law, which could provide retailers and consumers with the tools needed to enforce safe delivery in the contract chain. Nevertheless, since there are no explicit contractual obligations, legal uncertainty remains. Our main recommendation is for greater transparency in B2C delivery chains with new or amended regulations, increased reporting obligations and market regulation. All these should be underpinned by optimising digitised data flows in contract chains, which can be achieved by a data pipeline connecting all stakeholders in the delivery chain.}

This paper1 presents HDy Copilot, an application for automatic accident detection integrated with multimodal alert dissemination, via both eCall and IEEE 802.11p (ITS-G5). The proposed accident detection algorithm receives inputs from the vehicle, via ODB-II, and from the smartphone sensors, namely the accelerometer, the magnetometer and the gyroscope. An Android smartphone is used as human machine interface, so that the driver can configure the application, receive road hazard warnings issued by other vehicles in the vicinity and cancel countdown procedures upon false road vehicle crash detection. The HDy Copilot is developed for Android OS as it provides open source APIs that allow access to its hardware resources. The application is implemented, tested and connected to an IEEE 802.11p based prototype. The generated results show that the application successfully detects collisions, rollovers, performs the eCall along with sending Minimum Set of Data (MSD) and Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM).}

First, with a discussion of the recent developments in FL and indoor smart device networks and their integration, we present a thorough assessment of the growing applications of FL in indoor networks. Next, we investigate and evaluate FL’s potential for allowing various indoor applications and services, such as data sharing, localization, navigation, human activity recognition, and security and privacy. FL in numerous critical indoor services and applications, including smart manufacturing, smart homes, and smart healthcare, is then thoroughly discussed. Finally, we conclude this survey by outlining the challenges and potential paths for further study in this rapidly expanding field.}

abstract = {With the increasing complexity of modern buildings, it is becoming more challenging for the professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to effectively digest complex engineering and design information and develop an accurate spatial memory that is critical to their daily tasks. As emerging visualization technologies, such as Virtual Reality, are considered as a promising solution, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanism by which different information visualization methods affect AEC task performance. Cognition literature has discovered a strong relationship between attention and memory development, but little has been done to understand how the visual attention patterns during the design documents review affect the effectiveness of spatial memory in AEC tasks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 63) to test how spatial knowledge is acquired in a building inspection task and how the different visual attention patterns affect the development of spatial memory. Participants were asked to review the design information of a real building on campus. To trigger different attention patterns, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups based on the forms of information given in the review session, including 2D, 3D, and VR groups. After a brief review session, participants were asked to go to the real building to identify discrepancies (based on memory) that were intentionally inserted by the authors. The inspection performance was used to evaluate the spatial memory development. The results indicate that in general there is a positive relationship between test subjects’ visual attention (fixation time) and spatial memory, but the increasing rate varies across the three groups, suggesting that visual context plays a critical role in the development efficiency of spatial memory. The findings also indicate that the visual attention – spatial memory relationship may be mediated by the use of different spatial knowledge acquisition strategies. This study is expected to contribute to the construction information technology literature by setting the cornerstone of a cognition-driven information system that tailors into the spatial cognitive process of AEC professionals.}

Methods: A comprehensive search was undertaken from April 2020 to 22nd January 2021 using multiple electronic databases. A systematic review protocol was developed and published on PROSPERO registration; CRD42020181481. A random-effects model was used to compute pooled estimates of anxiety, depression, PTSD, insomnia and suicidal thoughts. Findings: Our search yielded 11,295 studies and of those 287 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of 206 studies revealed minimal differences in prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among HCPs compared with the public during the pandemic but higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts/ideation or self-harm (11% vs 5.8%) and lower prevalence of wellbeing (28.2% vs 52.6%) among the public compared to HCPs. Interpretation: The pandemic has led to a high mental health burden especially amongst HCPs and higher suicidal ideation and lower wellbeing in general public which warrants further investigation and management globally. These findings highlight an emerging critical public health issue that requires urgent solutions.}

Amongst these are communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks, and audio–video surveillance. Each of these can potentially provide the means for privacy intrusion. De-identification is one of the main approaches to privacy protection in multimedia contents (text, still images, audio and video sequences and their combinations). It is a process for concealing or removing personal identifiers, or replacing them by surrogate personal identifiers in personal information in order to prevent the disclosure and use of data for purposes unrelated to the purpose for which the information was originally obtained. Based on the proposed taxonomy inspired by the Safe Harbour approach, the personal identifiers, i.e., the personal identifiable information, are classified as non-biometric, physiological and behavioural biometric, and soft biometric identifiers. In order to protect the privacy of an individual, all of the above identifiers will have to be de-identified in multimedia content. This paper presents a review of the concepts of privacy and the linkage among privacy, privacy protection, and the methods and technologies designed specifically for privacy protection in multimedia contents. The study provides an overview of de-identification approaches for non-biometric identifiers (text, hairstyle, dressing style, license plates), as well as for the physiological (face, fingerprint, iris, ear), behavioural (voice, gait, gesture) and soft-biometric (body silhouette, gender, age, race, tattoo) identifiers in multimedia documents.}

abstract = {Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

On-bike human–machine interfaces (HMIs) and connecting cyclists to AVs and the road infrastructure may have the potential to enhance the safety of cyclists. This study aimed to identify cyclists’ needs in today’s and future traffic, and explore on-bike HMI functionality and the implications of equipping cyclists with devices to communicate with AVs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 cyclists in Norway and 15 cyclists in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors of cyclist-AV interaction and on-bike HMIs. From the analysis, seven themes were identified: Interaction, Bicycles, Culture, Infrastructure, Legislation, AVs, and HMI. These themes are diverse and overlap with factors grouped in sub-themes. The results indicated that the cyclists prefer segregated future infrastructure, and in mixed urban traffic, they need confirmation of detection by AVs. External on-vehicle or on-bike HMIs might be solutions to fulfil the cyclists’ need for recognition. However, the analysis suggested that cyclists are hesitant about being equipped with devices to communicate with AVs: Responsibility for safety should lie with AV technology rather than with cyclists. A device requirement might become a barrier to cycling, as bicycles are traditionally cheap and simple, and additional costs might deter people from choosing cycling as a transport mode. Future studies should investigate user acceptance of on-bike HMIs among cyclists on a larger scale to test the findings’ generalisability, and explore other, perhaps more viable solutions than on-bike HMIs for enhancing AV-cyclist interaction.}

Concurrently, introducing the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) into 5G to support time-critical applications raises the need to integrate this distributed computing infrastructure to the 5G network slicing framework. Indeed, end-to-end latency guarantees require the end-to-end management of slice resources. For this purpose, after discussing the main gaps in the state-of-the-art with regards to such an objective, we propose a novel slicing architecture that enables the management and orchestration of slice segments that span over all the domains of an end-to-end application service, including the MEC. We also show how this general management architecture can be instantiated into a multi-tenant MEC infrastructure. A preliminary implementation of the proposed architecture focusing on the MEC domain is also provided, together with performance tests to validate the feasibility and efficacy of our design approach.}

From these concepts the key factors determining the added value of forensic investigations are discussed; Evidential Value, Relevance, Quality, Speed and Cost. By unravelling the added value of forensic science and combining this with the future needs and scientific and technological developments, six forensic grand challenges are introduced: i) Molecular Photo-fitting; ii) chemical imaging, profiling and age estimation of finger marks; iii) Advancing Forensic Medicine; iv) Objective Forensic Evaluation; v) the Digital Forensic Service Centre and vi) Real time In-Situ Chemical Identification. Finally, models for forensic innovation are presented that could lead to major international breakthroughs on all these six themes within a five year time span. This could cause a step change in the added value of forensic science and would make forensic investigative methods even more valuable than they already are today.}

abstract = {Background
The relatively decreased time spent in the operating room and overall reduction in cases performed by neurosurgical trainees as a result of duty-hour restrictions demands that the pedagogical content within each surgical encounter be maximized and crafted toward the specific talents and shortcomings of the individual. It is imperative to future generations that the quality of training adapts to the changing administrative infrastructures and compensates for anything that may compromise the technical abilities of trainees. Neurosurgeons in teaching hospitals continue to experiment with various emerging technologies—such as simulators and virtual presence—to supplement and improve surgical training.
Methods
The authors participated in the Google Glass Explorer Program in order to assess the applicability of Google Glass as a tool to enhance the operative education of neurosurgical residents. Google Glass is a type of wearable technology in the form of eyeglasses that employs a high-definition camera and allows the user to interact using voice commands.
Results
Google Glass was able to effectively capture video segments of various lengths for residents to review in a variety of clinical settings within a large, tertiary care university hospital, as well as during a surgical mission to a developing country. The resolution and quality of the video were adequate to review and use as a teaching tool.
Conclusion
While Google Glass harbors the potential to dramatically improve both neurosurgical education and practice in a variety of ways, certain technical drawbacks of the current model limit its effectiveness as a teaching tool.}

In high stakes situations, even the slightest mistake may have tragic consequences; thus, a need exists to equip Warfighters with skills that allow them to recognize/regulate their emotions. Emotional Intelligence (EI) “is the ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions” [1]. Learning effective strategies to manage our emotions is critical for laying a strong foundation for the development of positive relationships [2], [3]. Being able to effectively build positive relationships in diverse settings is a key attribute of cross cultural competence that may be improved through EI training. By practicing emotion recognition/regulation strategies, individuals will begin to replace ineffective decision-making with productive responses to challenging situations. In order to understand how emotions can influence decision making and social judgment, various moderating factors need to be considered, including cultural, group, and individual differences in emotional recognition/regulation [4]. We provide a brief overview of the operational need, define the basic tenets of EI, and describe how this approach could be implemented within an existing military training setting. We describe how emotion recognition and regulation skills would be exercised and evaluated and list potential benefits of using immersive training for skill development. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future research and development in this area.}

The implementation of AI and its inevitable malfunctions are an unprecedented type of crisis for corporate communication professionals. This study reviews (1) 23 instances of AI failures, (2) subsequent corporate communication, and (3) resultant media coverage to investigate the various strategies employed to deal with AI failures. We also identify if these strategies lead to positive or negative responses and/or mitigation of the crisis. Results show that several response strategies included in extant crisis response frameworks can be effective in dealing with AI crises, whereas other strategies tend to be unsuccessful. Our analysis also points to the emergence of a crisis communication strategy that takes advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the accountability of AI to mitigate the crisis.}

abstract = {Since Smart Cyber–Physical Systems (sCPS) are complex and decentralized systems of dynamically cooperating components, architecture-based adaptation is of high importance in their design. In this context, a key challenge is that they typically operate in uncertain environments. Thus, an inherent requirement in sCPS design is the need to deal with the uncertainty of data coming from the environment. Existing approaches often rely on the fact that an adequate model of the environment and/or base probabilities or a prior distribution of data are available. In this paper, we present a specific logic (CB logic), which, based on statistical testing, allows specifying transition guards in architecture-based adaptation without requiring knowledge of the base probabilities or prior knowledge about the data distribution. Applicable in state machines’ transition guards in general, CB logic provides a number of operators over time series that simplify the filtering, resampling, and statistics-backed comparisons of time series, making the application of multiple statistical procedures easy for non-experts. The viability of our approach is illustrated on a running example and a case study demonstrating how CB logic simplifies adaptation triggers. Moreover, a library with a Java and C ++ implementation of CB logic’s key operators is available on GitHub.}

However, in existing literature for human action recognition from a video, there is a lack of synergy in investigating spatial geometry and temporal dynamics in a joint representation and embedding space. In this paper, we propose a dilated Silhouette Convolutional Network (SCN) for action recognition from a monocular video. We model the spatial geometric information of the moving human subject using silhouette boundary curves extracted from each frame of the motion video. The silhouette curves are stacked to form a 3D curve volume along the time axis and resampled to a 3D point cloud as a unified spatio-temporal representation of the video action. With the dilated silhouette convolution, the SCN is able to learn co-occurrence features from low-level geometric shape boundaries and their temporal dynamics jointly, and construct a unified convolutional embedding space, where the spatial and temporal properties are integrated effectively. The geometry-based SCN significantly improves the discrimination of learned features from the shape motions. Experiment results on the JHMDB, HMDB, and UCF101 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed representation and deep learning method.}

Conceptual advances in the study of tourist videography have produced a new model of these practices which is applied here to explain the nature of tourist videography with drones. An international sample of 351 vacation drone videos was subjected to content analysis, and an analysis of their metadata. The results show a significant variation in the content, technological and social practice of production of vacation drone videos depending on the type of video creator and, therefore, empirically validate and expand extant knowledge of drone videography as an emerging visual practice in tourism contexts. The findings establish that analysing the videos from the perspective of videography generates insights that are of value to destination management organizations and tourist businesses. We conclude that destination management organizations should see vacation drone videos as a new type of user-generated content for their destinations, as well as a potential source of innovative marketing ideas, and that they should engage more proactively with vacation drone videographers to maximise the impact of this opportunity.}

At the same time, studies about recessions examine primarily their reasons and consequences. Currently, there is no research examining the role of city technology as a strategic option for firms in a recession environment. To address this gap we develop a conceptual framework from studies of recessions and examine the case study of the IBM Smarter Cities initiative against this framework. Our case builds on interview and archival data. Our study offers two contributions. First, we offer an empirical examination of city technology from the perspective of stakeholders and actors who are tasked with the role to create and disseminate these technologies instead of the perspective of cities that use the technology. Second, we propose a strategic view to city technology and showcase the distinctive theoretical and empirical insights that future studies can develop by shifting the attention on the processes and practices inside the ICT organisations creating and disseminating these city technologies.}

This research study focuses on enhancing the healthcare system using a cognitive-based cloud framework. We employ the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect patient data and utilize a cloud-based cognitive framework for real-time patient monitoring. We aim to achieve cost-effective and high-quality healthcare. Deep learning techniques are applied to assess the health status and obtain experimental results. Specifically, we conduct pathology detection and classification using Electroencephalography (EEG). Multimodal patient health data, including EEG signals, are recorded using an EEG sensor. Intelligent IoT devices transmit the EEG signals from patients to the cloud, where they undergo processing and are forwarded to a cognitive module. The system tracks various sensor readings, such as facial expressions, speech, EEG, movements, and gestures, to determine the patient's condition. To classify the EEG signals as pathological or normal, our proposed method employs a Transfer Learning-based Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods on the same dataset, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95.13% in identifying EEG pathologies.}

However, to deliver the improvements 5G promises, we need to understand how to enhance capacity and coverage, at reasonable cost, across space and over time. In this paper, we take a spatio-temporal simulation modeling approach, using industry-standard engineering models of 5G wireless networks, to test how different infrastructure strategies perform under scenarios of uncertain future demand. We use coupled open-source models to analyze a UK growth corridor, a system-of-cities comprising 7 urban areas, known as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc. We find that population growth has a marginal impact on total demand for 5G (up to 15%), as the main factor driving demand is the increase in per user data consumption resulting mainly from video. Additionally, the results suggest only limited justification for deploying 5G based purely on the need for more capacity. Strategies which reuse existing brownfield Macro Cell sites are enough to meet future demand for Enhanced Mobile Broadband, except in the densest urban areas. While spatio-temporal analysis of infrastructure is common in some sectors (e.g. transport, energy and water), there has been a lack of open analysis of digital infrastructure. This study makes a novel contribution by providing an open and reproducible spatio-temporal assessment of different 5G technologies at a time when 5G is starting to roll-out around the world.}

Remote medical support, commodities transportation within due time, live-action movies, cinematography, distant communication support, and many other provisions are provided by drones right now. However, the selection of drones for a particular job is quite sensitive and not all drones are feasible for any job. In this case, we need to scientifically assess and confirm drone performance in logistics and transportation. In this study, we present a Bayesian Network (BN) approach to predict the overall performance of drone technology through four prime criteria (factors), namely: physical specification, technical responses, functional performance, and economic cost. To that end, we have developed a Bayesian network approach to portray the causal relationships between the various factors that affect drone selection based on their performance, and subsequently, predicted the posterior probability of drone performance conditioned upon the aforementioned salient criteria. To evaluate the model further, a number of analyses, such as Bayesian inference algorithm (belief propagation) and sensitivity analyses have been carried out. The results show that when the physical specification criteria are met, the economic factor is most imperious to the overall performance of the drone, followed by functional performance and technical responsiveness. This research would invoke richer dialogue for the researchers and practitioners to select and use suitable drones and develop subsequent policies for different transportation scenarios under uncertainty.}

This study explores how the perception of government employees shapes the willingness to support the use of AI technologies in government. Based on a survey data on current government employees in the U.S., our analysis reveals that the willingness to implement and use AI technologies in government was contingent upon a series of positive and negative perceptions about the new technologies, long-term outlook on the role of AI technologies in society, and the familiarity and experience in using some form of AI applications in the past. In particular, the perception of AI enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the work and a positive and longer-term outlook on AI's future about human labor (as an assistant or a competitor), the perception of the technology's ultimate harm or benefit (does it harm or benefit humanity), its ability to eventually make ethical and moral judgments influenced the willingness to support AI technologies in government. A substantial proportion of the government employees in the survey sample responded that they had experienced using some form of AI applications in their work and this familiarity had a strong positive influence on their support for AI. Our findings point to the importance of training the government employees in AI technologies to improve their understanding and perception about the new technologies as well as their potentials in government that will foster a culture of innovation toward sustainable and impactful digital transformation.}

abstract = {An integrated urban platform is the essential software infrastructure for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning, operation and maintenance. Today such platforms are mostly designed to handle and analyze large and heterogeneous urban data sets from very different domains. Modeling and optimization functionalities are usually not part of the software concepts. However, such functionalities are considered crucial by the authors to develop transformation scenarios and to optimize smart city operation. An urban platform needs to handle multiple scales in the time and spatial domain, ranging from long term population and land use change to hourly or sub-hourly matching of renewable energy supply and urban energy demand. The paper discusses software architecture concepts for data and modeling urban platforms, which allow to analyze and optimize the urban infrastructure with their energy, water and further resources such as food or goods consumption. Building, commerce and industry as well as the transport sector are in the focus of the efficiency and renewable supply analysis. The main driver is to derive zero carbon strategies for cities while including all major sectors of CO2 generation. So far, two software architecture concepts have been implemented and tested, both using a 3D CityGML geometry data model: A workflow management system for city scale building energy modeling using a monthly energy balance calculation method and a micro service orchestration for dynamic building simulation modeling. The GIS based data analysis methodology and building energy workflow modeling method are applied to a case study district in New York City to demonstrate the implementation status and derive CO2 mitigation strategies. The results showed how data gathered from different sources for the relevant sectors can be translated into CO2-emissions. For a district in Brooklyn connected to a large electric substation with electricity monitoring data available, every individual building´s heating and cooling demand was simulated and resulted in a total annual heating demand of 1.72 TWh/a and 0.11 TWh/a of cooling. It could be shown that the building sector cooling demand can by reduced by 63% by a change of set point temperature for cooling and reduced infiltration rate, while reducing the heat demand by 12%. In addition, carbon accounting of the food and wastewater sector was done using the same GIS based modeling framework. The analysis showed that the food related electricity consumption for refrigeration corresponds to about 5% of the overall electricity consumption and requires 2.6 GWh/a for transport. Using food waste in co-digestion of wastewater treatment plants could contribute another 7.4 GWh/a of combined heat and power. Such quantification of demand and energy sources could contribute to prioritize actions for CO2 mitigation strategies in urban areas.}

Part of the pathway to SHBE is the engagement of robots to manage the ever-complex facilities for tasks such as inspection and disinfection. However, despite the increasing advancements of robot intelligence, it is still “mission impossible” for robots to independently undertake such open-ended problems as facility management, calling for a need to “team up” the robots with humans. Leveraging digital twin's ability to capture real-time data and inform decision-making via dynamic simulation, this study aims to develop a human-robot teaming framework for facility management to achieve sustainability and healthiness in the built environments. A digital twin-enabled prototype system is developed based on the framework. Case studies showed that the framework can safely and efficiently incorporate robotics into facility management tasks (e.g., patrolling, inspection, and cleaning) by allowing humans to plan, oversee, manage, and cooperate with the robot via the digital twin's bi-directional mechanism. The study lays out a high-level framework, under which purposeful efforts can be made to unlock digital twin's full potential in collaborating humans and robots in facility management towards SHBE.}

Specifically, we systematically analyze the knowledge, information and data that can be exploited for maintenance optimization within the Industry 4.0 paradigm. Then, the possible objectives of the optimization are critically discussed, together with the maintenance features to be optimized, such as maintenance periods and degradation thresholds. The main challenges and trends of maintenance optimization are, then, highlighted and the need is identified for methods that do not require a-priori selection of a predefined maintenance strategy, are able to deal with large amounts of heterogeneous data collected from different sources, can properly treat all the uncertainties affecting the behavior of the systems and the environment, and can jointly consider multiple optimization objectives, including the emerging ones related to sustainability and resilience.}

This paper works toward wearable interfaces, through which humans team with multiple drones. We introduce the Virtual Drone Search Game as a first step in creating a mixed reality simulation for humans to practice drone teaming and SAR techniques. Our goals are to (1) evaluate input modalities for the drones, derived from an iterative narrowing of the design space, (2) improve our mixed reality system for designing input modalities and training operators, and (3) collect data on how participants socially experience the virtual drones with which they work. In our study, 17 participants played the game with two input modalities (Gesture condition, Tap condition) in counterbalanced order. Results indicated that participants performed best with the Gesture condition. Participants found the multiple controls challenging, and future studies might include more training of the devices and game. Participants felt like a team with the drones and found them moderately agentic. In our future work, we will extend this testing to a more externally valid mixed reality game.}

abstract = {Transportation infrastructure is a critical component to a nation’s economy, security, and wellbeing. In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure.}

This paper describes the use of digital twins (DTs) and semantic web technologies for the intelligent control of building fire protection (BFP) systems in fire accidents. Specifically, a data fusion stage and several information-based control mechanisms are involved in the use of the two technologies. A designed BFP ontology is considered as the semantic model and basis of data fusion between the static building geometric information and the dynamic sensing data. The above information is incorporated into a DT data model, which is considered as the mapping of physical space. Moreover, rule models and process models are developed to achieve intelligent control mechanisms and keep the DT data model synced with the physical space. A case study based on a fire accident simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of the use of DTs and semantic web technologies.}

abstract = {Rotorcraft are commonly required to fly at low altitudes and this places them at a high risk of striking various types of obstacles. Wires, in particular, are very difficult to discern and easily blend in the background which explains why wire strikes are a major cause of helicopter accidents. In the context of helicopter operations, a wire hazard is any wire or structure supporting those wires that presents a danger to the aircraft. Data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) shows that wire strikes were responsible for 124 fatalities between 1994 and 2018. Data on civil helicopter wire strikes further show that the majority of helicopter models involved fall in the lightweight category. In this study, existing aircraft-mounted and ground-based wire strike prevention and protection technologies are reviewed, along with some other potential technologies that have not been specifically developed for use on helicopters but that might be able to prevent wire strikes. In particular, commercially available wire detection systems such as laser scanning systems, database-dependent warning systems, wire cutters, radar scanners and aerial markers are surveyed and evaluated against each other. Publicly available databases of transmission lines in the U.S. are identified and documented for the development of wire strike prevention technologies for lightweight helicopters. The feasibility of creating useful maps of wires from tabulated data or image data is discussed and various Electronic Flight Bag manufacturers are surveyed and compared to determine the feasibility of integrating and displaying such information in the cockpit. Challenges of implementing safety devices, in particular wire cutters, on lightweight helicopters are also discussed and recommendations are provided to improve helicopter wire strike safety. Finally, a multi-criteria decision-making analysis is carried out to rank wire strike safety devices and compare the robustness of their rankings with respect to various operator's preference scenarios. It is shown that the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), the Wire Strike Protection System (WSPS), the Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS), and the wire markers perform best regardless of the scenario.}

However, research advances are not equally discussed and distributed within Europe. This study puts a focus on the specific geographic location of Southeast Europe (SEE), intending to fill the gap in understanding the research advances in this part of Europe. The aim of this descriptive review was to systematically investigate peer-reviewed publications focused on SC research in SEE in order to present the findings and the state-of-art in this research domain. Seventy-four papers were thoroughly studied, analysed and classified based on their focus on SC themes and common sub-themes. While smart governance had been studied extensively in the SEE region, topics related to the smart economy and smart people received low attention from researchers. Mapping the selected papers to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle showed that SC research in SEE is still in the conceptualising and planning stages, with very little evidence from the real implementation and follow-up activities. From the stakeholders’ perspective, the focus is on the institutional point of view as most of the papers present their findings in relation to (national or local) government bodies or policies, without balancing with corresponding businesses’ or individuals’ (users’) point of view. In general, user involvement was found to be very low in regards to current SC research in the SEE region.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

abstract = {Background
Mobile phone use while driving is a well-recognized area of concern. However, while texting/calling among young adult drivers has received much research attention, more research is needed regarding other phone functions used by young adults while driving.
Study aim
To explore mobile phone functions used by young adult drivers while driving.
Results
An online survey of 17–24 year old drivers (N = 612; 428 females) and focus groups with drivers aged (N = 18; 8 females) revealed that mobile phone use while driving was a very common behavior, with more full licence drivers compared with Learner/Provisional drivers using their phone to make/answer calls, send/read text messages and for internet browsing. This nature of mobile phone use while driving was varied, with phones commonly used for entertainment (e.g., to play music), to connect with others (via texting and/or voice calls) and for navigation.
Concluding remarks
Young adults use a variety of functions on their phone while driving. It is important that young driver-targeted intervention efforts acknowledge that multiple functions of the mobile phone are used during the drive and it serves multiple purposes. Examining the inhibitors and facilitators of mobile phone use and its various functions while driving is needed, in addition to elucidating if the usage of particular mobile phone functions is similar across different driver cohorts.}

Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology which offers exciting prospects for teaching and learning, especially for imparting practical skills. We document here a multidisciplinary experimental study in which a bespoke VR crime scene app was designed and implemented, after which it was tested by both undergraduate student and staff/postgraduate student cohorts. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that VR applications support learning of practical crime scene processing skills. VR-based practical sessions have the potential to add value to forensic science courses, through offering cost-effective practical experience, the ability to work in isolation and in a variety of different scenarios. Both user groups reported high levels of satisfaction with using the app and reports of adverse effects (motion sickness) were minimal. With reference to user feedback, we proceed to evaluate the scalability and development challenges associated with large-scale implementation of VR as an adjunct to forensic science education.}

We chose a turtle as our first host animal and designed a parasitic robot that can perform “operant conditioning”. The parasitic robot, which is attached to the turtle, can induce object-tracking behavior of the turtle toward a Light Emitting Diode (LED) and positively reinforce the behavior through repeated stimulus-response interaction. After training sessions over five weeks, the robot could successfully control the direction of movement of the trained turtles in the waypoint navigation task. This hybrid animal-robot interaction system could provide an alternative solution to some of the limitations of conventional mobile robot systems in various fields, and could also act as a useful interaction system for the behavioral sciences.}

abstract = {Online virtual learning resources have been available for learning and teaching in forensic science for some years now, but the recent global COVID-19 related periods of irregular lockdown have necessitated the rapid development of these for teaching, learning and CPD activities. However, these resources do need to be carefully constructed and grounded in pedagogic theory to be effective. This article details eXtended Reality (XR) learning and teaching environments to facilitate effective online teaching and learning for forensic geoscientists. The first two case studies discussed in this article make use of Thinglink software to produce virtual learning and teaching XR resources through an internet system, which was delivered to undergraduate students in 2021. Case one details a range of XR virtual laboratory-based equipment resources, providing a consistent, reliable and asynchronous learning and teaching experience, whilst the second case study presents an XR virtual learning applied geophysics resource developed for a 12-week CPD training programme. This programme involves recorded equipment video resources, accompanying datasets and worksheets for users to work through. Both case studies were positively received by learners, but there were issues encountered by learners with poor internet connections or computer skills, or who do not engage well with online learning. A third case study showcases an XR educational forensic geoscience eGame that was developed to take the user through a cold case search investigation, from desktop study through to field reconnaissance and multi-staged site investigations. Pedagogic research was undertaken with user questionnaires and interviews, providing evidence that the eGame was an effective learning and teaching tool. eGame users highly rated the eGame and reported that they raised awareness and understanding of the use of geophysics equipment and best practice of forensic geoscience search phased investigations. These types of XR virtual learning digital resources, whilst costly to produce in terms of development time and staff resource, provide a complementary virtual learning experience to in-situ practical sessions, and allow learners to asynchronously familiarise themselves with equipment, environments and techniques resulting in more efficient use of in situ time. The XR resources also allow learners to reinforce learning post in-situ sessions. Finally, XR resources can provide a more inclusive and authentic experience for learners who cannot attend or complete work synchronously.}

Based on the survey results, we have examined the interplay between factors related to digital transformation. The concepts of information literacy and digital literacy related to academic librarianship were used as the basis for the self-efficacy and empowerment necessary to achieve individual success during digital changes in the academic community. We then checked how such a sense of empowerment among academics explains the presence of information culture in this community and different approaches to information management. The factors of information management and information use were presented as affecting a university's institutional readiness for the new requirements of digital transformation from the perspective of governance issues. The findings highlight that information literacy underlies academics' empowerment and a high level of self-efficacy driven by this literacy can also be indirectly translated into the formation of pro-active information culture that strengthens an academic's position in creating information use outcomes and by making them ready for digital transformation. Through information literacy outcomes the academic libraries can turn out to be an important transformative force in terms of digital changes at universities.}

abstract = {During ship emergencies, a reliable and efficient evacuation system is able to guide passengers to the appropriate muster stations as quickly as possible. The majority of the existing indoor evacuation systems provide emergency guidance for people trapped in general buildings. However, those systems fail to consider the unique challenges of ship passenger evacuation, such as the effect of ship motion on pedestrian motion and the feedback of pedestrian motion on ship inclination state. Consequently, evacuation guidance provided by these schemes may not always be optimal or may even make the evacuation worse due to the differences in the critical factors influencing emergency guiding between land-based buildings and passenger ships. This paper presents a systematic literature overview of recent advances in building evacuation, followed by a description of the challenges unique to evacuating passengers on vessels. Furthermore, the existing ship evacuation research is reviewed from three aspects, i.e., passenger behavior study, ship evacuation optimization, and evaluation of evacuation on passenger ships. A discussion of land-based evacuation schemes and prospects for ship evacuation is also presented.}

In the case of flood evacuation, people have to deal with built environments extremely modified by the floodwaters and that hence influences human-environment interactions both from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint. In this sense, the observation of real events is fundamental to define behavioral patterns and their relation to floodwater conditions. To this end, in this work, we analyzed 139 videotapes of recent real-world flood evacuations in outdoor Built Environments involving about 1000 people all over the World (the largest set analyzed so far). The frequencies of behavioral patterns are associated with water depth (measured with respect to ankles, knees, and waist), flow (i.e., still or flowing), and evacuation phase in which they are observed (that is before, during, and after the evacuation). Specific factors like voluntariness, human response, and presence of reference elements in the flooded built environment are also considered. Frequent by-literature behaviors have been considered, and new-noticed ones have been assessed. Results unveil that the most frequent floodwater conditions and thresholds to trigger each behavior concern waters between the ankles and the waist, thus excluding slight and extreme interactions with floodwater. The retrieved behavioral patterns could be employed to develop and validate behavioral models for flood evacuation simulators, and to create critical scenarios for people’s training. Furthermore, they trace quick insights to help safety planners in the design of risk-reduction measures also considering local and/or temporary risks due to the floodwater conditions.}

Many researchers have concentrated on classifying micro-expressions in different discrete emotion classes, while detecting the presence of micro-expression in the video frames is considered as a pre-requisite step in the recognition process. Hence, there is a need to introduce more advanced detection models for micro-expressions. In order to address this, we propose a dual attention network based micro-expression detection architecture called LGAttNet. LGAttNet is one of the first to utilize a dual attention network grouped with 2-dimensional convolutional neural network to perform frame-wise automatic micro-expression detection. This method divides the feature extraction and enhancement task into two different convolutional neural network modules; sparse module and feature enhancement module. One of the key modules in our approach is the attention network which extracts local and global facial features, namely local attention module and global attention module. The attention mechanism adopts the human characteristic of focusing on the specific regions of micro-movements, which enables the LGAttNet to concentrate on particular facial regions along with the full facial features to identify the micro-expressions in the frames. Experiments performed on widely used publicly available databases demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our LGAttNet when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.}

Currently, commercial computer games there are few options of software and sufficiently flexible access devices to meet the needs of this group of children. In this study, a peripheral access device and a 3D computerized game that do not require the actions of dragging, clicking, or activating various keys at the same time were developed. The peripheral access device consists of a webcam and a supervisory system that processes the images. This method provides a field of action that can be adjusted to various types of motor impairments. To analyze the sensitivity of the commands, a virtual course was developed using the scenario of a path of straight lines and curves. A volunteer with good ability in virtual games performed a short training with the virtual course and, after 15min of training, obtained similar results with a standard keyboard and the adapted peripheral device. A 3D game in the Amazon forest was developed using the Blender 3D tool. This free software was used to model the characters and scenarios. To evaluate the usability of the 3D game, the game was tested by 20 volunteers without motor impairments (group A) and 13 volunteers with severe motor limitations of the upper limbs (group B). All the volunteers (group A and B) could easily execute all the actions of the game using the adapted peripheral device. The majority positively evaluated the questions of usability and expressed their satisfaction. The computerized game coupled to the adapted device will offer the option of leisure and learning to people with severe motor impairments who previously lacked this possibility. It also provided equality in this activity to all the users.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) tsunami, public embracement, and the ubiquitous adoption of smart devices are affecting virtually every industry, directly or indirectly. The success of the current and future landscape of IoT and connected devices requires service provision characterized by scalability, ubiquity, reliability, and high-performance, among others. In order to achieve this attribution, the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing (CC), known as cloud IoT, has emerged as a new paradigm providing advanced services specific to aggregating, storing, and processing data generated by IoT. While the convergence of IoT and Cloud brings opportunities, it suffers from specific limitations such as bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The increasing need for supporting interaction between cloud and IoT led to Edge and Fog Computing (FC) in which computing and storage resources are located not only in the cloud but also at the edges near the source of data. The hierarchical and collaborative edge–fog–cloud architecture brings tremendous benefits as it enables us to distribute the intelligence and computation – including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and big data analytics – to achieve an optimal solution while satisfying the given constraints e.g., delay-energy tradeoff. Due to the hierarchical, cross-layer, and distributed nature of this model, achieving an osmotic and effective convergence of IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing requires overcoming many challenges with respect to design and implementation, as well as deployment and evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive insight into the edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm by providing a blend of discussions on all important aspects of the underlying technologies to offer opportunities for more holistic studies and to accelerate knowledge acquisition. To gain a deep understanding of edge–fog–cloud, we will begin this paper by providing an in-depth tutorial and presenting the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, building blocks, components, protocols, applications, and other similar computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Following this, a holistic reference architecture for edge–fog–cloud IoT is presented and the major corresponding design and deployment considerations (e.g., service models, infrastructure design, provisioning, resource allocation, offloading, service migration, performance evaluation, and security concerns) are discussed. Next, we will take a look at the role of privacy-preserving, distributed, and collaborative analytics as well as the interaction between edge, fog, and cloud computing. Finally, we will overview the main challenges in the field of edge–fog–cloud computing that need to be tackled to realize the full potential of IoT.}

Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees’ final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees’ trace data through a visualization tool to pose non-observable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees’ final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.}

As a general-purpose technology, 5G can be configured in numerous ways to support innovative applications across many sectors. Smart network applications and services must integrate physical and virtual components in innovative ways. In addition, general capabilities of 5G must be combined with complementary technologies, such as big data analytics and edge cloud services, to create services for specific use cases. Varying throughput and latency requirements of distinct use cases require differentiated technical solutions. Appropriate frequencies must be aligned efficiently with other features within the footprint of particular, local industrial networks. National policy makers, suppliers, and users are responding differently to these governance and management challenges. These approaches balance differently the trade-offs between experimentation, differentiation, and harmonization. Comparative analysis can inform gradual improvements of the governance of 5G-based, local industrial networks.}

One of the biggest promises of deep neural networks has been the convergence and automation of feature extractors from input raw signals, allowing for the highest possible performance with minimum required domain knowledge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient, end-to-end neural network model for generic, unconstrained text recognition. In our proposed architecture we strive for simplicity and efficiency without sacrificing recognition accuracy. Our proposed architecture is a fully convolutional network without any recurrent connections trained with the CTC loss function. Thus it operates on arbitrary input sizes and produces strings of arbitrary length in a very efficient and parallelizable manner. We show the generality and superiority of our proposed text recognition architecture by achieving state-of-the-art results on seven public benchmark datasets, covering a wide spectrum of text recognition tasks, namely: Handwriting Recognition, CAPTCHA recognition, OCR, License Plate Recognition, and Scene Text Recognition. Our proposed architecture has won the ICFHR2018 Competition on Automated Text Recognition on a READ Dataset.}

abstract = {Background
Simulation-based nursing training has been used incorporated into nursing education for decades, however, there is limited information related to simulation research hotspots and theme trends over time.
Objectives
To investigate the research hotspots and theme trends of simulation in nursing education through bibliometric analysis.
Methods
Relevant articles on simulation in nursing education published between 2005 and 2019 were retrieved from PubMed. The Bibliographic Item Co-occurrence Matrix Builder (BICOMB) was used to extract and quantitatively analyze the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and subheadings. The biclustering analysis was conducted using gCluto1.0 to identify the research hotspots. A strategic diagram was employed to reveal the development trend of the theme.
Results
A total of 4102 publications were retrieved from PubMed showing an overall increasing trend. Based on the results, the United States was the most productive country (2868,55.7 %), the journal Nurse Education Today journal was the top journal concerning this field, and Cooper SJ and Holtschneider ME were authors with the highest number of publications on this topic. Quantitative and co-word biclustering analyses were used in this study. The research hotspots in recent 5 years were focused on: (1) interprofessional simulation in patient-care teams; (2) patient simulation in psychiatric nursing education; (3) virtual reality simulation (VRS) in midwifery and nursing education; (4) simulation in critical care nurses' continuing education/training, and (5) simulation in pediatric resuscitation education. The strategic diagram showed that the VRS in midwifery and nursing education might have a significant potential to become an emerging hotspot soon.
Conclusion
The research literature production of simulation in nursing education was increasing over the past 15 years. Through co-word biclustering analysis, five research hotspots were identified. Among them, simulation in psychiatric education and critical care continuing education had a central priority that researchers should pay further attention to, and VRS could be the major trend for future study. Furthermore, this study described the overall range of research interests and provided ideas for innovative and efficient research projects.}

abstract = {Smart Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is envisaged to provide the capabilities to plan, design, construct, operate and manage Australia's key infrastructure. With over 75% of Australia's population living in cities and accessing public and private goods and services, ICT is positioned as a strategic resource for smart infrastructure developments. In this study, international and domestic stakeholder inputs on the future role of smart ICT in advancing Australia's infrastructure development and operations were crowdsourced for analysis. The study identifies several forms of smart ICT (e.g. building information modelling software) enabled infrastructure that possesses potential to deliver over A$9 billion per annum in domestic economic improvements, with commensurate advancement of communities, regions and urban environments. However, to be effective these smart ICT require enablement through open and interoperable data, sound governance and policy, and government leadership and coordination using dedicated resources. While smart infrastructure development is presently slow and lumbering, the identified smart ICT present as valuable strategic technologies for change and development in domestic communities.}

abstract = {In the state of Florida, climate change and unpredictable weather disasters have put pressure on the state and local decision-makers to adopt swift and efficient Post-Disaster recovery plans. Part of such recovery plans includes rebuilding businesses and housing. However, projects that include the reconstructing and restoring of the damaged buildings are complicated and time-consuming. Throughout the state of Florida, the Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) currently assist with the inspections of existing structures' safety and also issue construction permits for rebuilding or repairing. Regardless of the adaption of various policies and strategies by many governmental entities, innovative methods must be developed to reduce further risks after disasters by creating resilient built environments. This paper seeks to address the issues of Post-Disaster rebuilding. The research presents the significance of adopting a new Virtual Permitting Framework (VPF) to improve the efficiency of obtaining the construction permit in Post-Disaster recovery efforts. The paper explores the current permitting process during Post-Disasters, the impact of the permitting process on the progress of recovery strategies and proposes an innovative system to enhance the rebuilding process using Building Information Modeling (BIM).}

The EST can take the form of a push trolley or of an autonomous mobile platform. The Autonomous EST (AEST) has been designed to provide an integrated solution for automating the creation of complete models. Embedded software performs several functions, including triangulation of the range data, registration of video texture, registration and integration of data acquired from different capture points. Potential applications include facilities management for the construction industry and creating reality models to be used in general areas of virtual reality, for example, virtual studios, virtualised reality for content-related applications (e.g., CD-ROMs), social telepresence, architecture and others. The paper presents the main components of the EST/AEST, and presents some example results obtained from the prototypes.

However, the time-varying communication link environment of signal occlusion and interference between MDs and edge servers often leads to disappointing offloading benefits. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is recognized as a promising technology in sixth-generation communication networks, with great potential to intelligently adjust the phase shift and amplitude of reflective elements to enhance wireless network capabilities. This paper proposes a novel computation offloading algorithm for RIS empowered MEC networks. Specifically, we comprehensively consider the optimization problems of delay, energy consumption, and operator cost in the process of computation offloading, and model it as a Markov decision process. To overcome the continuous action space challenge, we propose a computation offloading algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to jointly optimize the phase shift and amplitude of RIS, offloading decision, and MEC resource allocation strategy. Finally, compared with various other benchmark algorithms, our proposed algorithm has a significant performance improvement over non-RIS learning algorithms and other classical algorithms, and maintains the optimal performance.}

abstract = {With the increase of service years, external walls of high-rise buildings tend to suffer from a variety of defects which impose great safety risks. Traditional methods for inspecting high-rise building external walls require inspectors to work at height and identify defects manually, which is dangerous and inefficient. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for inspecting building external walls, but how to manage the information obtained by the UAV is still a problem. In addition, although building information modelling (BIM) with rich geometric and semantic information has been applied in the construction engineering industry, BIM models usually lack updated condition data of facilities. Therefore, this paper presents a method for managing the inspection results of building external walls by mapping defect data from UAV images to BIM models and modelling defects as BIM objects. First, images of building external walls obtained by UAV are processed and useful information such as coordinates are extracted. Considering the small scale of single buildings, a simplified coordinate transformation approach is developed to transform location of real-world defects to coordinates in the BIM model. Meanwhile, a deep learning-based instance segmentation model is developed to detect defects in the captured images and extract their features. In the end, the identified defects are modelled as new objects with detailed information and mapped to the corresponding location of the related BIM component. To validate the feasibility, the proposed method has been applied to a real office building, which successfully mapped and integrated the defects of external walls with the BIM model. This study is applicable to both buildings and infrastructure, and is expected to facilitate structure inspection and decision making in maintenance with integrated data of as-is condition and as-built BIM.}

However, navigational ease is not always considered when buildings are designed, making wayfinding a difficult and frustrating experience. Moreover, existing solutions are expensive, highly specialized, or both. In this work, we examine how a system of connected low-cost displays designed as an open API can be leveraged to guide users to their destinations quickly, easily, and with minimal cognitive load. Following a formative survey (N=58), we designed: (i) a system of linked, low-fidelity indicators, (ii) a novel map ingestion mechanism for quick and easy deployment, and (iii) a framework for controlling and interacting with an ecosystem of mixed-fidelity devices. We then evaluated our system through a controlled user experiment (N=18) that explores the impact of indicator density and route complexity on performance. Our work shows low-cost embedded indicators can improve indoor navigational experiences by delivering many of the same benefits as more costly solutions, we argue that such indicators would complement existing navigational solutions in a mixed-fidelity ecosystem, and we discuss use-cases as well as design recommendations for deploying similar systems.}

With the substantial increase in the number of egocentric videos, the value and utility of recognizing actions of the wearer in such videos has also thus increased. Unstructured movement of the camera due to natural head motion of the wearer causes sharp changes in the visual field of the egocentric camera causing many standard third person action recognition techniques to perform poorly on such videos. Objects present in the scene and hand gestures of the wearer are the most important cues for first person action recognition but are difficult to segment and recognize in an egocentric video. We propose a novel representation of the first person actions derived from feature trajectories. The features are simple to compute using standard point tracking and do not assume segmentation of hand/objects or recognizing object or hand pose unlike in many previous approaches. We train a bag of words classifier with the proposed features and report a performance improvement of more than 11% on publicly available datasets. Although not designed for the particular case, we show that our technique can also recognize wearer's actions when hands or objects are not visible.}

The participants (n = 30) were asked to complete wayfinding tasks of varying difficulty in a virtual reality (VR) hospital environment. Time segments when participants experienced navigational uncertainty were first identified using a combination of objective measurements (frequency of inputs into the VR controller) and behavioral annotations from two independent observers. Uncertainty time-segments during navigation were ranked on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high). The machine-learning model, a Random Forest classifier implemented using scikit-learn in Python, was used to evaluate common spatial patterns of EEG spectral power across the theta, alpha, and beta bands associated with the researcher-identified uncertainty states. The overall predictive power of the resulting model was 0.70 in terms of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC-AUC). These findings indicate that EEG data can potentially be used as a metric for identifying navigational uncertainty states, which may provide greater rigor and efficiency in studies of human responses to architectural design variables and wayfinding cues.}

Therefore, there is an increased demand for envisioning the 6G wireless communication systems to overcome the major limitations in the existing 5G networks. Moreover, incorporating artificial intelligence in 6G will provide solutions for very complex problems relevant to network optimization. Furthermore, to add further value to the future 6G networks, researchers are investigating new technologies, such as THz and quantum communications.

As vehicles are being electrified, further advances will be needed to meet social, environmental, and economic sustainability targets, and a more efficient use of vehicles and public transport is central in this endeavor. Accordingly, Electric Mobility as a Service (eMaaS) has developed as a concept with the potential to increase sustainability mobility in cities and been designated as a phenomenon with potential to radically change how people move in the future. But presently there is the lack of a common business model that supports complex integration of all actors, digital technologies, and infrastructures involved in the eMaaS business ecosystem. This study aims to support the further development of eMaaS by providing a state of the art of eMaaS and further proposes a digital ecosystem as a business model for eMaaS sharing in smart cities. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was adopted grounded on secondary data from the literature to offers a new approach to urban mobility and demonstrate the suitability of the eMaaS concept in smart communities. The digital ecosystem is designed based on system design approach. Findings from this study provides a sustainable policy perspective, discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development of eMaaS and its impact on electrification of vehicles. Overall, findings from this study considers the role of electric vehicles as part of the mobility sharing economy. Recommendations from this study provides designs and strategies for eMaaS, the interrelations between eMobility and other everyday practices, strategically highlighting the positive benefits of eMaaS and broader policies to limit private car usage in cities.}

They can be utilized as aerial base stations to expand the wireless network coverage, increase capacity and reliability, improve energy efficiency, and provide a higher line of sight (LoS) probability as they work at higher altitudes. The paper bears the question, what if we equipped a BAT with a complete wireless network base station stack and considered it a new beyond fifth generation/sixth generation (B5G/6G) wireless network device? Therefore, this article discusses enabling BATs as new B5G/6G wireless network equipment. We provide the preliminaries that make the BATs suitable for wireless network applications. We propose the expected configuration and architecture for BATs-based B5G/6G wireless networks. We discuss the opportunities, desired applications, and deployment challenges of BATs in B5G/6G wireless networks. Using simulations, we present the evidence and viability of enabling BATs for extending wireless networks.}

This paper evaluates the status and prospects of China's AI innovation ecosystem by developing a Triple Helix framework particularized for this case. Based on an in-depth qualitative study and on interviews with experts, the analysis section summarizes the way in which the AI innovation ecosystem in China is being built, which are the key features of the three spheres of the Triple Helix -governments, industry and academic/research institutions-as well as the dynamic context of the ecosystem through the identification of main aspects related to the flows of skills, knowledge and funding and the interactions among them. Using this approach, the discussion section illustrates the specificities of the AI innovation ecosystem in China, its strengths and its gaps, and which are its prospects. Overall, this revisited ecosystem approach permits the authors to address the complexity of emerging environments of innovation to draw meaningful conclusions which are not possible with mere observation. The results show how a favourable context, the broad adoption rate and the competition for talent and capital among regional-specialized clusters are boosting the advance of AI in China, mainly in the business to customer arena. Finally, the paper highlights the challenges ahead in the current implementation of the ecosystem that will largely determine the potential global leadership of China in this domain.}

The software tool VOSviewer was used to build the keyword co-occurrence network and to cluster the pertinent literature. Results show the significant growth of IoT research in recent years. The most productive authors, journals, and countries were also identified. The main findings from the keyword co-occurrence clustering and an in-depth qualitative analysis indicate that the IoT is used alongside other technologies including cloud computing, big data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and wireless telecommunication networks. The major applications of the IoT for smart cities include smart buildings, transportation, healthcare, smart parking, and smart grids. This review is one of the first attempts to map global IoT research in a smart city context and uses a comprehensive set of articles and bibliometric techniques to provide scholars and practitioners with an overview of what has been studied so far and to identify research gaps at the intersection of the IoT and the smart city.}

In our earlier work, a deep learning framework based on facial action units (AUs) was proposed to emphasize both local and global features to deal with the MaEs and MEs spotting tasks. In this paper, an advanced Concat-CNN model is proposed to not only utilize facial action units (AU) features, which our previous work proved were more effective in detecting MaEs, but also to fuse the optical flow features to improve the detection performance of MEs. The advanced Concat-CNN proposed in this paper not only considers the intra-features correlation of a single frame but also the inter-features correlation between frames. Further, we devise a new adaptive re-labeling method by labeling the emotional frames with distinctive scores. This method takes into account the dynamic changes in expressions to further improve the overall detection performance. Compared with our earlier work and several existing works, the newly proposed deep learning pipeline is able to achieve a better performance in terms of the overall F1-scores: 0.2623 on CAS(ME)2, 0.2839 on CAS(ME)2-cropped, and 0.3241 on SAMM-LV, respectively.}

Consequently, a tremendous data count has been generated with an enormous number of mobile phones due to these applications. This has made remarkable challenges and has a considerable influence on the network slicing performance. This work aims to design an efficient network slicing using a hybrid learning algorithm. Thus, we proposed a model, which involves three main phases: (a) Data collection, (b) Optimal weighted feature extraction (OWFE), and (c) Slicing classification. First, we collected the 5G network slicing dataset, which involves the attributes associated with various network devices like “user device type, duration, packet loss ratio, packet delay budget, bandwidth, delay rate, speed, jitter, and modulation type.” Next, we performed the OWFE, in which a weight function is multiplied with the attribute values to have high scale variation. We optimized this weight function by the hybridization of two meta-heuristic algorithms—glowworm swarm optimization and deer hunting optimization algorithm (DHOA)—and named the proposed model glowworm swarm-based DHOA (GS-DHOA). For the given attributes, we classified the exact network slices like “eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC” for each device by a hybrid classifier using deep belief and neural networks. The weight function of both networks is optimized by the GS-DHOA. The experiment results revealed that the proposed model could influence the provision of accurate 5G network slicing.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}

As an entry-point into this question, it proposes and explores the concept of post-normal engineering.

The second part of the paper offers a comparison of two virtue-oriented approaches, one by Dale Jamieson and the other by Michel Puech, for living well under such conditions. Part Three argues that, under such conditions, virtues of the kind they identify as important to cultivate under these conditions need to be supplemented with virtues of a different, disequilibrating, order, and suggests attuned spontaneity and informal generosity as two examples. A brief conclusion traces some implications of the idea of “disequilibrating” virtue for technological design.}

A large set of possible collapse patterns is generated before the earthquake. After the event, the pattern with geometry most similar to that of the ‘as-damaged’ exterior BIM can be selected rapidly. This paper details the selection methods, which use least sum of point distances and Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) algorithms, and illustrates their operation on a series of simulated computer models of collapsed structures, thus demonstrating the potential feasibility of the proposed approach.}

As the sharing economy strives to recover from pandemic-induced losses, it is crucial to consider factors that might help sharing-economy firms navigate through difficult times. Moreover, value-co creation has been addressed previously in sharing economy research as a unidimensional construct with constrained applicability. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response (S–O-R) framework, the present study focuses on ethical marketing as a strategy for identifying consumer responses—including value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay—that may benefit sharing-economy firms. We have collected the empirical data from n = 403 consumers in the sharing economy. Analyses through structural equation modelling tests reveal that ethical marketing influence value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay. Contrary to our expectations, value co-creation has no influence on consumers' willingness to pay; however, the relationship between value co-creation and consumers' willingness to pay is fully mediated by self–brand connection. Based on empirical results, this study contributes to existing theoretical knowledge regarding ethical marketing and value co-creation literature in the sharing economy and proposes practical implications, including how consumers would be willing to co-create value, establish a self–brand connection, and are more likely to pay in response to ethical marketing.}

abstract = {Research examining whether visuals improve publics’ crisis and disaster information comprehension is scarce despite the increasing popularity of infographics and visual-based social media in public relations practice. One disaster communication platform that is ideal for testing the potential effects of visuals on helping publics protect themselves during disasters is Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs). WEAs are 90-character warnings issued by governments and sent by wireless carriers to individuals (for free) facing an imminent threat such as a tornado or flood. The U.S. government is considering adding maps to future WEAs. Maps are one of the most relied-on tools for people to quickly gain knowledge about spatial tasks such as evacuating during disasters. Consequently, this paper empirically tests how at-risk publics respond to warning messages with and without maps. We do so through two experiments (N1=767, N2=550) of U.S. adults testing three disasters: a tsunami, an active shooter incident, and a radiological disaster.}

The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.}

Meanwhile, the wide range of appearance flexibility results in more similar-looking, confusing images, which is the weakness of the widely used retrieval methods. In this work, we shed light on how to handle these similar images. Specifically, we propose a novel retrieval-verification framework. Given an image, the retrieval module will search for a shot list of similar images quickly. Our proposed verification network will then compare the probe image with these candidate images by contrasting local details for their similarity scores. An innovative ranking strategy is also introduced to achieve a good balance between retrieval and verification results. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our framework and its capability in improving the state-of-the-art methods remarkably on both synthetic and realistic datasets.}

To understand the impact of wayfinding challenges on patient hospital visitation experience, organizational costs, and emerging technology trends that may alleviate wayfinding challenges.
Design
A review of literature on the relationship of wayfinding to patient's hospital visitation experience.
Methods
A literature search identifying issues associated with wayfinding challenges in complex health care facilities was conducted. Case examples are provided to illustrate that the removal of barriers can improve the wayfinding experience. This review also informs technology trends that may effectively facilitate wayfinding in complex health care facilities.
Findings
Large hospital complexes exhibit many characteristics comparable to the physical features of a city environment. These complexities present challenges to patients to navigate to their destinations. An effective wayfinding system is a collection of tools that combines permanent signage, printed information, landmarks, architectural features and design elements, and human interactions. Navigational technology modeling holds the promise to aid patients and individuals with visual and cognitive challenges to find their way to their desired destinations effectively and efficiently, and improves their quality of life.
Conclusions
Improved patient travel time correlates to reduce idled nursing time, with cost savings accrued to organization. Research shows that wayfinding mobile applications hold the promise of improving patients' hospital visitation experience.}

The nature of the walking surface itself also has a strong affect on an appropriate gait. Much work is currently underway in improving humanoid walking gaits by dealing with sloping, debris-filled, or otherwise unstable surfaces. Travel on slippery surfaces such as ice, for example, greatly increases the potential speed of a human, but reduces stability. Humans can compensate for this lack of stability through the adaptation of footwear such as skates, and the development of gaits that allow fast but controlled travel on such footwear. This paper describes the development of a gait to allow a small humanoid robot to propel itself on ice skates across a smooth surface, and includes work with both ice skates and inline skates. The new gait described in this paper relies entirely on motion in the frontal plane to propel the robot, and allows the robot to traverse indoor and outdoor ice surfaces more stably than a classic inverted pendulum-based walking gait when using the same skates. This work is demonstrated using Jennifer, a modified Robotis DARwIn-OP humanoid robot with 20 degrees of freedom.}

It is therefore essential that wireless connectivity can be delivered in a cost-efficient way by Mobile Network Operators, for the benefit of all digital ecosystem actors. The contribution of this paper is to analyse the capacity, coverage and cost of different enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) infrastructure strategies, as the industry moves towards integrating new 5G spectrum bands and densifying existing networks. Both a supply-driven and demand-driven investment analysis is undertaken using a case study of the Netherlands. The supply-driven analysis estimates the capacity that can be provided to users via new spectrum, before network densification via small cells is required. The demand-driven analysis tests a range of required per user speeds including 30, 100 or 300 Mbps and quantifies the performance of investment strategies in meeting this demand. The key contribution is estimating the traffic threshold delivered per user from integrating 5G spectrum bands on the existing Dutch macrocell network. Based on the inputs of this analysis, we find that 5G spectrum bands provide an average per user traffic capacity improvement of approximately 40% for the Netherlands in comparison with the existing LTE capacity.}

The authenticity of the learning experience increases when learning is situated in a context akin to the real world, and realistic learning experiences are created by carefully designing the learning tasks, context, and environment. The fidelity of a learning task's psychological, physical, functional, and social aspects and environment is the design attributes that contribute to the authenticity of the learning experience. The social context, or the social environment during learning, is essential in engaging learners in authentic learning tasks. In this mixed-method study, we investigate whether the collaborative nature of the learning activities, the authentic design of the learning experience and tasks, and the social environment impact the learner's perceptions of their learning experience and confidence in learning transfer. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and then together through triangulation. The findings of this study suggest that learners perceived the tasks and environment as realistic and the learning activities' collaborative aspect as helpful. The authentic learning environment did not significantly impact learners' confidence to transfer. However, the experience led to valuable metacognitive reflection and change in self-efficacy beliefs about their learning and practice needs. This experience may result in better self-regulation in long-term learning. This paper presents the findings of this study and discusses future research implications.}

For this, ubiquitous computing technology is introduced to provide all users with any service, anytime, anywhere, with any device, and under any network. However, high cost, long time consumption, extensive effort, and in some cases irrevocability are the main challenges and difficulties for developing ubiquitous systems. Therefore, one solution is to initially simulate, analyze, and validate practices prior to deploying sensing and computational devices in the real world. Simulation, as a performance evaluation technique, has attracted attentions due to its speed, cost-effectiveness, repeatability, scalability, flexibility, and ease of implementation. Moreover, emulation, as a hybrid method, not only offers most simulation advantages but also benefits from tight control of implementation, as well as a certain degree of realistic results. Both simulators and emulators are significant tools for enhancing the understanding of ubiquitous sensor networks (USNs) through testing and analyzing several scenarios prior to actual sensor placements. In this regard, this paper surveys 130 simulation and emulation environments and frameworks, which were originally designed and adapted for USN. Of these 130, the 22 that have been widely used, regularly updated, and well supported by their developers are compared based on multifarious criteria. Finally, several studies that had favorably compared the performance of simulators and/or emulators are examined. We believe the present research findings will be helpful for students and researchers to pick an appropriate simulator/emulator, and for software developers and those who are keen on producing their own environment.}

In a context of industry lobbying of governments to promote 5G, the paper attempts to bring clarity to just what are the critical issues, specifically for an industrial policy to deal with this novel but complex technology. Planning for 5G is a series of complicated choices as there are issues at the levels of creating ecosystems to support it, unproven business models, with claims for applications which may not be financially viable, yet, plus confusion over choices of radio spectrum, and selection of equipment suppliers, even potential issues over public health, as well as the real level of industrial and consumer demand beyond the hype. The emphasis here is on the importance of making balanced strategic choices, by identifying the basic issues, in a ‘realpolitik’ fashion - including why embrace 5G at all. The paper develops its insights from lessons learnt in the introduction of the previous mobile generation, LTE, also from policy studies on small cells and on designing auctions for 5G networks, as well as various 5G-focused publications from governments, regulatory authorities, mobile industry associations and global suppliers over the past six years (2015–2020). It examines whether to regulate 5G deployment with a heavy or light-touch regime, also whether to focus on more than the traditional indicators, such as penetration and coverage, or on “transformational outcomes” (as the promotional literature terms them) for the private and public sectors.}

To eliminate the redundancy of the traffic video, the magnitude of motion detection based on spatio-temporal interest points (STIP) and the multi-modal linear features combination are presented which splits a video into super frame segments of interests. After that, we select the key frames from these interesting segments of the long videos with the design and detection of the prominent region.

Based on a comprehensive literature review of 796 systematically retrieved articles, the current study proposes a multilayered technology-organisation-environment (TOE-based) risk management framework for sustainable smart city governance. A total of 56 risks are identified and grouped into TOE categories. There are 17 technological risks, including IoT networks, public internet management and user safety concerns, with a 38.7% contribution to smart city governance risks. With a 15.6% share, there are 11 organisational risks, including user data security and cloud management. There are 28 external risks with a contribution of 46.7% to the smart city governance and consist of smart city's environment, governance, integration and security risks. A multilayered TOE-based risk management framework is proposed to identify and manage the risks associated with smart city governance in the current study. The framework links smart citizens to each other through the smart city governance team and the integrated TOE layers. The iterative risk management process of identification, analysis, evaluation, monitoring and response planning is carried out in the TOE layers, both at the external layer levels and internal management levels. The proposed framework operationalises the risk management process for smart city governance by presenting the collection of pertinent risks and their thematic TOE categorisation. The criticality of the identified risks in line with the study's rankings can help researchers and practitioners understand the top risks of smart city governance. These risks present investment opportunities for city governance bodies to develop critical and effective responses as well as provide safety, security and enhanced privacy for citizens.}

To obtain better throughput and enhanced spectral efficiency, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) configuration can be incorporated into MIMO systems, as NOMA uses non-orthogonal resource allocation by assigning the same carrier frequency to multiple devices in the power domain. In this paper, we focus on 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA and cooperative 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA systems for THz spectrum in the downlink transmission. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture, we derive accurate data rate, transmission latency, and reliability expressions for 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA system consists of critical and non-critical devices by leveraging finite block length theory.

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 (I4.0) revolution has led to rapid digital transformation, automation of manufacturing processes and efficient decision-making in business operations. Despite the potential benefits of I4.0 technologies in operations management reported in the extant literature, there has been a paucity of empirical research examining the intention to adopt I4.0 technologies for managing risks. Risk management identifies, assesses, and introduces responses for risks to avert crises. This study combines institutional theory, the resource-based view and the technology acceptance model to develop a novel behavioural model examining the adoption of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and blockchain for risk management from the operations manager's perspective, which has never been examined in the literature. The model was tested for each I4.0 technology using data collected from 117 operations managers in the UK manufacturing industry which were analysed using structural equation modelling. We contribute to the theory on I4.0 in digital manufacturing by showing the impact of digital transformation maturity, market pressure, regulations, and resilience on the perceived usefulness and adoption of these technologies for managing risks in business operations. Based on the findings, we discuss implications for operations managers effectively and efficiently to adopt I4.0 technologies aiming to boost operational productivity.}

abstract = {Developments in hardware and software have led to new innovative methods for visualising geospatial data. At the same time user-centred design (UCD) and usability engineering methods have a fundamental role in designing applications for new technical environments, which involve entirely new ways of interacting. However, applying methods from other research disciplines may not always be straightforward, as the product developers have to operate in a challenging interdisciplinary field. The aim of this study was to find out how usability engineering is currently included in the development of map services. Seven companies developing different types of map applications in Finland were interviewed. The results support the suitability of usability engineering for map application design, since by including the usability approach into the product design, while simultaneously taking into account the individuality and diversity of users and their tasks together with the characteristics of the maps, application developers are more likely to design products that have a higher quality of use. This study identifies the main occasions when the usability approach could be most beneficial. Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of including usability approaches in map application design are discussed. Preliminary ideas on what usability means in the context of map applications are also given. Finally, the importance for providing a basis for the further development of application-specific guidelines and techniques is addressed.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly in the last decade and continues to develop in terms of dimension and complexity, offering a wide range of devices to support a diverse set of applications. With ubiquitous Internet, connected sensors and actuators, networking and communication technology along with artificial intelligence (AI), smart cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide services rendering assistance and convenience to humans in their daily lives. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic has exposed and highlighted the limitations of contemporary technological deployments especially to contain the widespread of this disease. IoT and smart connected technologies together with data-driven applications can play a crucial role not only in the prevention, mitigation, or continuous remote monitoring of patients, but also enable prompt enforcement of guidelines, rules, and administrative orders to contain such future outbreaks. In this paper, we envision an IoT and data-supported connected ecosystem designed for intelligent monitoring, pro-active prevention and control, and mitigation of COVID-19 and similar epidemics. We propose a gamut of synergistic applications and technology systems for various smart infrastructures including E-Health, smart home, supply chain management, transportation, and city, which will work in convergence to develop ‘pandemic-proof’ future smart communities. We also present a generalized cloud-enabled IoT implementation framework along with scientific solutions, which can be adapted and extended to deploy smart connected ecosystem scenarios using widely used Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructures. In addition, we also implement an E-Health RPM use case scenario to demonstrate the need and practicality for smart connected communities. Finally, we highlight challenges and research directions that need thoughtful consideration and across the board cooperation among stakeholders to build resilient communities against future pandemics.}

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a new technology which supports the creation and management of a construction project for buildings. The most well-known open BIM standard, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), provides the detailed 3D geometry and rich spatial semantics. It has drawn growing attention of researchers working in geographical information science (GIS). In many related applications, indoor navigation greatly benefits from IFC since it requires the information about building interiors. IFC provides the semantics and geometry of building, and topological relationships of building elements can be readily derived. These three types of information are extensively used in the research on indoor navigation. In this paper we review the current approaches, applications and solutions developed for different aspects of indoor navigation, and summarize the latest status about the use of IFC-based BIM for indoor navigation. In the literature regarding both IFC and indoor navigation, a total of 87 related papers are identified and categorized. 30 papers relate to the generation of indoor navigation models; 20 papers are about model conversion and data modeling on the basis of the IFC schema; 13 papers refer to IFC applications with dynamic environments; 14 papers focus on the support of IFC to indoor localization; and the other papers involve various topics such as visualization and network queries based on IFC. We find that the most active research direction is to generate navigation models from IFC data, yet there is no robust automation method of the generation. By discussing the pros and cons of the current applications, this paper suggests three new directions for further research on the IFC supports to indoor navigation. That is, researchers can further investigate the vertical dimension of the 3D geometry in IFC, facilitate the transformation from IFC to standardized indoor navigation models and manage real-time data with IFC to reflect indoor changes.}

The findings are based upon a corpus of data including: a field study at the offices of the largest travel user-generated website, TripAdvisor, and a netnographic approach.

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena.}

We anticipate changes in how we interact with our patients and other providers, how patient workflow is designed, the methods used to conduct our teaching sessions, and how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of the present report is to review some of the changes to consider in the clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow and, allow for a smoother transition, with less risk to our patients and healthcare personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and nonclinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for COVID-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and establishing the epidemiologic linkage will be crucial to containing and preventing new COVID-19 cases until a vaccine or an alternate solution is available. Additionally, the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs and personal protective equipment, the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, the increase in overhead costs, and the possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary, must be considered. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths will likely continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or the next 12 to 24 months. Thus, we must prioritize surgery, balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain COVID-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment, and ethical values to continue to deliver high-quality, economical, and accessible patient care.}

In particular, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network, and such cellular-connected UAVs have enabled several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery. Furthermore, the deployment of UAVs in wireless networks as flying base stations (BSs), servers or relays is expected to enhance network performance in terms of coverage, capacity, reliability and energy-efficiency. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential applications and benefits of UAVs is presented. Specifically, UAVs as aerial BSs collecting data from ground sensors, transmitting power to energy-constrained devices and broadcasting information to ground users are explored along with representative design objectives. Then, UAVs as relay nodes for coverage extension, pathloss compensation and interference mitigation are surveyed comprehensively. Besides, UAVs as mobile servers performing edge computing for ground users are introduced, and various aerial offloading modes are reviewed thoroughly. Furthermore, radio and computation resource optimization, as well as mathematical tools and developed algorithms, are described in UAV-assisted communicating, relaying, and computing systems. Finally, open problems and potential research directions pertaining UAV-assisted communications are presented. In a nutshell, this tutorial provides key guidelines on how to design, analyze and optimize UAV-assisted wireless communication systems.}

abstract = {We are living through a convergence of crises. In 2020, when the ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic spread across the world, it brought economic instability in its wake. Sectors of the built environment (BE), among others, were hit hard by a public health crisis followed swiftly by an unprecedented economic downturn. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report highlighted the need for rapid and drastic action on climate change by 2030 to prevent the disastrous effects of a world warmed by more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, raising the urgency of achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by Member States in 2015. Even rapid decarbonisation, the report warned, would likely not be sufficient to address the intertwined problems of poverty, mass migration, politics and ecological collapse that the SDGs seek to address. Digital technology offers an opportunity to better understand and model solutions to these complex crises, but it is unclear how digital technology should be harnessed in the face of an uncertain future. Written at the beginning of this critical decade leading up to 2030, this paper looks ahead 20 years in the future to better understand the resources, technology, economy, governance, infrastructure, mobility and social factors that may shape the development of Britain’s digital BE. By exploring four scenarios around the variables of i) the UK’s compliance with the interconnected targets of the SDGs and ii) the size of the workforce relative to the dependent population (dependency), this paper concludes with the identification of key strategies that can lead to the sustainable development of the BE sectors, outlining a number of actions that should be combined with the path for recovery from Covid-19 and are based on digital technology and a green information economy that ensures a future better for everyone in a digital built Britain.}

This research proposes an information model to facilitate the data flow for post-earthquake assessment of reinforced concrete structures. The schema development was based on typical damage modes and the existing Industry Foundation Class (IFC) schema. Two examples of damaged structures from recent earthquake events, compiled using an experimental damage modeling software, illustrate the use of the data model. The model introduces two new classes, one to represent segments of building elements and the other to model the relationships between segments and cracks. A unique feature is the ability to model the process of damage with a binary tree structure. Methods for exporting as-damaged instance models using IFC are also discussed.}

Those with a pre-existing compromised ocular surface may find that contact lens wear exacerbates ocular disease morbidity. Conversely, contact lenses may have various therapeutic benefits. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impinged upon the lifestyle of contact lens wearers, introducing challenges such as mask-associated dry eye, contact lens discomfort with increased use of digital devices, inadvertent exposure to hand sanitizers, and reduced use of lenses. Wearing contact lenses in challenging environments, such as in the presence of dust and noxious chemicals, or where there is the possibility of ocular trauma (e.g., sport or working with tools) can be problematic, although in some instances lenses can be protective. Contact lenses can be worn for sport, theatre, at high altitude, driving at night, in the military and in space, and special considerations are required when prescribing in such situations to ensure successful outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis, incorporated within the review, identified that the influence of lifestyle factors on soft contact lens dropout remains poorly understood, and is an area in need of further research. Overall, this report investigated lifestyle-related choices made by clinicians and contact lens wearers and discovered that when appropriate lifestyle choices are made, contact lens wear can enhance the quality of life of wearers.}

abstract = {Several manual-handling works (e.g. load-lifting, carrying, carpet-laying, etc.) involve repetitive lower limb movements (RLLM) such as squatting, kneeling, or walking which are notable risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the lower-limb and lumbar spine. Wearable exoskeletons can augment workers’ strength and minimize muscular activation in RLLM, thus enhancing efficiency and improving workers health. In this paper, we present the design and control of a wearable lower-body exoskeleton to assist RLLM. The design of the exoskeleton is anthropomorphic with six-degrees of freedom (6-DoF) on each leg: 1-active and 1-passive DoF on the hip-joint, 1-active and 1-passive DoF on the knee-joint, and 2-passive DoFs on the ankle-joint. The active DoFs are actuated by bi-directional brushless DC motors to permit sagittal movements. The exoskeleton controller is designed hierarchical with a low-level linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) torque controller, a middle-level user-input torque estimator based on dual extended Kalman filter (EKF), and a novel high-level supervisory algorithm for movement detection and synchronization of the exoskeleton with the user. Initial evaluation of the prototype is conducted on five healthy participants recruited to perform repetitive load-lifting and carrying manual-handling tasks. Electromyogram sensors are placed at the participants’ right Vastus Intermedius and right Gastrocnemius to extract muscle activity signals. Results show that the exoskeleton could provide torque assistance by amplifying participants’ input joint torques and could minimize muscular activation in the two muscles by more than 36% respectively in all movement tasks.}

However, most evaluation techniques described in literature do not address the complexity and range of the issues which underpin the design of a good evaluation methodology. In this paper, we explore the problems associated with both the optimising the operating point of any motion detection algorithms and the objective performance comparison of competing algorithms. In particular, we develop an object-based approach based on the F-Measure—a single-valued ROC-like measure which enables a straight-forward mechanism for both optimising and comparing motion detection algorithms. Despite the advantages over pixel-based ROC approaches, a number of important issues associated with parameterising the evaluation algorithm need to be addressed. The approach is illustrated by a comparison of three motion detection algorithms including the well-known Stauffer and Grimson algorithm, based on results obtained on two datasets.}

abstract = {While natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, and earthquakes are inevitable, improving existing emergency response approaches and technology becomes critical in today’s smart city development. That is, ensuring evacuees get a fast and effective evacuation route plays a very important role in increasing survival rate and reducing damage during emergency or disaster situations for smart cities. In this research, we investigate the design and development of efficient evacuation routes. By considering the realistic response to emergency evacuations, we present a model based on the number of incoming vehicles in different periods of time. In this paper, we propose a Queueing-based Recommendation system (Q-Recomm) for dynamic route recommendations for evacuees to use at the time of a disaster. Compared with other existing studies that use static conditions, our proposed algorithms consider dynamic road conditions by using queueing theory and graph theory. Specifically, we first characterize the evacuation network of a disaster as a directed acyclic graph and then exploit an MMPP/M/1/N queueing model to derive the optimal route in terms of the minimum driving time by analyzing road congestion, vehicle wait time, and road capacity as well as vehicle arrival rates for chosen routes, using high-end sensors for dynamic data acquisition. We propose the Queueing-based Time Constrained Route Recommendation (Q-TCRR) algorithm and the Queueing-based Minimum Driving Time Route Recommendation (Q-MDTRR) algorithm for route recommendation in evacuation networks. Our experimental results validate the accuracy of Q-TCRR and Q-MDTRR, respectively, and we also demonstrate that the Q-MDTRR algorithm has a lower driving time compared with both MacroServ and the shortest path route based on Dijkstra. Thus, while edge computing in vehicular ad hoc networks becomes a promising solution for evacuation networks, our two proposed algorithms can be flexibly realized in edge computing in vehicular ad hoc networks due to their computational efficiency.}

What is Russia's strategy for boosting development of AI technologies, and what role do groups within the Russian elite play in shaping this strategy? Russia's AI development strategy is unique in that it is led not by the government, nor by the private sector, but by state-owned firms. The government's distrust of Russia's largest tech firm, Yandex, has sidelined the company from national AI planning. Meanwhile, Russia's defense conglomerate Rostec publicly appears to focus less on artificial intelligence than on other high-tech priorities. As a result, Russia's AI development has been left to a state-owned bank, Sberbank, which has taken the lead in devising plans for government-backed investment in AI.}

Sustainability can be analyzed through four dimensions: the economic issue captured by productivity growth and export value growth, the social issue captured by employment growth, and the environmental issue captured by the sustainable nitrogen management index. Digital businesses are captured by four elements of e-Commerce (e-Commerce sales, e-Commerce web sales, e-Commerce turnover, and online selling) and two estimations of e-Business (Cloud usage and customer relation management (CRM) usage). Digital public services are reflected by user-centricity, business mobility, and key enablers. It is the first to prove the existence of a nonlinear relationship between digitalization and sustainable agriculture. We apply various econometric techniques, including the panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) model, feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimation, and two-step generalized method of moment (two-step GMM) model, to a database of 24 countries in the European Union between 2011 and 2019. The results point to the importance of digitalization in improving the agriculture sector's productivity, export activities, employment, and environmental sustainability. However, these impacts of digitalization on each dimension of the agriculture sector's sustainability are nonlinear in the shape of a U-curve, suggesting that the favorable effects only appear when the development of digitalization reaches a certain threshold. Our findings suggest critical policy implications for the promotion of digitalization as a tool to pursue smart and sustainable agriculture. It is crucial for policymakers to control the digitalization process and intervene, as digitalization, as much as it is innovative, can be detrimental to ethical, political, social, or cultural values.}

In general, ITS aims at ensuring better traffic efficiency and reducing road accidents. However, due to different limitations and issues, these systems suffer from different security and privacy vulnerabilities. In fact, they are both vulnerable to various types of security and privacy attacks that may result in life-endangering situations. As a result, several solutions were presented to achieve the required levels of security and confidentiality. In this paper, an overview of ITS is presented stating the reasons behind the evolution from Vanet to IoV. Then, the main threats/attacks that threaten ITS are classified according to their (1) security impact and according to the (2) network layer(s) they affect. Solutions for each attack are also well presented. In addition, a security and performance evaluation and summary tables are presented to provide an overview of these surveyed solutions.}

Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deemed a promising solution to settle the conflict between the resource-hungry mobile applications and the resource-constrained IoT users. On the other hand, in order to provide ubiquitous and reliable connectivity in wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be leveraged as efficient aerial platforms by exploiting their inherent attributes, such as the on-demand deployment, high cruising altitude, and controllable maneuverability in three-dimensional (3D) space. Thus, the UAV-enabled aerial MEC is believed as a win-win solution to facilitate cost-effective and energy-saving communication and computation services in various environments. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the UAV-enabled aerial MEC. Firstly, the related advantages and research challenges for aerial MEC are discussed. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent research advances, which is categorized by different domains, including the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, computation offloading and resource allocation, UAV deployment, task scheduling and load balancing, interplay between aerial MEC and other technologies, as well as the machine-learning (ML)-driven optimization.

In this article, we present a brief planar overview of a smart city system architecture by introducing the application, sensing, communication, data, and security/privacy planes. Tailoring existing communication protocols and infrastructures to bridge massively deployed sensors and data processing/storage resources introduces unique communication challenges for smart cities. Furthermore, co-existence, integration, and control of dedicated and non-dedicated sensors is a grand challenge while IoT sensors continuously push sensory data through the communication medium towards data processing and analysis planes. While pervasiveness and ubiquity of smart city services are ensured by the interaction of communication and sensing technologies, their robustness and resilience call for customized security and privacy solutions. With these in mind, we focus on sensing/actuation, communication, and security planes of a smart city system and present a comprehensive survey of the challenges and state-of-the-art solutions in each plane. Furthermore, we provide insights for open issues and opportunities in these planes.}

In this study, we question this argument and provide empirical evidence by conducting a survey that links media channels’ affordances to their capability to carry organizations’ dialogic orientations. Results show that bandwidth and social presence affordances facilitate dialogic communication while anonymity slightly inhibits it, whether the communicative context is proactive or reactive. Social presence exerts the greatest impact on how publics perceive organizations’ dialogic orientations, and anonymity’s negative role was overstated by previous studies. Assessing media channels’ dialogic affordances, we found video conferencing and instant messaging to be the most dialogic channels for mediated organization-public communication.}

abstract = {Smart Cities initiatives are spreading all around the globe at a phenomenal pace. Their bold ambition is to increase the competitiveness of local communities through innovation while increasing the quality of life for its citizens through better public services and a cleaner environment. Prior research has shown contrasting views and a multitude of dimensions and approaches to look at this phenomenon. In spite of the fact that this can stimulate the debate, it lacks a systematic assessment and an integrative view. The papers in the special issue on “Understanding Smart Cities: Innovation Ecosystems, Technological Advancements, and Societal Challenges” take stock of past work and provide new insights through the lenses of a hybrid framework. Moving from these premises, we offer an overview of the topic by featuring possible linkages and thematic clusters. Then, we sketch a novel research agenda for scholars, practitioners, and policy makers who wish to engage in – and build – a critical, constructive, and conducive discourse on Smart Cities.}

Since then, deep learning technique, characterized by the hierarchical architecture to stitch together pixels into invariant face representation, has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art performance and fostered successful real-world applications. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent developments on deep FR, covering broad topics on algorithm designs, databases, protocols, and application scenes. First, we summarize different network architectures and loss functions proposed in the rapid evolution of the deep FR methods. Second, the related face processing methods are categorized into two classes: “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”. Then, we summarize and compare the commonly used databases for both model training and evaluation. Third, we review miscellaneous scenes in deep FR, such as cross-factor, heterogenous, multiple-media and industrial scenes. Finally, the technical challenges and several promising directions are highlighted.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things needs for computing power and storage are expected to remain on the rise in the next decade. Consequently, the amount of data generated by devices at the edge of the network will also grow. While cloud computing has been an established and effective way of acquiring computation and storage as a service to many applications, it may not be suitable to handle the myriad of data from IoT devices and fulfill largely heterogeneous application requirements. Fog computing has been developed to lie between IoT and the cloud, providing a hierarchy of computing power that can collect, aggregate, and process data from/to IoT devices. Combining fog and cloud may reduce data transfers and communication bottlenecks to the cloud and also contribute to reduced latencies, as fog computing resources exist closer to the edge. This paper examines this IoT-Fog-Cloud ecosystem and provides a literature review from different facets of it: how it can be organized, how management is being addressed, and how applications can benefit from it. Lastly, we present challenging issues yet to be addressed in IoT-Fog-Cloud infrastructures.}

The industry and the academia are embracing 5G as the future network capable to support next generation vertical applications with different service requirements. To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.). Softwarization using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)in 5G networks are expected to fill the void of programmable control and management of network resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and updated solutions related to 5G network slicing using SDN and NFV. Firstly, we present 5G service quality and business requirements followed by a description of 5G network softwarization and slicing paradigms including essential concepts, history and different use cases. Secondly, we provide a tutorial of 5G network slicing technology enablers including SDN, NFV, MEC, cloud/Fog computing, network hypervisors, virtual machines & containers. Thidly, we comprehensively survey different industrial initiatives and projects that are pushing forward the adoption of SDN and NFV in accelerating 5G network slicing. A comparison of various 5G architectural approaches in terms of practical implementations, technology adoptions and deployment strategies is presented. Moreover, we provide a discussion on various open source orchestrators and proof of concepts representing industrial contribution. The work also investigates the standardization efforts in 5G networks regarding network slicing and softwarization. Additionally, the article presents the management and orchestration of network slices in a single domain followed by a comprehensive survey of management and orchestration approaches in 5G network slicing across multiple domains while supporting multiple tenants.

A number of different computational methods were trialed to detect spikes in tension using a human coded sample of data collected from Twitter, relating to an accusation of racial abuse during a Premier League football match. Conversation analysis combined with syntactic and lexicon-based text mining rules; sentiment analysis; and machine learning methods was tested as a possible approach. Results indicate that a combination of conversation analysis methods and text mining outperforms a number of machine learning approaches and a sentiment analysis tool at classifying tension levels in individual tweets.}

This paper aims to lay the foundations for a more realistic representation of human factors in evacuation models, which is needed to ensure the adequacy of the infrastructure, decision processes and safety of evacuation. To provide a clearer picture of the empirical knowledge and modelling for evacuation studies, a generalized timeline is introduced. Recent behavioral evidence from empirical studies in the fields of both pedestrian evacuation and vehicular evacuations are reviewed to investigate the impact of various factors on the evacuee behavior over different phases. The consensus perspective on key behaviors that emerges is then used to review and consolidate the recent advances in evacuation modelling, in particular with respect to the formulations and techniques for representing these behaviors. Within each of these discussions, we pointed to current limitations and make corresponding suggestions on future research directions.}

For information systems (IS) the domain of semiosis consists of human and non-human interactions based on technologically-mediated communication in the social, material and personal worlds. The paper argues that semiosis has immense bearing on processes of communication central to the advanced information and communications technologies studied by IS scholars. Its use separately, or in mixed methods approaches, enriches areas of central concern to the IS field, and is particularly apt when researching internet-based development and applications, for example virtual worlds and social media. This paper presents a four step structured methodology, informed by a central theoretical semiotic framework to provide practical guidelines for operationalizing semiotics in IS research. Thus, using illustrative examples, the paper provides a step-by-step semiotics approach to research based on distinctive semiotic concepts and their relationships – producer, consumer, medium, code, message and content – and how, at an integrating level, the personal, social and material worlds relate through sociation, embodiment and socio-materiality.}

abstract = {Serious games present a relatively new approach to training and education for international organizations such as NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and MOOCs may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.}

In this context, marine robotics has steadily emerged as a key enabling technology for the execution of increasingly complex and challenging missions at sea. Intensive research and development in this field have led to major advances and shown unequivocally the effectiveness and reliability of marine robotics solutions in several domains. This progress goes hand in hand with the availability of increasingly sophisticated acoustic networks for multiple, cooperative missions involving surface and underwater robots. At the root of this trend is the fruitful dialogue between robotic systems developers and end-users with the capacity to convert general mission objectives into functional and technical specifications that serve as application-driven requirements for engineering development. The result is the tremendous progress observed in the consolidated methodologies and procedures adopted and the consequent impact on science, industry, and the society at large. In spite of the progress in the area, however many challenges must still be faced and novel applications will continue to set further requirements for future generations of marine robots and their enabling systems. The time is therefore appropriate to overview recent trends in the field of marine robotics and assess their impact on several important application domains. With these objectives in mind, in the present paper we highlight key technological achievements in the field, analyze some of the shortcomings encountered, and indicate specific issues that warrant further research and development effort. To this end, we review a number of highly representative projects in the field, with due account for the theoretical frameworks upon which technological developments build upon. Finally, the paper concludes with an outlook on the future of marine robotics, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, and describes recently initiated projects that hold promise for the development of advanced tools and systems for ocean exploration and exploitation.}

Recently, the wide availability of embedded wireless interfaces in the communicating entities has allowed the deployment of such a paradigm simpler and easiest. Moreover, due to UAVs' controlled mobility and adjustable altitudes, they can be considered as the most appropriate candidate to enhance the performance and overcome the restrictions of ground networks. This comprehensive survey both studies and summarizes the existing UAV-assisted research, such as routing, data gathering, cellular communications, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and disaster management that supports existing enabling technologies. Descriptions, classifications, and comparative studies related to different UAV-assisted proposals are presented throughout the paper.

While it is widely known what cloud computing is, how data centers can build the cloud infrastructure and how applications can make use of this infrastructure, there is no common picture on what fog computing and particularly a fog node, as its main building block, really is. One of the first attempts to define a fog node was made by Cisco, qualifying a fog computing system as a “mini-cloud” located at the edge of the network and implemented through a variety of edge devices, interconnected by a variety, mostly wireless, communication technologies. Thus, a fog node would be the infrastructure implementing the said mini-cloud. Other proposals have their own definition of what a fog node is, usually in relation to a specific edge device, a specific use case or an application. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art in technologies for fog computing nodes, paying special attention to the contributions that analyze the role edge devices play in the fog node definition. We summarize and compare the concepts, lessons learned from their implementation, and end up showing how a conceptual framework is emerging towards a unifying fog node definition. We focus on core functionalities of a fog node as well as in the accompanying opportunities and challenges towards their practical realization in the near future.}

abstract = {Cloud computing is changing the traditional ways of computing using its different forms and architectural types such as Edge and Fog computing. These computing frameworks are the extensions of the basic cloud computing model and promise to offer improved network performance. The trio of these technologies forms a new domain called Edge–Fog–Cloud environment and is consistently being explored by researchers across the world. Numerous industrial applications use cloud resources and its services to avail the related benefits. Most of these industrial applications use a large number of power-sensitive devices that generate a huge volume of data. This data is termed as Industrial IoT (IIoT) data, and includes multi-dimensional information in its pool. This voluminous data pool need to be analyzed carefully to offer deep rooted insights that may help rejuvenate the system and boost its performance. This paper provides detailed coverage of the Edge–Fog–Cloud-based architectural frameworks, compares their pros and cons, and explores the scientific side of the multi-dimensional IIoT data. In addition to this, the current state-of-the-art and respective implementation challenges are also highlighted.}

abstract = {This paper argues, following Friedrich Nietzsche, that recent evaluations of Google Earth uncritically privilege the product’s Apollonian determinations at the expense of its Dionysian uncertainties. Specifically, when we understand Google Earth as a virtual globe composed of surveyed panoramas, sober rationalization, dystopic control, and transparent order – or, even, as a tool for participation and empowerment – we undersell its capacities as an alluring digital peep-box, an uncertain orb spangled with vertiginous paranoia, frenzied navigation, jubilatory dissolution, and intoxicating giddiness. We argue that the former interpretations not only risk foreclosing our theorizations about how Google Earth is actually used in various ways and different contexts, they also reproduce a one-dimensional and conservative reading of technology that can be traced back (at least) to the writings of Theodor Adorno. By drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin (Adorno’s critic and pen pal for more than a decade) we aim to ‘go beyond Apollo and Adorno’ by illustrating the extent to which Apollonian order and Dionysian love makes Google Earth go round. To do this, we examine Google Earth as a “digital peep-box” with an online collective that revels in its “Spot the Black Helicopter” competitions; illuminated profanities; alien and giant insect invaders; naked sunbathers; and crashed transport planes in Darfur.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) allows communication between devices, things, and any digital assets that send and receive data over a network without requiring interaction with a human. The main characteristic of IoT is the enormous quantity of data created by end-user’s devices that needs to be processed in a short time in the cloud. The current cloud-computing concept is not efficient to analyze very large data in a very short time and satisfy the users’ requirements. Analyzing the enormous quantity of data by the cloud will take a lot of time, which affects the quality of service (QoS) and negatively influences the IoT applications and the overall network performance. To overcome such challenges, a new architecture called edge computing — that allows to decentralize the process of data from the cloud to the network edge has been proposed to solve the problems occurred by using the cloud computing approach. Furthermore, edge computing supports IoT applications that require a short response time and consequently enhances the consumption of energy, resource utilization, etc. Motivated by the extensive research efforts in the edge computing and IoT applications, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of edge and fog computing research in the IoT. We investigate the role of cloud, fog, and edge computing in the IoT environment. Subsequently, we cover in detail, different IoT use cases with edge and fog computing, the task scheduling in edge computing, the merger of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) with edge computing, security and privacy efforts. Furthermore, the Blockchain in edge computing. Finally, we identify open research challenges and highlight future research directions.}

In order to address this issue, and to increase the accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the health-care domain, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) was proposed. IoMT can be considered as an enhancement and investment to respond more effectively and efficiently to patients’ needs. However, IoMT suffers from different issues and challenges such as the lack of security and privacy measures, in addition to the necessary training and awareness. In this paper, we highlight the importance of implementing the right security measures and the required training skills, in order to enhance the immunity of IoMT against cyber-attacks. Moreover, we review the main IoMT security and privacy issues, and the existing security solutions. These solutions are classified as cryptographic or non-cryptographic. Then, the different solutions are analyzed and compared in terms of computational complexity and required resources. It is important to note that the security measures for IoMT exhibit a trade-off between the security level and the system performance, especially in the rise of digital healthcare v4.0 era. Next, we discuss the appropriate security solutions such as lightweight cryptographic algorithms, and protocols that attempt to reduce the overhead in terms of computations and resources. This leads to the conclusion that there is a need to design an efficient intrusion detection/prevention system that cooperates with dynamic shadow honeypots. Finally, we propose a security solution, which is divided into five different layers to detect and prevent attacks, in addition to reducing/correcting the damage of these known attacks and preserving the patients’ privacy. However, it should be noted that zero-day attacks and exploits are still the main challenging issue that surrounds IoMT.}

Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.}

abstract = {Humans more and more live in urban areas and spend the majority of their time indoors, while buildings are becoming increasingly interconnected. Path planning in complex indoor environments is consequently becoming a societal challenge. This paper proposes a system, called BiMov, dedicated to automatically determining plan paths in complex buildings based on a digital mock-up (a BIM in IFC format). The originality of the research comes from the separation of the BIM model topological analysis from the semantic and geometric consideration of the customer of the path planning service. The process consists in exploiting the semantic, geometric, and topological features of the constituents of a BIM to generate navigation graphs that take the profile of MOoP (Mobile Object or Person) and the operational accessibility status of spaces and transitions (such as doors or stairs) into account. The ultimate aim is to determine the optimal path according to given criteria. The system is based on four data models: (1) a building model derived from the original BIM that represents and structures the building features relevant to indoor mobility; (2) a MOoP model representing its bulk size, ability to move horizontally and vertically, and various authorisations; (3) a calendar model representing the conjectural accessibility status of spaces and transitions; (4) a navigation graph model proposing three levels of detail. The Macro level represents a simple graph of connectivity between neighbouring interior spaces and is intended to help architects verify their design in terms of accessibility. The External level is used to connect accessible spaces via their common horizontal or vertical transitions. This level is intended for MOoPs that do not require a detailed description of the path. The Internal level integrates meshing of each space: a 2D mesh for planar mobility or a 3D mesh for drones. This level is intended for MOoP such as heavy object handlers or autonomous mobile vehicles that need to validate a reliable path within spaces containing furniture, hazardous machinery, or bulky equipment. We developed a prototype software application that illustrates our approach for different path planning scenarios in a BIM model generated outside this project.}

abstract = {Naval platform survivability is a key enabler to ensure maritime warfighting capability. Therefore, assessment of naval platform recoverability, after a damage event, is critical to assure platform survivability in a warfighting environment. To support such an assessment, an innovative modelling and simulation capability, known as the Naval Damage Incident Recoverability Toolset (NavDIRecT) is being developed. NavDIRecT is being designed as a component-based, open architecture providing the necessary framework to allow analysts to integrate domain models of their choosing. NavDIRecT will facilitate analysis of warfighting and peacetime damage events using a variety of mathematical models, thereby avoiding the limitations of other survivability assessment techniques. Development of NavDIRecT is exemplified by integrating the human movement simulator, maritimeEXODUS, the fire simulation environment, SMARTFIRE, and a three-dimensional naval platform model. NavDIRecT will enable analysis of crew interaction with damage events, thereby allowing acquisition programs and mission planners to examine platform survivability with respect to mission capability requirements. The impetus for NavDIRecT development is for assessment of naval platform survivability and mission success; however, the tools and techniques are equally suitable for use in incident management, training, and analysis of merchant and commercial shipping in accordance with the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).}

By 2030, a 50% rise in lighting demand of the existing consumption is projected due to an increase in the global population. To address the concern of rising lighting electricity consumption, the key strategy is to develop and provide energy efficient lighting products to consumers. In this respect, the Solid-State Lighting (SSL) has the potential to offer power efficiencies that are superior to those of conventional lighting sources. Recently, white organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have emerged as the leading technology for the new display and lighting market which has attracted substantial attention of manufacturers, product designers, and end users. OLED devices have already entered into high end lighting markets such as designer, automotive, aerospace, high-end architectural lighting, and other applications. Moreover, innovative flexible OLED devices are thought to be candidates for the next-generation SSL systems, wearable electronics, mobile devices, microdisplays, etc. as they are lighter, thinner and more durable compared to glass (rigid) based devices. In the present review, distinctive features of OLEDs SSL lighting, technical requirements of lighting for applications, OLED basic, and classification of OLED devices, including quantum dot (QD) OLEDs (QLED) as well as the need of development of OLEDs standards are discussed. Various constituents of flexible OLED lighting, OLED lighting panels by some manufacturers, hurdles in OLED lighting technologies, performance of OLEDs in harsh conditions, challenges in flexible OLEDs, OLED lighting technology comparison, OLED lighting roadmap, and future directions including cost reduction analysis, flexible OLED incorporated into automotive, IoT (Internet of Things) connected lighting system, OLED market projections, etc. are also presented. It is suggested that the white OLEDs, and flexible OLEDs in particular, lighting products have potential to revolutionize the future of lighting systems, industries, and the market.}

Since the development of such policies is challenging, there is a need to learn from the experience of many cities around the world offering efficient and successfully adopted smart mobility services. However, in practice, the information provided about such initiatives is shallow and unstructured. To address this issue, we study the state of the art in mobility services, reviewing scientific publications and 42 smart mobility services delivered by nine smart cities around the world, and we propose a taxonomy for planning and designing smart mobility services. The taxonomy provides a common vocabulary to discuss and share information about such services. It comprises eight dimensions: type of services, maturity level, users, applied technologies, delivery channels, benefits, beneficiaries, and common functionality. The contribution of the proposed taxonomy is to serve as a tool for guiding policy makers by identifying a spectrum of mobility services that can be provided, to whom, what technologies can be used to deliver them, and what is the delivered public value so to justify their implementation. In addition, the taxonomy can also assist researchers in further developing the domain. By identifying common functionality, it could also help Information Technology (IT) teams in building and maintaining smart mobility services. Finally, we further discuss usage scenarios of the taxonomy by policy makers, IT staff and researchers.}

We point out four distinct channels through which Internet can shape well-being: it changes time use patterns, creates new activities, facilitates access to information, and acts as powerful communication tool. We show how these four channels impact well-being in distinct domains of life. A central point emerging from the literature review is that the effects of Internet on well-being are mediated by a set of personal characteristics that are specific to each individual: psychological functioning, capabilities, and framing conditions (culture and beliefs). Hence, it is the interaction between human beings’ activities in distinct domains of life and their own personal characteristics that explains why the use of Internet has stronger positive effects for some individuals and social groups than others.}

Drawing on theories of gratifications, task-technology fit, and media dependency, we develop an integrative research model to understand Gen Yers’ mobile social media use intention in emergencies. Based on survey data from 424 Gen Y users in China, we conduct a structural equation modeling analysis and an artificial neural network analysis to validate the model. On one hand, social media dependency has a significant and positive effect on gratifications users seek during emergencies. Each gratification positively influences use intention except for information sharing. In order of the effects on use intention, communication is the most important, followed by solitary play and information seeking. On the other hand, both perceived mobility and task features positively influence perceived task-technology fit, which in turn exerts a significant effect on mobile social media use intention. The findings provide a fine-grained understanding of the relative importance of key predictors of mobile social media use intention in emergencies. Moreover, these findings, however limited to China’s Gen Y, suggest a role of solitary play and raise possible concern regarding an absence of information sharing.}

Among these, the food retail sector has undergone under the pressure of the crisis intense digital changes, which, however, have not yet been investigated under the theoretical lens of BMI. To fill this gap, the paper analyzes the digital actions taken during the pandemic crisis by two large food retailers, namely Walmart and Carrefour. Covering a wide temporal interval of the pandemic evolution and reviewing multiple geographical markets, the authors interpreted the grocer's digital responses to the crisis in terms of innovation in value creation and capture mechanisms. As a result, three phases of digital BMI have been reconstructed, each characterized by specific mechanisms of value creation and capture experienced by the two grocers during the pandemic. Leveraging these findings, the paper proposes a model capable of defining how digital BMI takes place in response to crises. Results broaden theoretical knowledge and practical suggestions on digital BMI in terms of enabling factors, actionable value mechanisms, and future business opportunities.}

Digital technologies are not a final solution but are the tools that facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response. In accordance, mobile applications, robots and drones, social media platforms (such as search engines, Twitter, and Facebook), television, and associated technologies deployed in tackling the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak are discussed adequately, emphasizing the current-state-of-art. A collective discussion on reported literature, press releases, and organizational claims are reviewed. This review addresses and highlights how these effective modern technological solutions can aid in healthcare (involving contact tracing, real-time isolation monitoring/screening, disinfection, quarantine enforcement, syndromic surveillance, and mental health), communication (involving remote assistance, information sharing, and communication support), logistics, tourism, and hospitality. The study discusses the benefits of these digital technologies in curtailing the pandemic and ‘how’ the different sectors adapted to these in a shorter period. Social media and television’s role in ensuring global connectivity and serving as a common platform to share authentic information among the general public were summarized. The World Health Organization and Governments’ role globally in-line with the prevention of propagation of false news, spreading awareness, and diminishing the severity of the COVID-19 was discussed. Furthermore, this collective review is helpful to investigators, health departments, Government organizations, and policymakers alike to facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response.}

Frequent overloading of the operator’s visual channel may result in accidents. To reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve overall operating performance, this paper proposes the extension of the HMI to the hearing modality. The proposed HMI takes the form of a spatial auditory display for complex navigation tasks such as path following (route guidance) or trajectory tracking. The interface incorporates two novel components. The first is the application of a modified “lookahead distance” guidance strategy, as a guidance law for generating a reference. The reference is presented to the operator as a spatial auditory image of the virtual target to be followed. Before being presented to the operator, the reference information is preconditioned through “supernormal” transformations to increase azimuth and distance resolution in regions of interest and thus to improve efficiency and overcome the comparative disadvantages of the hearing channel. A series of experiments show that the proposed guidance strategy provides a comprehensible and effective auditory reference. The enhanced supernormal auditory interface improves performance by reducing the tracking error of both path following and trajectory tracking compared to a non-enhanced interface without the supernormal transformation. Experiment participants report that the novel auditory interface is intuitive and easy to use, providing very good situational awareness. While the auditory interface investigated in this paper is shown to be effective for the teleoperation of unmanned vehicles, it may have other applications such as navigation for the visually impaired.}

After a disaster, communication failures are one of the essential causes of sufferers. To deal with this problem, offering “connectivity from the sky” is a novel and creative development. Aerial communications have been examined through the assessment and the design of the stratospheric platform capable of providing numerous types of wireless services. Drones, low and high-altitude platforms, airships, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are regarded as applicants for organizing aerial communications supplementing the infrastructure of global interaction. Aerial communication devices are vulnerable to being physically hijacked, destroyed, or lost. Therefore, security is a crucial issue in aerial communication networks. The blockchain technology is a potential solution candidate to tackle this issue. Blockchain is a decentralized and disseminated ledger, guards the distributed information using methods of cryptography, for example, public-key encryption and hash functions. It can use for guaranteeing the reliability of the data stored and for enhancing the transparency and security of aerial communication networks. This paper presents a survey on the integration of Blockchain with Aerial Communications (BAC). First, we study aerial communication networks and their current security issues, blockchain and its advantages, the feasibility and opportunity of applying the blockchain to resolve the current security issue in aerial communication networks. Next, we discuss current related solutions for applying the blockchain to resolve the current security issue in aerial communication networks in detail. We classify the solutions, compare and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we recommend some research directions for future investigations.}

Over the years, Logistic Service Providers (LSPs) have learned how to ensure resilience to confront uncertainties and risks triggered by adverse events. However, quite unlike any seen in recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic brings about unavoidable uncertainties and risks for the logistics industry. Yet, there is no common approach to contextualize how they interact together. We incorporate an empirical research design and make a threefold contribution: first, we identify uncertainties and risks that LSPs encounter during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate their prominence. Second, we unveil intertwined schemes of afore-identified uncertainties and risks and augment the understanding of their cause-effect structure. Third, we provide an uncertainty and risk assessment guideline for LSPs affected by threats emerging from unforeseeable crises. In this study, we combine qualitative work and the fuzzy DEMATEL method. Qualitative thematic analysis of in-depth interviews reveals the most important uncertainties (COVID-19 measures, employee welfare, forecast horizon, demand change, and government regulations) and risks (COVID-19 risk, delivery delays, supply chain disruptions, financial failure, and product returns) for LSPs. The fuzzy DEMATEL method shows that COVID-19 measures and COVID-19 risk are highly prominent and influence other factors. The results indicate that demand change, government regulations, and supply chain disruptions are net causers, and employee welfare, financial failure, forecast horizon, delivery delays, and product returns are net receivers. Distinctly, employee welfare is the most affected factor, empirically confirming that major risks for LSPs are related to the human factor. More investigation in our results suggests that supply chain disruptions and demand change, two factors triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, influence financial failure and forecast horizon, two factors associated with operational performance.}

The execution of natural hazard models using traditional ICT foundations is not possible in a timely manner due to the complex nature of the models, the need for large-scale computational resources as well as intensive data and concurrent-access requirements. Cloud Computing can address these challenges with near-unlimited capacity for computation, storage, and networking, and the ability, to offer natural hazard modeling systems as end services, has now become more realistic than ever. However, researchers face several open challenges in adopting and utilizing Cloud Computing technologies during disasters. As such, this survey paper aggregates all these challenges, reflects on the current research trends and outlines a conceptual Cloud-based solution framework for more effective natural hazards modeling and management systems using Cloud infrastructure in conjunction with other technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks, fog, and edge computing.

A sample of 51 university students were administered written learning material in a between-subjects design study, wherein one group read text about sarcoma cancer on a physical pamphlet in the real world, and the other group read identical text on a virtual pamphlet embedded in an immersive VR environment which resembled a hospital room. The study combined advanced EEG measurement techniques, learning tests, and cognitive load measures to compare conditions. Results show that the VR group performed significantly better on a knowledge transfer post-test. However, reading in VR was found to be more cognitively effortful and less time-efficient. Findings suggest the significance of environmental embeddedness for learning, and provide important considerations for the design of educational VR environments, as we remediate learning content from non-immersive to immersive media.}

These cultural differences introduce a layer of uncertainty into chaotic operational contexts that are marked by moments of intense stress, and often contribute to strong emotional responses such as anxiety or anger. Unchecked, these emotional responses can escalate and lead Warfighters to make judgments and decisions they might not otherwise make. In high stakes situations, even the slightest mistake may have tragic consequences; thus, a need exists to equip Warfighters with skills that allow them to recognize/regulate their emotions. Emotional Intelligence (EI) “is the ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions” [1]. Learning effective strategies to manage our emotions is critical for laying a strong foundation for the development of positive relationships [2], [3]. Being able to effectively build positive relationships in diverse settings is a key attribute of cross cultural competence that may be improved through EI training. By practicing emotion recognition/regulation strategies, individuals will begin to replace ineffective decision-making with productive responses to challenging situations. In order to understand how emotions can influence decision making and social judgment, various moderating factors need to be considered, including cultural, group, and individual differences in emotional recognition/regulation [4]. We provide a brief overview of the operational need, define the basic tenets of EI, and describe how this approach could be implemented within an existing military training setting. We describe how emotion recognition and regulation skills would be exercised and evaluated and list potential benefits of using immersive training for skill development. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future research and development in this area.}

UAVs are widely used through different phases of construction, from aerial mapping, safety and quality monitoring and site logistics to structural inspection and maintenance assessment. While there is significant research about the benefits of UAVs for specific construction-related tasks, there is a dearth of research examining the impact of working with or near UAVs on the health and safety of workers. In this theory-driven paper, we examined UAV integration in construction workplaces from a health and safety perspective, categorized the potential ways UAVs might affect the construction workers’ health and safety, and provided a roadmap for future research in this area. The study used inferential and VR visualization techniques to identify the risks posed by UAVs, which were categorized into three groups of (1) physical risks, (2) attentional costs, and (3) psychological impacts. We then proposed a concurrent and cross-functional two-branch research road map to advance our knowledge about human-UAV interactions and develop regulatory and technological measures to ensure safe integration of UAVs in construction. The first branch shall empirically evaluate different ways UAVs can adversely impact workers’ health and safety. The second branch shall use these findings to develop regulatory and administrative interventions to guide the UAVs’ safe operation on construction sites and develop innovative hardware and software components for future UAVs to ensure their safe co-operation with human workers.}

This huge amount of data coming continuously from the crisis site leads to an ever-changing situational awareness that must be built and understood as quickly as it is evolving to ensure a relevant and effective crisis response. To build a shared situational awareness, decision-makers can gather in a room where they can share and compare the information they receive from the crisis site to build a common operational picture that they can use to make decisions and implement them: this is a crisis management cell. However, the tools in traditional crisis management cells may not be able to keep up with the new requirements induced by these changes: we need modular and dynamic tools able to adapt to the crisis and the needs of the crisis managers while ensuring collaboration and information sharing not only between the stakeholders but also with remote experts that might be needed to understand the situation. We need to start conceiving the future crisis management cell that would meet the new exigencies of crisis management. This paper proposes our version of that future crisis management cell, using virtual reality to provide a dynamic and modular crisis management cell linked to artificial intelligence and decision-support systems.}

This article proposes a definition and way to frame serious games technologies, applications and environments along a continuum of gaming characteristics or gameness. From those with traditional gaming activities and characteristics (challenge, play, fun, etc.) at one end to those with minimal traditional gaming characteristics at the other end, whose main purpose is to provide experience and emotion to convey meaning. The main advantages of the definition and continuum are to establish a shared understanding and arena for current and emerging serious games, frame and connect currently fragmented groups into a cohesive serious games movement and community and open opportunities for future collaborative research and development.

abstract = {Tourists are increasingly using drones on vacation, but how they use them and the nature of the videos that they produce are not well understood. Conceptual advances in the study of tourist videography have produced a new model of these practices which is applied here to explain the nature of tourist videography with drones. An international sample of 351 vacation drone videos was subjected to content analysis, and an analysis of their metadata. The results show a significant variation in the content, technological and social practice of production of vacation drone videos depending on the type of video creator and, therefore, empirically validate and expand extant knowledge of drone videography as an emerging visual practice in tourism contexts. The findings establish that analysing the videos from the perspective of videography generates insights that are of value to destination management organizations and tourist businesses. We conclude that destination management organizations should see vacation drone videos as a new type of user-generated content for their destinations, as well as a potential source of innovative marketing ideas, and that they should engage more proactively with vacation drone videographers to maximise the impact of this opportunity.}

The dexterity measures involved in controlling input modalities could pose challenges to users with motor disabilities—including the inability to move their limbs, particularly their upper and lower arms, and fingers, due to traumatic damage or congenital problems. In order to meet these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual reality (VR)-based medium to help users with motor disabilities build simple 3D models for architectural design. The concept of operating buttons using head-gaze in the VR environment has been utilised to perform scaling—a 3D object manipulation method—to create simplified building models. Moreover, navigation in the VR space using tilting of the head has been employed with the user seated on a revolving chair, thus eliminating the need for any limbic movement. Unity game engine was used to develop two variations of the VR model with a different button layout for creating simple cuboidal volumes mimicking buildings in the virtual environment. Both variations have been tested with 32 individuals against a specific performance indicator (i.e., task completion time) and self-reported metrics, such as the perception of effort applied and degree of visual clutter, followed by retrospective participant feedback sessions. One of the VR application's variants (i.e., variant 1) produced promising results regarding overall usability and effort demand. This paper also proposes a methodological framework for an AI-based, intelligent, and adaptive VR application interface that caters to the user's abilities and pain points in real-time. In the future, this framework could be instrumental in creating a comprehensive gaze-based VR tool for 3D modelling having multiple functions to help users with motor disabilities.}

The paper discusses the benefits of integrating and interlinking a dynamic process simulator with a dynamic accident simulator in order to train operators (particularly field operators) to respond effectively to abnormal situations, thus enabling them to recognize and recover anomalies and malfunctions, especially when they might lead to accidents.

We demonstrate its successful use in a system consisting of a global positioning system receiver and an inertial measurement unit. Localization is based on the dead reckoning algorithm. In order to obtain more reliable information from data fusion, which is carried out with Kalman filtering, the proposed methodology involves: (1) evaluation of the information provided by the sensors and (2) adaptability of the filtering. By carefully analyzing these factors we accomplish fault detection in different sources of information and in filtering. This allows us to apply corrections whenever the system requires it. Hence, our methodology consists of two stages. In the first stage, the evaluation is conducted. We apply the principles of causal diagnosis using possibility theory by defining states for normal behavior and for fault states. When a fault occurs, corrective measures are applied according to empirical knowledge. In the second stage, the consistency test of the filtering is performed. If this is inconsistent, principles of adaptive Kalman filtering are applied, which means the process and measurement noise matrices are tuned. Our results indicate a reasonable improvement of the trajectory obtained. At the same time, we can achieve consistent filtering, to obtain a more robust system and reliable information.}

This resulted in the evaluation of 67 relevant journal articles collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The review revealed that ImTs have been applied for OSH training and education in various industries including transportation, construction, mining, and healthcare. It was also revealed that the OSH hazards addressed by ImT-based training and education include but are not limited to fire, fall, electrical and chemical hazards in order to prevent or reduce injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition, it was revealed that one of the benefits of ImTs for OSH training and education is better retention of concepts when compared to conventional training and education. Challenges associated with the use of ImTs for OSH training and education include insufficient display brightness for users to effectively see virtual objects in a brightly luminated environment. Among the recommendations for future work is research into how to develop effective communication methods between trainers and trainees immersed in a virtual environment for trainers to fully understand the difficulties trainees experience in operating the developed ImT-based platform and provide solutions to such difficulties.}

Although, these developments have been well recognized at the application level, however crucial to the virtual training system is the effective and reliable measurement of training performance of the particular skill and handling the experiment for long-run. It is known that motor skills cannot be measured directly, but only inferred by observing behaviour or performance measures. The typical way of measuring performance is through measuring task completion time and accuracy, but can be supported by indirect measurement of some other factors. In this paper, a virtual crane training system has been developed which can be controlled using control commands extracted from facial gestures and is capable to lift up loads/materials in the virtual construction sites. Then, we integrate affective computing concept into the conventional VR training platform for measuring the cognitive load and level of satisfaction during performance using human's forehead bioelectric-signals. By employing the affective measures and our novel control scheme, the designed interface could be adapted to user's affective status during the performance in real-time. This adaptable user interface approach helps the trainee to cope with the training for long-run performance, leads to gaining more expertise and provides more effective transfer of learning to other operation environments. The detailed methodology of the affective control is presented in the paper. The results and future applications of the proposed method for disabled users, especially from neck down are discussed.}

Part of the pathway to SHBE is the engagement of robots to manage the ever-complex facilities for tasks such as inspection and disinfection. However, despite the increasing advancements of robot intelligence, it is still “mission impossible” for robots to independently undertake such open-ended problems as facility management, calling for a need to “team up” the robots with humans. Leveraging digital twin's ability to capture real-time data and inform decision-making via dynamic simulation, this study aims to develop a human-robot teaming framework for facility management to achieve sustainability and healthiness in the built environments. A digital twin-enabled prototype system is developed based on the framework. Case studies showed that the framework can safely and efficiently incorporate robotics into facility management tasks (e.g., patrolling, inspection, and cleaning) by allowing humans to plan, oversee, manage, and cooperate with the robot via the digital twin's bi-directional mechanism. The study lays out a high-level framework, under which purposeful efforts can be made to unlock digital twin's full potential in collaborating humans and robots in facility management towards SHBE.}

Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

First responders need to identify and locate these critical voids for rapid search and rescue operations. Due to the complex and unstructured occlusions in disaster areas, visual and manual search is time-consuming and error-prone. In this study, we proposed a novel method to automatically detect, locate, and characterize voids buried in disaster rubble using ground penetrating radar (GPR). After preprocessing the collected radargrams, the boundaries of potential voids are segmented based on radar signal patterns, and the 95% confidence intervals are constructed around the segmented boundaries to account for uncertainties. To improve the detection accuracy, the geometric relations of the detected boundaries and their signal characteristics are examined to confirm the void existence. Then, the void location and dimension are estimated based on calibrated velocity of radar wave and its travel time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method were manifested by its performance in laboratory and field experiments. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, the feasibility of using GPR to detect, locate, and characterize voids in collapsed structures is experimentally tested, innovatively extending the application of GPR to search and rescue operations. Second, algorithms are developed to process non-intuitive radargrams to provide first responders actionable information.}

abstract = {In the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, tsunami inundation caused devastating damage over a wide area along the coast of the Tohoku region. Since then, hazard maps for tsunami flooding have been prepared or updated nationwide. These maps assume flooding in the event of a tsunami of the extreme class (L2) with a recurrence interval of 1000 years, in which the top priority is to protect lives. However, once an earthquake occurs, the situation of inundation differs depending on the earthquake rupture mechanisms and its magnitude, so the area of unexpected damage needs to be grasped as soon as possible. Therefore, a forecast of tsunami inundation and damage needs to be provided immediately after the disaster to support disaster responders’ decisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to utilize a tsunami inundation and damage forecast. Specifically, we introduce “recovery levels”, which allow areas that need immediate response to be more easily recognized to allocate human and physical resources. We evaluated their usefulness from the viewpoint of disaster responders by surveying users in a local government through a disaster response drill and an explanatory meeting. Consequently, it was found that the recognition and understanding of the tsunami forecast advanced, and many positive opinions were obtained about utilizing the forecast in the initial activity of disaster response.}

This study focuses on investigating the status of UAS regulatory compliance in the U.S. from the perspectives of UAS ownership registration and maximum flight altitude limitation, analyzing the socio-demographic factors of UAS users and their relationship with regulatory compliance. A U.S. national representative survey was performed for data collection. Descriptive statistics illustrate the overall status of UAS regulatory compliance and the demographic characteristics of the adult UAS users. Canonical correlation analysis was adopted to explore the pattern between variables of regulatory compliance and socio-demographic factors. Logistic regression was used to identify influencing socio-demographic factors for compliance behavior of UAS users on two specific rules. Results present 1) the demographic features of the adult UAS users in the U.S., 2) the overall status of UAS regulatory compliance in terms of ownership registration and maximum flight altitude limitation, and 3) the relationship between UAS regulatory compliance and influencing socio-demographic factors. Findings of this study provide aviation regulation authorities and UAS law enforcement important insights into UAS regulatory compliance to further develop more effective policies and strategies to safely and sustainably regulate UAS activities.}

We performed two user studies to investigate the influence of these devices on users’ workload, motion sickness, and performance in the domain of work safety training. The first experiment included 61 participants and sought to understand whether and how VR displays providing different fields of view affects the users’ ability to search for risks in an office-like virtual environment (focus on user perception). Subsequently, we conducted a second experiment involving 46 subjects, where we assess whether and how interaction techniques providing different degrees-of-freedom influence users’ ability to learn procedural tasks (focus on knowledge gain). From our results, we learned that users’ knowledge on the simulation’s topic (i.e. work safety) and gaming experience play an important role in VR simulations, and that cybersickness symptoms such as disorientation are likely caused by unawareness of one’s surroundings instead of VR content.}

The literature (153 articles) published over the past five years were collected and analyzed systematically, pertaining to the lifecycle model of the product–service system, i.e., design, development, evaluation, and applications. The review indicated that immersive systems and scenarios have been developed and applied in various transportation areas, such as air traffic management, autonomous vehicles, railways, highways, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, the review indicated that immersive technology brings significant benefits to the transportation field and induces significant changes in the interactions between humans and the physical world. These changes are expected to induce digital transformation in several aspects, e.g., digital testbeds for theoretical models and algorithms, immersive and safe digital environments for user studies, and digital training. Based on the review, a novel framework and conceptual lifecycle model of developing immersive technology-enabled digital transformation in transportation is proposed, a novel evaluation matrix for measuring the immersive experience level is established.

Amplified by the speed and scope of social media, they can quickly reach millions of people and result in a wide range of marketplace deceptions. However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn. We then accumulate and present knowledge on the strategies and mechanisms to safeguard against deepfake-based marketplace deception. Furthermore, we uncover and report the various legitimate opportunities offered by this new technology. Finally, we present an agenda for future research in this emergent and highly critical area.}

The XR device, which is at the core of this method, supports an interactive environment using a holographic overlay of graphical information on the spatial environment and physical objects being inspected. By leveraging this capability, a novel XR-supported inspection pipeline, called eXtended Reality-based Inspection and Visualization (XRIV), is developed. Key tasks supported by this method include detecting visual damage from sensory data acquired by the XR device, estimating its size, and visualizing (overlaying) information on the spatial environment. The crucial step of real-time interactive segmentation—detection and pixel-wise damage boundary refinement—is achieved using a feature Back-propagating Refinement Scheme (f-BRS) algorithm. Then, a ray-casting algorithm is applied to back-project the 2D image pixel coordinates of the damage region to their 3D world coordinates for damage area quantification in real-world (physical) units. Finally, the area information is overlaid and anchored to the scene containing damage for visualization and documentation. The performance of XRIV is experimentally demonstrated by measuring surface structural damage of an in-service concrete bridge with less than 10% errors for two different test cases, and image processing latency of 2–3 s (or 0.5 s per seed point) from f-BRS. The proposed XRIV pipeline underscores the advantages of real-time interaction between expert users and the XR device through immersive visualization so that a human–machine collaborative workflow can be established to obtain better inspection outcomes in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

abstract = {Objective
Virtual (VR), augmented (AR), mixed reality (MR) and haptic interfaces make additional avenues available for surgeon assessment, guidance and training. We evaluated applications for open trauma and emergency surgery to address the question: Have new computer-supported interface developments occurred that could improve trauma training for civilian and military surgeons performing open, emergency, non-laparoscopic surgery?
Design
Systematic literature review.
Setting and Participants
Faculty, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore., Maryland; Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.
Methods
Structured literature searches identified studies using terms for virtual, augmented, mixed reality and haptics, as well as specific procedures in trauma training courses. Reporting bias was assessed. Study quality was evaluated by the Kirkpatrick's Level of evidence and the Machine Learning to Asses Surgical Expertise (MLASE) score.
Results
Of 422 papers identified, 14 met inclusion criteria, included 282 enrolled subjects, 20% were surgeons, the remainder students, medics and non-surgeon physicians. Study design was poor and sample sizes were low. No data analyses were beyond descriptive and the highest outcome types were procedural success, subjective self-reports, except three studies used validated metrics. Among the 14 studies, Kirkpatrick's level of evidence was level zero in five studies, level 1 in 8 and level 2 in one. Only one study had MLASE Score greater than 9/20. There was a high risk of bias in 6 studies, uncertain bias in 5 studies and low risk of bias in 3 studies.
Conclusions
There was inadequate evidence that VR,MR,AR or haptic interfaces can facilitate training for open trauma surgery or replace cadavers. Because of limited testing in surgeons, deficient study and technology design, risk of reporting bias, no current well-designed studies of computer-supported technologies have shown benefit for open trauma, emergency surgery nor has their use shown improved patient outcomes. Larger more rigorously designed studies and evaluations by experienced surgeons are required for a greater variety of procedures and skills.

abstract = {Online virtual learning resources have been available for learning and teaching in forensic science for some years now, but the recent global COVID-19 related periods of irregular lockdown have necessitated the rapid development of these for teaching, learning and CPD activities. However, these resources do need to be carefully constructed and grounded in pedagogic theory to be effective. This article details eXtended Reality (XR) learning and teaching environments to facilitate effective online teaching and learning for forensic geoscientists. The first two case studies discussed in this article make use of Thinglink software to produce virtual learning and teaching XR resources through an internet system, which was delivered to undergraduate students in 2021. Case one details a range of XR virtual laboratory-based equipment resources, providing a consistent, reliable and asynchronous learning and teaching experience, whilst the second case study presents an XR virtual learning applied geophysics resource developed for a 12-week CPD training programme. This programme involves recorded equipment video resources, accompanying datasets and worksheets for users to work through. Both case studies were positively received by learners, but there were issues encountered by learners with poor internet connections or computer skills, or who do not engage well with online learning. A third case study showcases an XR educational forensic geoscience eGame that was developed to take the user through a cold case search investigation, from desktop study through to field reconnaissance and multi-staged site investigations. Pedagogic research was undertaken with user questionnaires and interviews, providing evidence that the eGame was an effective learning and teaching tool. eGame users highly rated the eGame and reported that they raised awareness and understanding of the use of geophysics equipment and best practice of forensic geoscience search phased investigations. These types of XR virtual learning digital resources, whilst costly to produce in terms of development time and staff resource, provide a complementary virtual learning experience to in-situ practical sessions, and allow learners to asynchronously familiarise themselves with equipment, environments and techniques resulting in more efficient use of in situ time. The XR resources also allow learners to reinforce learning post in-situ sessions. Finally, XR resources can provide a more inclusive and authentic experience for learners who cannot attend or complete work synchronously.}

Ubiquitous Computing, a vision of invisible computing integrated in our everyday surroundings, first introduced by M. Weiser and his group at Xerox PARC in 1988, is still in its early infancy and far from leaving the laboratory stage. Nevertheless there are foreseeable applications in specific areas like automotive automation, health care, home automation, advanced manufacturing. Some aspects of Ubiquitous Computing from an automatic control perspective and its relation to mixed reality, augmented reality and pervasive computing will be covered. Several problems like geometric representation, extensible computing, scalability, movable interactions, integration of various network-technologies, user interface design for multi-modality, design methodologies and evaluation techniques, security/privacy issues and enabling software concepts are touched and it will be speculated about how Ubiquitous Computing might influence Low Cost Advanced Manufacturing and how experiences from the automation and control field might influence the emerging community.}

abstract = {Spawned by fast paced progress in marine science and technology, the past two decades have witnessed growing interest in ocean exploration and exploitation for scientific and commercial purposes, the development of technological products for the maritime and offshore industries, and a host of other activities in which the marine environment takes center stage. In this context, marine robotics has steadily emerged as a key enabling technology for the execution of increasingly complex and challenging missions at sea. Intensive research and development in this field have led to major advances and shown unequivocally the effectiveness and reliability of marine robotics solutions in several domains. This progress goes hand in hand with the availability of increasingly sophisticated acoustic networks for multiple, cooperative missions involving surface and underwater robots. At the root of this trend is the fruitful dialogue between robotic systems developers and end-users with the capacity to convert general mission objectives into functional and technical specifications that serve as application-driven requirements for engineering development. The result is the tremendous progress observed in the consolidated methodologies and procedures adopted and the consequent impact on science, industry, and the society at large. In spite of the progress in the area, however many challenges must still be faced and novel applications will continue to set further requirements for future generations of marine robots and their enabling systems. The time is therefore appropriate to overview recent trends in the field of marine robotics and assess their impact on several important application domains. With these objectives in mind, in the present paper we highlight key technological achievements in the field, analyze some of the shortcomings encountered, and indicate specific issues that warrant further research and development effort. To this end, we review a number of highly representative projects in the field, with due account for the theoretical frameworks upon which technological developments build upon. Finally, the paper concludes with an outlook on the future of marine robotics, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, and describes recently initiated projects that hold promise for the development of advanced tools and systems for ocean exploration and exploitation.}

Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees’ final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees’ trace data through a visualization tool to pose non-observable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees’ final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.}

abstract = {Nearly every week, a technology company is introducing a new surveillance technology, varying from applying facial recognition to observing and cataloguing behaviours of the public in the Commons and private spaces, to listening and recording what we say, or mapping what we do, where we go, and who we're with—or as much of these facets of our lives as can be accessed. As such, the general public writ-large has had to wrestle with the colonization of publicly funded space, and the outcomes to each of our personal lives as a result of the massive harvesting and storing of our data, and the potential machine learning and processing applied to that data. Facebook, once content to harvest our data through its website, cookies, and apps on mobile phones and computers, has now planned to follow us more deeply into the Commons by developing new mapping technology combined with smart camera equipped Augmented Reality (AR) eyeglasses, that will track, render and record the Commons—and us with it. The resulting data will privately benefit Facebook's continued goal to expand its worldwide reach and growth. In this paper, we examine the ethical implications of Facebook's Project Aria research pilot through the perspectives of Responsible Innovation, comparing both existing understandings of Responsible Research and Innovation and Facebook's own Responsible Innovation Principles; we contextualise Project Aria within the Commons through applying current social multi-dimensional communications theory to understand the extensive socio-technological implications of Project Aria within society and culture; and we address the potentially serious consequences of the Facebook Project Aria experiment, inspiring countless other companies to shift their focus to compete with Project Aria, or beat it to the consumer marketplace.}

However, the decision to utilize such techniques remains a difficult one, given their perceived complexity, their variety of scopes and means and their expected limitations for utilization in jobsites. This paper presents a critical review of cognitive analysis techniques to analyze their value for construction management research. The evaluation is geared towards identifying the function of different types of techniques as well as constraints for their implementation in construction environments. In the evaluation, the components of techniques are dissected to uncover their individual capabilities and applications, while also providing insight into the actual difficulties to collect and represent knowledge. This analysis is complemented by the authors' experience in previous cognitive analysis studies, which helps produce a set of recommendations about the practical challenges and implications of deploying specific techniques in construction jobsites.}

The analysis was guided by four overarching questions: (1) What were robots used for in the COVID-19 response? (2) When were they used? (3) How did different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics influence a country’s innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the data was examined through the lens of the technology’s maturity according to NASA’s Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often and for broader purposes. Finally, the dataset and analysis produces a broad set of implications that warrant further study and investigation. The results from this analysis are expected to be of value to the robotics and robotics policy community in preparing robots for rapid insertion into future disasters.}

Although still conceptual, Metaverse converges the physical and digital universe, allowing users to seamlessly traverse between them. Digital immersion offers opportunities for people to travel in time, supporting users to experience virtually ancient encounters, space explorations or dangerous natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions. Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse. Although still experimental, Metaverse is expected to revolutionize travel and tourism management and marketing. It empowers destination awareness, positioning and branding, as well as coordination and management, through digital twins. Metaverse provides opportunities to support trip planning, interaction and engagement, effectively transforming consumer behaviour. Visiting and engaging with destinations virtually is expected to motivate real travel, rather than replace it. This paper provides a vision of how Metaverse can revolutionize tourism experiences and transform tourism management and marketing. Drawing on a systematic review of scholarly works, articles from media and industry reports, this study defines and conceptualizes the Metaverse ecosystem for tourism and travel. It explores the foundations of the disruptions that Metaverse brings to tourism destinations and organisations and identifies the building blocks of Metaverse tourism. The study outlines research directions so that the tourism industry can take full advantage of the Metaverse capabilities and opportunities emerging as well as identify challenges for the future.}

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

In order to test the efficiency of evacuation signage, the traditional methods are video analysis and after-drill questionnaires and the human factors are rarely considered. This paper investigates the impact of surrounding pedestrians on the sign guidance efficiency during building emergency evacuation, replacing the traditional ways with eye tracking device method. More than 500 participants were involved in the series of experiments to test the influence of surrounding people on detecting and following signages. It is found that (a) the subjective ignorance and objective ignorance of signs exist obviously and are affected by surrounding people number; (b) strangers and acquaintances have similar effect on the sign detection probability and direction choosing probability in the safe and quick evacuation experiments, contrary to general belief; (c) One surrounding person has an important influence on the sign guidance effect, especially on the following probability, while three surrounding people not. Based on the results of the experiments, a new logic of wayfinding within rooms was put forward and simulated to compared with the original logic. It is shown that the average right direction choosing percentage decreases by 30% after considering the effect of surrounding pedestrians, proving that the impact of surrounding pedestrians must be considered in evacuation modeling and evacuation route design.}

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

All of us have evolved to think and store memory in 3-dimensions i.e when we look at the information in a flat piece of paper or computer screen, our brain takes its own time to translate it back to a 2D visual and store it. This is how our education system is, it started with textbook material and recently educators have started encouraging the use of smart classes which again shows videos. As a result, there is no practical exposure that lags us a step behind. This is where a promising technology of the future called Augmented Reality holds for us. Learners will have a 360-degree view of the real-world entities, interacting with those entities by touching them which will eventually make them have better insight about the concepts. Hence our learning curve decreases increasing the brain's productivity. With the development of smartphones, Augmented Reality is applied to a broader range. Augmented reality can turn an ordinary classroom into an engaging experience. The aim is to implement an interactive Augmented Reality Experience using Vuforia, Unity 3D and Blender. The purpose is to promote situational learning, experimental learning, transformative learning as the learning theory basis of mobile Augmented Reality.}

This work presents a preliminary prototype that enables the extinguishing of a fire on a container ship as a VR training scenario. The prototype provides a full-body and multi-user VR experience, based on the synthesis of position data provided by the motion capture system and orientation data from the VR headsets. As a consequence, the prototype allows an initial evaluation of results. The results confirm the value of using VR to train procedures that are difficult to train in the real world. Furthermore, the results show that motion capture based VR technologies are particularly useful for firefighting training, in which participants can collaborate in otherwise difficult-to-access environments.

Based on the classifications of the input/output devices that are used in the VR system, the current VR training systems for the mining industry could be divided into three types: screen-based general type, projector-based customized type, and head-mounted display (HMD)-based intuitive type. By employing a VR headset, a smartphone and a leap motion device, an HMD-based intuitive type VR training system prototype for drilling in underground mines has been developed. Ten trainees tried both the HMD-based intuitive system and the screen-based general control system to compare the experiences and training effects. The results show that the HMD-based system can give a much better user experience and is easy to use. Three of the five components of a VR training system, namely, the user, the tasks, and software and database should be given more attention in future research. With more available technologies of input and output devices, VR engines, and system software, the VR training system will eventually yield much better training results, and will play a more important role in as a training tool for mine safety.}

Nevertheless, technical standards for different types of metaverses have yet to be defined, making investigation difficult. Furthermore, even though metaverses are complex forms that combine multiple hardware devices and software applications, existing studies have either focused on a single component or not analyzed the real-world environment. In this study, we derived a metaverse ecosystem with common components that comprise a metaverse and analyzed the hardware and software used throughout the user's metaverse lifecycle from a digital forensics perspective. In particular, we applied real-case-based scenario to the metaverse environment of the most popular Meta's currently in use to identify various artifacts that can be used across the ecosystem and validate the effectiveness of the process.

The Hospital and Biogarden games’ scenarios were based on the joint activities held in 2018 in France and Belgium as part of the EU H2020 European Network Of CBRN Training CEnters (eNOTICE) project, while the mining game was created over a replica of a training mine at a university in Turkey. Sixteen CBRN-e experts from the eNOTICE project, who took part in the physical training programs in France and Belgium, evaluated the games. For evaluation and extensive feedback, presence, system usability scale, technology acceptance model questionnaires, and open-ended questions were conducted. The findings revealed that serious games have a vast potential in CBRN-e training, and the comparisons of different environments provided invaluable testbeds giving hindsight to develop a future training program.}

abstract = {Among the main features of Industry 4.0, digitization and the evolution of the human-machine interaction occupy a central role. These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0. The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training.}

For this it is important that people are properly trained. Faced with the economic, ecological and organizational requirements and constraints linked to fire safety training, virtual training environments appear to be a judicious alternative to traditional training. However, before committing companies to invest in expensive devices, it is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such devices. The literature is rich and divided on this subject, and it appears that certain characteristics of the system and of the learners are decisive. In this context, the objective of our work was to study the effects of immersion, the feeling of presence as well as the interaction between these 2 factors on the performance of conceptual and procedural learning. Certain variables were also controlled such as gender, tendency to immersion, previous experience in computers and video games. Our work shows that immersion promotes procedural but not conceptual learning, and that neither the sense of presence, nor the interaction between immersion and the sense of presence affect these two types of learning in our training task. Apart from the knowledge of fire which potentiates the effect of immersion on procedural learning, the variables considered in our study (computer experience, video game experience and genre) had no impact on performance. Understanding the impact of the technical device or the characteristics of users on conceptual and procedural learning is a major challenge in helping trainers to develop pedagogical devices in order to better exploit the opportunities offered by new technological approaches.}

Therefore, there is an increased demand for envisioning the 6G wireless communication systems to overcome the major limitations in the existing 5G networks. Moreover, incorporating artificial intelligence in 6G will provide solutions for very complex problems relevant to network optimization. Furthermore, to add further value to the future 6G networks, researchers are investigating new technologies, such as THz and quantum communications. The requirements of future 6G wireless communications demand to support massive data-driven applications and the increasing number of users.

E-participation, as any means of engagement with the common good, is, however, a difficult area of human motivation as it can be seen to exist outside the common hurdles of the everyday life and where the effects of participation are often invisible or take a long time to materialize. Recent trends of digitalization, such as gamification; a popular approach for stimulating motivation, have been proposed as remedies to foster e-participation. A plethora of applications and research has emerged related to gamified e-participation. However, there is currently a dearth in our knowledge of how gamification is being applied, researched or what its possible positive and negative outcomes can be. This study employed a systematic literature review approach in order to summarize research and findings on gamified e-participation. 66 papers were reviewed, the majority of which indicated that gamified e-participation is linked to increased engagement, motivation, civic learning and enjoyment amongst other outcomes. Nonetheless, question remains as to ethical and inclusive gamification, for which, this research provides directions for future research.}

abstract = {Background
Cue exposure therapy (CET) techniques involves repeated and controlled exposures to alcohol stimuli which rest upon the well-established principles of Pavlovian extinction (Byrne et al., 2019). However, the efficacy of CET while treating alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is still a matter of debate. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of CET on AUDs by using previous meta-analysis study on the same topic from Mellentin et al. (2017) as a base.
Methods
A computer-assisted search of relevant articles identified 879 studies in Medline, PsycInfo and Embase, of which 11 studies (published between 1992 and 2019) were selected. Three outcome measures were extracted: alcohol consumption defined as drinks per day (drinking intensity) and alcohol reduction defined as drinking days and relapse (drinking frequency). This study is registered with PROSPERO (Registration no: #CRD42021259077).
Results
The present meta-analytical review found small to medium effect on drinks per day (g = -0.35; 95 %CI -0.72 to 0.03), drinking days (g = -0.30; 95 %CI -0.54 to -0.06) and relapse (OR = -0.58; 95 %CI 0.29 to 1.15) while investigating the efficacy of CET on AUDs. GRADE assessment was used to evaluate the overall quality, and it was assessed as low. Regarding Risk of Bias, the studies in this systematic review were evaluated with “some concerns”.
Conclusion
The present meta-analysis demonstrated that CET has small to medium effect on drinks per day, drinking days and relapse. Future research should strive to conduct larger scale multi-site CET trials with additional methodological innovations and increase retention.}

In order to monitor these illicit activities and enhance public safety, crime rate detection is essential. Social media can be used to identify crime rates in various parts of any nation, which can dramatically lower crime rates. Social media are a source of information as well as a tool for communication. Twitter, which has a user base of more than 300 million, makes a suitable choice for data analysis. The Spizella swarm based BiLSTM classifier is used for the detection of crime rate in this research. While performing social network analysis using the BiLSTM classifier for the determination of crime rate providing faster convergence is a crucial factor and this faster convergence is achieved by the proposed Spizella swarm optimization. BiLSTM classifier effectively identified the crime rate and the BiLSTM performance is boosted by the Spizella swarm optimization where the escaping characteristics of Spizella improve the convergence and help in attaining desired results Additional training is given by the BiLSTM classifier by traversing the outputs and this BiLSTM classifier are more efficient in the text classification. Measuring the metrics values for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method and the proposed Spizella swarm optimization achieved an improvement of 0.5 %, 1.16 %, and 1.08 %, which is more efficient.}

To this aim, a VRTS was developed and used to conduct two user studies: a first study designed to investigate the effectiveness of the devised system when used as an alternative or in combination with lecture and laboratory-based teaching experiences, and a second study aimed to compare two different approaches (traditional learning, TL, and learning by teaching, LBT) for exploiting the provided VR-based functionalities in a learning path. Experimental results showed that the use of the VRTS alone improved the participants’ performance compared to traditional experiences, and that LBT proved to be more effective that TL for practical learning purposes.}

abstract = {Background
Despite its well documented risks and harms, methamphetamine use can also be experienced as a pleasurable, purposeful, and productive activity. Drug use discourse has historically deemphasised the pleasures of drug use, as they can contradict the expectations of neoliberalism that individuals be moderate, rational consumers. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of people trying to reduce or control their methamphetamine use, utilising a critical interactionist approach to excavate the subjugated knowledge of methamphetamine-related pleasure, and construct an understanding of methamphetamine use that incorporated these positive experiences.
Methods
Qualitative interviews and ethnographic observation were conducted over an eight-month period with a group of twelve people using methamphetamine and accessing recovery services. Transcripts and fieldnotes were analysed thematically with a critical interactionist lens.
Results
The pleasures of methamphetamine use were differentiated into pursuing the rush, exploring sociality, self-medication, and desiring productivity. The interwoven nature of these themes presents a multidimensional understanding of methamphetamine use resulting from a cascade of interacting causes and effects, rather than a linear product of individual choice or structural forces. These findings also highlight the complex symbiotic relationship between pleasure, productivity, and risk for people using methamphetamine which can be traced to the broader cultural and economic context in which use occurs.
Conclusion
Interventions and policies responding to harmful methamphetamine use must address the content and nature of the methamphetamine use cascade, acknowledging the diverse needs methamphetamine can meet for contemporary neoliberal citizens, and the sometimes complex and sophisticated purposes for which people may utilise its effects.}

abstract = {Cutting-edge digital visualisation tools (CDVT) are playing an increasingly important role in improving urban flood risk management. However, there is a paucity of comprehensive research examining their role across all stages of urban flood risk management. To address, this study conducts an integrated critical review to identify the application of CDVT and assess their contribution to the prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery stages of flood risk management. The results show that virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital twin technologies are the primary CDVT used in urban flood visualisation, with virtual reality being the most frequently used. The focus of urban flood visualisation studies has been primarily on preparation and mitigation stages. However, there is a need to investigate the application of these technologies in the entire urban water cycle. Furthermore, there is potential for greater adoption of digital twin, especially in simulating urban flood inundation and flood evacuation routes. Integrating real-time data, data-driven modeling, and CDVT can significantly improve real-time flood forecasting. This benefits stakeholders and the public by enhancing early warning systems, preparedness, and flood resilience, leading to more effective flood risk management and reduced impacts on communities.}

abstract = {The UK has set plans to increase offshore wind capacity from 22GW to 154GW by 2030. With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new ‘symbiotic digital architecture’ to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.}

In the information age, especially in the era of big data, safety information is an essential strategy for safety, and safety informatics has become a major research interest and a popular issue in the field of safety science. In recent years, safety informatics—a new area of safety science—has received increasing attention, developing greatly with successful research on the subject. The three key purposes of this paper are: (i) to analyze the historical development of safety informatics, (ii) to review the research progress of safety informatics, and (iii) to review limitations and propose future directions in the field of safety informatics. First, the development process of safety informatics is divided into four typical stages: (i) the embryonic stage (1940–1980), (ii) the initial stage (1980–1990), (iii) the formation stage (1990–2010), and (iv) the deepening stage (2010–present). Then, a review of safety informatics research is provided from seven aspects, including: (i) the discipline construction of safety informatics, (ii) theoretical safety information model, (iii) accident causation model from a safety information perspective, (iv) safety management based on safety information, (v) safety big data, (vi) safety intelligence, and (vii) safety information technology.

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

Realistic models of the terrain, of the fire propagation process, and of the UAVs are exploited, together with a model of the wind, to predict wildfire spread and plan accordingly the UAVs motions. Algorithms and models are integrated within a software architecture allowing tests with real and simulated UAVs flying over synthetic wildfires. Results of a mixed-reality test campaign show the ability of the proposed system to effectively map wildfire propagation.}

Collectively, US national parks protect 34 million ha, host more than 300 million visits annually, and serve as one of the world's largest informal education organizations. The pandemic has altered park conditions and operations in a variety of ways. Shifts in operational conditions related to safety issues, reduced staffing, and decreased park revenues have forced managers to make difficult trade-offs among competing priorities. Long-term research and monitoring of the health of ecosystems and wildlife populations have been interrupted. Time-sensitive management practices, such as control of invasive plants and restoration of degraded habitat, have been delayed. And public engagement has largely shifted from in-person experiences to virtual engagement through social media and other online interactions. These changes pose challenges for accomplishing important science, management, and public engagement goals, but they also create opportunities for developing more flexible monitoring programs and inclusive methods of public engagement. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for strategic science, management planning, flexible operations, and online public engagement to help managers address rapid and unpredictable challenges.}

SOC operators are charged with detection, response, and mitigation. This is a tall task when one considers the volume, velocity, and variety of both internal and external organizational network and system data. SOC operations are truly a big data problem. Security orchestration, incident event management, data fusion, and anomaly detection systems help, but more is needed. This study examines the impact virtual reality (VR) can have on SOC operator performance and perceived task load. We developed a VR based network monitoring tool and assigned human subjects to one of three conditions – VR only, traditional tool only, or both. Our results, though small in scale, provide very promising indication that VR based technology may be beneficial for improving cyber situational awareness (SA), particularly with overall data perception involving novice SOC operators. The results are promising, but the sample size is small, so future research should validate this pilot study. Given the workforce challenges in the cybersecurity space, and the need to perceive large quantities of data, VR may be a very good addition to SOCs.}

The video streams are collected through the monocular camera and navigation relied on the state-of-the-art indoor/outdoor Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system. It implements the robotic operating system (ROS) and computer vision algorithm to provide a robust, accurate and unique inter-frame motion estimation. The collected onboard data are communicated to the ground station and used the SLAM system to generate a map of the environment. A robust and efficient re-localization was performed to recover from tracking failure, motion blur, and frame lost in the data received. The fire detection algorithm was deployed based on the color, movement attributes, temporal variation of fire intensity and its accumulation around a point. The cumulative time derivative matrix was utilized to analyze the frame-by-frame changes and to detect areas with high-frequency luminance flicker (random characteristic). Color, surface coarseness, boundary roughness, and skewness features were perceived as the quadrotor flew autonomously within the clutter and congested area. Mixed Reality system was adopted to visualize and test the proposed system in a physical environment, and the virtual simulation was conducted through the Unity game engine. The results showed that the UAV could successfully detect fire and flame, autonomously fly towards and hover around it, communicate with the ground station and simultaneously generate a map of the environment. There was a slight error between the real and virtual UAV calibration due to the ground truth data and the correlation complexity of tracking real and virtual camera coordinate frames.}

Various parties are using this limitation to distribute problematic content such as fake news, copy-righted material, and propaganda videos. Recent advances in machine learning techniques have shown great promise in extracting content fingerprints from encrypted traffic captured at the various points in IP core networks. Nonetheless, content fingerprinting from listening to encrypted wireless traffic remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in distinguishing re-transmissions and multiple flows on the same link. In this paper, we show the potential of fingerprinting internet traffic by passively sniffing WiFi frames in air, without connecting to the WiFi network by leveraging deep learning methods. First, we show the possibility of building a generic traffic classifier using a hierarchical approach that is able to identity most common traffic types in the Internet and reveal fine-granular details such as identifying the exact content of the traffic. Second, we demonstrate the possibility of using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify streaming traffic, such as video and music, from a closed set, by sniffing WiFi traffic that is encrypted at both Media Access Control (MAC) and Transport layers. Overall, our results demonstrate that we can achieve over 95% accuracy in identifying traffic types such as web, video streaming, and audio streaming as well as identifying the exact content consumed by the user.}

Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.}

abstract = {Background
The likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is influenced by unmodifiable (gender, aetiology, location, the presence of witnesses and initial rhythm) and modifiable factors (bystander CPR and the time to EMS arrival). All of these have been included in the ROSC After Cardiac Arrest (RACA) score.
Purpose
To test the ability of the RACA score to predict the probability of ROSC in two different regions with different local resuscitation networks: the Swiss Canton Ticino and the Italian Province of Pavia.
Methods and Results
All OHCAs occurred between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017 were included. The original regression coefficients for all RACA score variables were applied. The probability to obtain the ROSC as measured with the RACA score was divided in tertiles. Overall, 2041 OHCAs were included in the analysis. The RACA score showed good discrimination for ROSC (AUC 0.76) and calibration, without interaction (p 0.28) between the region and the probability of ROSC. The probability of ROSC was 15% for RACA scores <0.28, 20% for RACA scores between 0.28 and 0.42, increasing to 55% for RACA scores >0.42.
Conclusions
The application of the RACA score reliably assess the probability to obtain the ROSC, with equal effectiveness in the two regions, despite different organization of the resuscitation network. Patients with a RACA score >0.42 had more than 50% probability to obtain ROSC.}

abstract = {Authentic learning is an instructional approach that best occurs when the learning activities are set in real-world contexts. The authenticity of the learning experience increases when learning is situated in a context akin to the real world, and realistic learning experiences are created by carefully designing the learning tasks, context, and environment. The fidelity of a learning task's psychological, physical, functional, and social aspects and environment is the design attributes that contribute to the authenticity of the learning experience. The social context, or the social environment during learning, is essential in engaging learners in authentic learning tasks. In this mixed-method study, we investigate whether the collaborative nature of the learning activities, the authentic design of the learning experience and tasks, and the social environment impact the learner's perceptions of their learning experience and confidence in learning transfer. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and then together through triangulation. The findings of this study suggest that learners perceived the tasks and environment as realistic and the learning activities' collaborative aspect as helpful. The authentic learning environment did not significantly impact learners' confidence to transfer. However, the experience led to valuable metacognitive reflection and change in self-efficacy beliefs about their learning and practice needs. This experience may result in better self-regulation in long-term learning. This paper presents the findings of this study and discusses future research implications.}

abstract = {Tree modeling has been a widely-discussed topic in computer graphics. However, with existing methods, the modeling process is occupied with complex data collection and tedious parameter adjustment, lacking a rich sensory modeling experience. In this paper, we propose an approach to sketch-based tree modeling in an immersive virtual reality environment, aiming to lower the difficulty of modeling and enhance the immersion in the designing process. We first present a sketch sampling and points optimization algorithm to obtain the skeleton of the branch in 3D space. As generating geometry along the skeleton, we apply a vector-projection method to fix the branch polygon twisting. Then, we introduce a bidirectional ray-hit algorithm to determine the branch radius as real-time sketching. To generate random twigs on branches, we introduce a twigs generation algorithm based on Perlin noise and the parent branch direction. Finally, we design a series of interactive methods for users to create tree models in a 3D virtual scene with the VR HMD and controller. Experimental results indicate that our approach can accomplish creating realistic tree models in real-time. The interactive and immersive modeling experience enables users to readily convey their ideas on tree structures in a simple and direct way of sketching. Visualizing and modifying the real-time generated branch results can contribute to provoking the inspiration for creation.}

Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, the review delineates the literature landscape, unveiling unmanned vehicles, radars, wireless sensors, smartphones, and Wi-Fi as prominent modalities. Significant challenges include limited actual-physical world validation, on-site deployment logistics, reliance on communication infrastructure, and power consumption. Nevertheless, innovative strategies such as multi-sensory integration and on-site processing using TinyML, exhibit the potential to reduce these limitations, signifying promising opportunities for future research. The conclusions take a practical perspective, excluding less mature technologies unsuited for early physical world implementation, given the prevalence of studies based on unrealistic assumptions—a major criticism of the literature. In terms of contributions, a conceptual framework, the Ground Disaster Information Management System, is introduced. This framework accentuates the importance of emerging technologies and communication protocols for efficient deployment and standardized data exchange. Ultimately, by synthesizing merits, constraints, and knowledge gaps, this review discerns challenges in survivor detection while underscoring technology-driven resolutions to enhance rescue operations. These encompass pragmatic paradigms for sensing, computation, communication, and coordination, targeting device deployment, in-situ sensors, communication systems, multi-sensory modalities, and augmented autonomy.}

Transport medicine requires a complex set of skills including fast-paced medical decision making, in-depth medical knowledge, procedural competence, interpersonal and communication skills, leadership, and professionalism. There has been a call for more training in these areas. Simulation-based training can be a way to acquire these necessary skills and bridge the gap to higher-quality transport care. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel mixed-reality simulation program to enhance medical and communication skills for a pediatric transport team.
Methods
A mixed-reality simulation program using standardized patients portraying family members and high-fidelity manikins to simulate a medical emergency was developed and implemented for a pediatric transport team. Ten nurses, 9 respiratory therapists, and 8 emergency medical technicians participated. Pre-post self-perceptions of skill and program quality were assessed prospectively.
Results
Team members rated the overall program quality highly, with a median 5 on a 5-point Likert scale. There was a statistically significant change in pre- versus postprogram self-perceptions of skill in the areas of communication (premedian = 3 vs. postmedian = 4, 5-point Likert scale, P < .001).
Conclusion
Mixed-reality simulation programs can enhance standard technical skills training by providing an additional relational element. Such programs are translatable to other institutions.}

abstract = {Background
Lack of training contributes to the burden of trauma-related mortality and morbidity in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Educational technologies present a unique opportunity to enhance the quality of trauma training. Therefore, this study reviews current technologies used in trauma courses and evaluates their feasibility for LMICs.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review evaluating the learning outcomes of technology-enhanced training in general trauma assessment, team skills or any procedures covered in the 2020 Advanced Trauma Life Support® program. Based on the Technology-Enhanced Learning criteria, we created and applied a feasibility analysis tool to evaluate the technologies for use in LMICs.
Results
We screened 6471 articles and included 64. Thirty-four (45%) articles explored training in general trauma assessment, 28 (37%) in team skills, and 24 (32%) in procedures. The most common technologies were high-fidelity mannequins (60%), video-assisted debriefing (19%), and low-fidelity mannequins (13%). Despite their effectiveness, high-fidelity mannequins ranked poorly in production, maintenance, cost, and reusability categories, therefore being poorly suited for LMICs. Virtual simulation and digital courses had the best feasibility scores, but still represented a minority of articles in our review.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform a feasibility analysis of trauma training technologies in the LMIC context. We identified that the majority of trauma courses in the literature use technologies which are less suitable for LMICs. Given the urgent need for pediatric trauma training, educators must use technologies that optimize learning outcomes and remain feasible for low-resource settings.

The purpose of this article is to understand why some business ventures into virtual communities fail and others succeed. Why do virtual communities support certain types of business activities and not others? Which firm activities are the best candidates to benefit from being positioned in virtual communities? The theories of social contracts and trust explain how firms can successfully participate in virtual communities. The theories have implications in the context of transaction-oriented, interest-oriented, relationship-oriented, and fantasy-oriented communities. The value chain provides an instructive background to understand which firm activities are candidates for being included in virtual communities. Success in virtual communities depends on an attitude of contribution, dedication of resources, building a critical mass, and matching community and business needs. Because many social technologies are in the disillusionment stage of the hype cycle, further research in the business use of virtual communities is needed to guide business practices as we move to full adoption.}

This study investigates one particular affordance of VR, namely environmental embeddedness, which enables learners to be situated in simulated or imagined settings that contextualize their learning. A sample of 51 university students were administered written learning material in a between-subjects design study, wherein one group read text about sarcoma cancer on a physical pamphlet in the real world, and the other group read identical text on a virtual pamphlet embedded in an immersive VR environment which resembled a hospital room. The study combined advanced EEG measurement techniques, learning tests, and cognitive load measures to compare conditions. Results show that the VR group performed significantly better on a knowledge transfer post-test. However, reading in VR was found to be more cognitively effortful and less time-efficient. Findings suggest the significance of environmental embeddedness for learning, and provide important considerations for the design of educational VR environments, as we remediate learning content from non-immersive to immersive media.}

Increasingly, sensory data techniques are moving towards more dynamic aspects of sensory perception, taking account of the various stages of user-product interactions. Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.
Industrial relevance
The need for sensory evaluation within the food industry is becoming increasingly complex as companies continuously compete for consumer product acceptance in today's highly innovative and global food environment. Recent technological developments in virtual and augmented reality offer the food industry new opportunities for generating more reliable insights into consumer sensory perceptions of food and beverages, contributing to the design and development of new products with optimised consumer benefits. These technologies also hold significant potential for improving the predictive validity of newly launched products within the marketplace.}

The substantial research and the increase in technology readiness levels (TRLs) of graphene-based technologies have led to the adoption of graphene in many industries. Graphene-based wearables are one such technology that involves closer interaction of graphene by the end-user. Despite this, understanding the toxicological risks associated with using graphene-based wearables is still in the fundamental stage. Herein, graphene-based wearables and industrial-scale fabrication techniques for the development of graphene-based wearables are reviewed. The main goal of the review is to initially evaluate the likelihood of user exposure to graphene from the wearable device and the potential health effects. The subsequent health risks based on graphene's physicochemical characteristics are also discussed. A framework to elucidate the risk is presented in terms of crucial exposure routes, possible graphene interactions, recent exposure assessments, detection removal techniques from the human body, and risk management protocols. It is hoped that this review may aid towards establishing a reasonable practice concerning the safe integration of graphene materials into wearables and facilitate their commercialization.}

Developing worldwide LBGs is a challenging task due to the need to deploy game instances in multiple locations, while maintaining the same game balancing, features, and even correlations between locations of the game and the real world. Hence, it is virtually impossible to manually design interactions, challenges, and game scenarios for every place a player is at. As a result, even modern LBGs still present huge balancing differences between regions and avoid exploring the competition between players like other game genres. This work uses Procedural Content Generation to transpose maps of LBGs while focusing on maintaining their game balancing. We convert LBGs into a game model based on a directed weighted graph using information about Points-of-Interest (POIs) around the players’ location. This game model is simplistic and lightweight, which makes it suitable to wearable and IoT devices that are becoming popular among LBGs. Moreover, we use a Genetic Algorithm to generate a corresponding LBG instance with similar game balancing. To validate the proposed approach, we designed four LBGs with distinct features, gameplay, and mechanics, and conducted an experiment that required samples to compare maps generated by the algorithm in different locations. Results indicate that games with similar game balancing score higher and that the number of POIs has a significant impact on the performance of the approach. Finally, we can conclude that this work contributes to improving the development of LBGs by helping to mitigate the challenge of transposing LBGs while maintaining game balancing.}

abstract = {Massive developments in mobile wireless telecommunication networks have been made during the last few decades. At present, mobile users are getting familiar with the latest 5G networks, and the discussion for the next generation of Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks has already been initiated. It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks. This work provides a basis for privacy aspects that will significantly impact peoples’ daily lives when using these future networks.}

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}

abstract = {In this study, a new visual inspection method that can interactively detect and quantify structural defects using an Extended Reality (XR) device (headset) is proposed. The XR device, which is at the core of this method, supports an interactive environment using a holographic overlay of graphical information on the spatial environment and physical objects being inspected. By leveraging this capability, a novel XR-supported inspection pipeline, called eXtended Reality-based Inspection and Visualization (XRIV), is developed. Key tasks supported by this method include detecting visual damage from sensory data acquired by the XR device, estimating its size, and visualizing (overlaying) information on the spatial environment. The crucial step of real-time interactive segmentation—detection and pixel-wise damage boundary refinement—is achieved using a feature Back-propagating Refinement Scheme (f-BRS) algorithm. Then, a ray-casting algorithm is applied to back-project the 2D image pixel coordinates of the damage region to their 3D world coordinates for damage area quantification in real-world (physical) units. Finally, the area information is overlaid and anchored to the scene containing damage for visualization and documentation. The performance of XRIV is experimentally demonstrated by measuring surface structural damage of an in-service concrete bridge with less than 10% errors for two different test cases, and image processing latency of 2–3 s (or 0.5 s per seed point) from f-BRS. The proposed XRIV pipeline underscores the advantages of real-time interaction between expert users and the XR device through immersive visualization so that a human–machine collaborative workflow can be established to obtain better inspection outcomes in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

abstract = {Online virtual learning resources have been available for learning and teaching in forensic science for some years now, but the recent global COVID-19 related periods of irregular lockdown have necessitated the rapid development of these for teaching, learning and CPD activities. However, these resources do need to be carefully constructed and grounded in pedagogic theory to be effective. This article details eXtended Reality (XR) learning and teaching environments to facilitate effective online teaching and learning for forensic geoscientists. The first two case studies discussed in this article make use of Thinglink software to produce virtual learning and teaching XR resources through an internet system, which was delivered to undergraduate students in 2021. Case one details a range of XR virtual laboratory-based equipment resources, providing a consistent, reliable and asynchronous learning and teaching experience, whilst the second case study presents an XR virtual learning applied geophysics resource developed for a 12-week CPD training programme. This programme involves recorded equipment video resources, accompanying datasets and worksheets for users to work through. Both case studies were positively received by learners, but there were issues encountered by learners with poor internet connections or computer skills, or who do not engage well with online learning. A third case study showcases an XR educational forensic geoscience eGame that was developed to take the user through a cold case search investigation, from desktop study through to field reconnaissance and multi-staged site investigations. Pedagogic research was undertaken with user questionnaires and interviews, providing evidence that the eGame was an effective learning and teaching tool. eGame users highly rated the eGame and reported that they raised awareness and understanding of the use of geophysics equipment and best practice of forensic geoscience search phased investigations. These types of XR virtual learning digital resources, whilst costly to produce in terms of development time and staff resource, provide a complementary virtual learning experience to in-situ practical sessions, and allow learners to asynchronously familiarise themselves with equipment, environments and techniques resulting in more efficient use of in situ time. The XR resources also allow learners to reinforce learning post in-situ sessions. Finally, XR resources can provide a more inclusive and authentic experience for learners who cannot attend or complete work synchronously.}

However, UAVs’ limited onboard energy storage necessitates optimized, energy-efficient communication strategies and intelligent energy expenditure to maximize productivity. This work proposes a novel joint optimization model to coordinate charging operations across multiple UAVs functioning as aerial base stations. The model optimizes charging station assignments and trajectories to maximize UAV flight time and minimize overall energy expenditure. By leveraging both static ground base stations and mobile supercharging stations for opportunistic charging while considering battery chemistry constraints, the mixed integer linear programming approach reduces energy usage by 9.1% versus conventional greedy heuristics. The key results provide insights into separating charging strategies based on UAV mobility patterns, fully utilizing all available infrastructure through balanced distribution, and strategically leveraging existing base stations before deploying dedicated charging assets. Compared to myopic localized decisions, the globally optimized solution extends battery life and enhances productivity. Overall, this work marks a significant advance in UAV energy management by consolidating multiple improvements within a unified coordination framework focused on joint charging optimization across UAV fleets. The model lays a critical foundation for energy-efficient aerial network deployments to serve the connectivity needs of the future.}

abstract = {During ship emergencies, a reliable and efficient evacuation system is able to guide passengers to the appropriate muster stations as quickly as possible. The majority of the existing indoor evacuation systems provide emergency guidance for people trapped in general buildings. However, those systems fail to consider the unique challenges of ship passenger evacuation, such as the effect of ship motion on pedestrian motion and the feedback of pedestrian motion on ship inclination state. Consequently, evacuation guidance provided by these schemes may not always be optimal or may even make the evacuation worse due to the differences in the critical factors influencing emergency guiding between land-based buildings and passenger ships. This paper presents a systematic literature overview of recent advances in building evacuation, followed by a description of the challenges unique to evacuating passengers on vessels. Furthermore, the existing ship evacuation research is reviewed from three aspects, i.e., passenger behavior study, ship evacuation optimization, and evaluation of evacuation on passenger ships. A discussion of land-based evacuation schemes and prospects for ship evacuation is also presented.}

This study explores a focal question about how these new characteristics may affect the education and research related to CPS in 2030, the date identified by the United Nations to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development. To this end, first, we have conducted a trend spotting activity, seeking to identify possible influencing factors that may have a great impact on the future of CPS education and research. These factors were clustered in a total of 12 trends – four certainties; namely connectivity, electrification, data and automation – and eight uncertainties; namely intelligence, data ethics, labour market, lifelong learning, higher education, trust in technology, technological development speed, and sustainable development goals. After that, two of the eight uncertainties are identified and used to construct a scenario matrix, which includes four scenarios. These two uncertainties – the so-called strategic uncertainties – are: fulfilment of sustainable development goals and the nature of the technological development, respectively. These two important uncertainties are considered to build the scenarios due to their potential impact on the research and education of CPS. For instance, sustainable development goals are significant targets for many initiatives, organisations and countries. While 2030 is the deadline to achieve these goals, the relationship between the sustainable development goals related to CPS research and education is not studied well. Similarly, the speed of technological development is seen as a driving force behind future CPS. However, the effect of this speed to CPS research and education environment is not known. Different outcomes of the chosen two uncertainties are, then, combined with the remaining trends and uncertainties. Consequently, four scenarios are derived. The Terminator scenario illustrates a dystopian future where profit is the driving force behind technological progress and sustainable development goals are not accomplished. In contrast, The Iron Giant scenario represents the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals where technological development is the force behind the accomplishment of these goals. The scenario called Slow Progress represents a future where gradual technological improvements are present, but sustainability is still not seen as concerning the issue. The Humanist scenario illustrates a future where slow technological development is happening yet sustainable development goals are successfully implemented. Finally, the scenarios are used to initiate discussions by illustrating what the future of research and education could look like and a list of strategies for future CPS research and education environments is proposed. To this end, we invite educators, researchers, institutions and governments to develop the necessary strategies to enable data-orientated, continuous, interdisciplinary, collaborative, ethical, and sustainable research and education by improving digital fluency, advancing digital equality, contributing to new ways of teaching complex thinking, expanding access to learning platforms and preparing next generations to adapt for a rapidly changing future of work conditions.}

Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.}

abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band communication and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been identified as two candidate 6G technologies. While the THz spectrum provides abundant bandwidth for ultra-high rate communication, the UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-ground communications have potentials to address the unique challenges in the THz bands to avoid environmental blockage and facilitate line-of-sight communications that mitigate the high absorption, molecular and path losses. In synergy, these two enablers have the potential to pave the way towards ultra-high rate and reliable wireless connectivity for next-generation networks, particularly for critical scenarios and use cases such as public safety, disaster management and wireless broadband communications, among others. Despite the potentials of THz-UAV communications, there are still several open issues and challenges to address to make the joint THz-UAV operation a viable 6G solution. This survey thus explores some of the recent works on THz-UAV communication and provides an exposition on some of their peculiar aspects.

abstract = {Massive developments in mobile wireless telecommunication networks have been made during the last few decades. At present, mobile users are getting familiar with the latest 5G networks, and the discussion for the next generation of Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks has already been initiated. It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks. This work provides a basis for privacy aspects that will significantly impact peoples’ daily lives when using these future networks.}

We provide two different formulations. In the first formulation, our objective is to maximize the stable throughput of the secondary user subject to Age of Information constraints imposed on the data transmission of the users. While, in the second formulation, we introduce a multi-objective programming approach that investigates the trade-off between the secondary user stable throughput and its Age of Information. Our numerical results characterize the effect of imposing different Age of Information restrictions on the stable throughput region of the network; we show that the stability region, in certain cases, is reduced by only 11% with strict Age of Information restrictions. Our results also investigate the trade-off between the secondary user throughput and the Age of information. Finally, our results show the potential accuracy of the algorithm adopted in this paper to solve the formulated non-linear optimization problems.}

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes. This paper pointed out the current intriguing challenges, canvassed the mitigation techniques, and plausible future research opportunities that may privilege the pursuit of this vision.}

This study aimed to gain a holistic view of the applications of ImTs for OSH training and education. A review of the application of ImTs for OSH training and education is conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach and bibliometric analysis. This resulted in the evaluation of 67 relevant journal articles collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The review revealed that ImTs have been applied for OSH training and education in various industries including transportation, construction, mining, and healthcare. It was also revealed that the OSH hazards addressed by ImT-based training and education include but are not limited to fire, fall, electrical and chemical hazards in order to prevent or reduce injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition, it was revealed that one of the benefits of ImTs for OSH training and education is better retention of concepts when compared to conventional training and education. Challenges associated with the use of ImTs for OSH training and education include insufficient display brightness for users to effectively see virtual objects in a brightly luminated environment. Among the recommendations for future work is research into how to develop effective communication methods between trainers and trainees immersed in a virtual environment for trainers to fully understand the difficulties trainees experience in operating the developed ImT-based platform and provide solutions to such difficulties.}

abstract = {Authentic learning is an instructional approach that best occurs when the learning activities are set in real-world contexts. The authenticity of the learning experience increases when learning is situated in a context akin to the real world, and realistic learning experiences are created by carefully designing the learning tasks, context, and environment. The fidelity of a learning task's psychological, physical, functional, and social aspects and environment is the design attributes that contribute to the authenticity of the learning experience. The social context, or the social environment during learning, is essential in engaging learners in authentic learning tasks. In this mixed-method study, we investigate whether the collaborative nature of the learning activities, the authentic design of the learning experience and tasks, and the social environment impact the learner's perceptions of their learning experience and confidence in learning transfer. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and then together through triangulation. The findings of this study suggest that learners perceived the tasks and environment as realistic and the learning activities' collaborative aspect as helpful. The authentic learning environment did not significantly impact learners' confidence to transfer. However, the experience led to valuable metacognitive reflection and change in self-efficacy beliefs about their learning and practice needs. This experience may result in better self-regulation in long-term learning. This paper presents the findings of this study and discusses future research implications.}

This demands the appraisal of the wireless networks with enhanced properties as next-generation communication systems. Although 5G networks show great potential to support numerous IoE based services, it is not adequate to meet the complete requirements of the new smart applications. Therefore, there is an increased demand for envisioning the 6G wireless communication systems to overcome the major limitations in the existing 5G networks. Moreover, incorporating artificial intelligence in 6G will provide solutions for very complex problems relevant to network optimization. Furthermore, to add further value to the future 6G networks, researchers are investigating new technologies, such as THz and quantum communications. The requirements of future 6G wireless communications demand to support massive data-driven applications and the increasing number of users. Unlike existing works, this paper highlights the recent activities and trends toward 6G technology, network requirement, essential enabling technologies for 6G networks, and a detailed use case analysis between 5G and 6G networks. Moreover, this paper surveys emerging 6G connectivity solutions, such as holographic beamforming, artificial intelligence-enabled IoT networks, edge computing, and backscatter communications to serve smart communities. Furthermore, several future research directions to accomplish 6G-based IoT networks are also highlighted.}

In this view, smart city may be viewed as a – one of its kind – laboratory to query the complex human-computer relationship from a multi-dimensional perspective. By adopting this perspective, this paper queries the existing smart city surveillance systems to identify their key limitations and sources of frequently justified controversies. It is argued that to bypass these – first – the value of mesh-technology should be explored. It is also argued that – second – it is necessary not only to bring citizens back in the discussion on smart city, but also to highlight the mechanisms by means of which they might be involved in the co-design of smart city solutions and in urban decision-making. To bridge these two imperatives, smart city is conceptualized as a smart service system and, consequently, a wireless integrated mesh-technology enhanced (WIMTE) smart city surveillance system is elaborated.}

Digital immersion offers opportunities for people to travel in time, supporting users to experience virtually ancient encounters, space explorations or dangerous natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions. Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse. Although still experimental, Metaverse is expected to revolutionize travel and tourism management and marketing. It empowers destination awareness, positioning and branding, as well as coordination and management, through digital twins. Metaverse provides opportunities to support trip planning, interaction and engagement, effectively transforming consumer behaviour. Visiting and engaging with destinations virtually is expected to motivate real travel, rather than replace it. This paper provides a vision of how Metaverse can revolutionize tourism experiences and transform tourism management and marketing. Drawing on a systematic review of scholarly works, articles from media and industry reports, this study defines and conceptualizes the Metaverse ecosystem for tourism and travel. It explores the foundations of the disruptions that Metaverse brings to tourism destinations and organisations and identifies the building blocks of Metaverse tourism. The study outlines research directions so that the tourism industry can take full advantage of the Metaverse capabilities and opportunities emerging as well as identify challenges for the future.}

Moreover, recent results and industrial proofs of concept show that these technologies demonstrate critical advantages in the industry. Nevertheless, the authoring and editing process of virtual and augmented content remains time-consuming, especially in complex industrial scenarios. While the use of interactive virtual environments through virtual and augmented reality presents new possibilities for many domains, a wider adoption of VR/AR is possible only if the authoring process is simplified, allowing for more rapid development and configuration without the need for advanced IT skills. To meet this goal, this study presents a new framework: INTERVALES. First, framework architecture is proposed, along with its different modules; this study then shows that the framework can be updated by not only IT workers, but also other job experts. The UML data model is presented to format and simplify the authoring processes for both VR and AR. This model takes into account virtual and augmented environments, the possible interactions, and ease operations orchestration. Finally, this paper presents the implementation of an industrial use case composed of collaborative robotic (cobotic) and manual assembly workstations in VR and AR based on INTERVALES data.}

Thus, traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) approaches cannot keep up with rapidly evolving application requirements. This challenge has motivated the adoption of the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept to adapt the automation into network services management. By automating network and service management, ZSM offers efficiency to control network resources and enhance network performance visibility. The ultimate target of the ZSM concept is to enable an autonomous network system capable of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization based on service-level policies and rules without human intervention. Thus, the paper focuses on conducting a comprehensive survey of E2E ZSM architecture and solutions for 5G and beyond networks. The article begins by presenting the fundamental ZSM architecture and its essential components and interfaces. Then, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for key technical areas, i.e., ZSM automation, cross-domain E2E service lifecycle management, and security aspects, are presented. Furthermore, the paper contains a summary of recent standardization efforts and research projects towards the ZSM realization in 5G and beyond networks. Finally, several lessons learned from the literature and open research problems related to ZSM realization are also discussed in this paper.}

Building Sustainability Assessment (BSA) methods are a key tool to evaluate building sustainability, but their use is hindered by the time-consuming assessment process and required data. With the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM), new potentialities have been found, such as continuous data storage and integrated building design. Facing the opportunity to integrate BSA into BIM, this research aims to automate the assessment of a BSA scheme by creating a BIM-based application for the project's early stages. Visual Programming Language (VPL) was used to translate SBToolPT-H criteria requirements into computable rules and create the SBToolBIM application. Results show the feasibility of automating BSA with BIM, by integrating 19 criteria into SBToolBIM and identifying BIM connections for the remaining 6 criteria. The applied procedure has established a novel framework to carry out BSA within the BIM environment in a faster and more reliable way using fewer resources. It offers a decision support tool for the design process able to provide valuable contributions to enhance building sustainability and meet decarbonisation and climate goals.}

E-petitioning, a genre of technology-based collective action tools, makes it possible for members of the public to address government decision makers directly with their requests for policy-related action. In this paper we explore the effects of Twitter, other forms of online media, and television news broadcasts on the accumulation of signatures in e-petitioning. We analyze the case of “Bring Back Our Girls,” a Change.org petition initiated in spring 2014 following the abduction of 276 young female students from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State, Nigeria by heavily armed members of the Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group. The petition targeted government leaders around the world. We found evidence that tweets and certain forms of online media, together with cable news items, are related to the likelihood of individuals to sign an e-petition. The results provide evidence in support of a hybrid media system in which diverse forms of media behave with diverse logics and impacts in their effects on e-petitions.}

abstract = {360-degree video is an immersive technology used in research across academic disciplines. This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}

The research is particularly focused on the landing on unprepared sites in the presence of obstacles and in a degraded visual environment. The goal is to compute a safe flight path in real time that is displayed to the pilot. Several technical components such as a sensor suite to scan the environment, path planning algorithms, head-down and helmet-mounted displays, active inceptors, and the model-based flight control system are set up to form the overall assistance system. Throughout the development, pilot surveys generate requirements to design individual components such as path planning algorithms, or the synthetic view of the helmet-mounted display. Prior surveys accelerate the design and adjustment of the respective components, meaning that the flight tests benefit from well-designed components, minimizing the requirement for further “re-designs”. During ALLFlight, the successfully flight-tested manual landing with path planning and obstacle avoidance in real time for an unknown terrain has been demonstrated. This paper describes each assistance component, the pilot surveys, and the results obtained in almost six years of research.}

From the existing literature, it has been observed that deep learning based techniques are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in ITS which in turns provide unforgettable experience to both the users and drivers. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and their variants are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in modern ITS. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we have reviewed different types of CNN models used in modern ITS for traffic sign recognition, traffic light detection, vehicle classification and pedestrian detection. Various CNN based models and techniques are discussed and compared in comparison to the existing schemes using different performance evaluation metrics.

abstract = {Military Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being increasingly used to provide surveillance and attack capabilities within war zones. At the heart of much of the rhetoric about these aircraft is their supposed ability to enable persistent presence across the battlespace. They are also unique in that they actively distance the aircrew from the aircraft. This paper seeks to question whether this claim to persistent presence can be justified and considers the implications of the distancing of pilot from machine in this. In order to achieve this, the paper focuses upon conceptualising UAVs as assemblages, composed of both human and machine elements. It uses firsthand accounts from a Royal Air Force Reaper UAV aircrew as a basis to analyse the ways in which the deployment of these aircraft in Afghanistan is changing the ways that war is experienced by aerial combatants. It does this through the utilisation of a feminist, embodied geopolitics, refiguring it from a concern with victims of war to argue for its use to understand the micro-scale of how the humans within these UAV assemblages experience combat. This paper thus focuses upon the extent to which the Reaper UAV achieves a persistent presence through analysis of its supposed more-than-human loitering and vision abilities, and the limitations associated with the requirement for a human-in-the loop. The paper contends that although UAVs like the Reaper change the geopolitics of combat, the continuing requirement for the human element of the assemblage restricts their ability to provide persistent presence.}

A database of aviation reports involving laser illumination of flight crewmembers has been established and maintained at the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. A review of recent laser illumination reports was initiated to investigate the significance of these events.
Methods
Reports that involved laser exposures of civilian aircraft in the United States were analyzed for the 13-month period (January 1, 2004, through January 31, 2005).
Results
There were 90 reported instances of laser illumination during the study period. A total of 53 reports involved laser exposure of commercial aircraft. Lasers illuminated the cockpit in 41 (46%) of the incidents. Of those, 13 (32%) incidents resulted in a visual impairment or distraction to a pilot, including 1 incident that reportedly resulted in an ocular injury. Nearly 96% of these reports occurred in the last 3 months of the study period. There were no aviation accidents in which laser light illumination was found to be a contributing factor.
Conclusion
Operational problems have resulted from laser illumination incidents in the national airspace system. Eye care practitioners, to provide effective consultations to their pilot patients, should be familiar with the problems that can occur with laser exposure.}

abstract = {Introduction: One of the primary countermeasures in place to prevent road rule violations is legal enforcement, yet there are numerous applications that can undermine such efforts by notifying drivers of enforcement locations. However, the capabilities of these applications and how they can impact offending behavior is currently unknown. Method: Two studies were conducted to understand which of these applications are being used by drivers and how these applications are impacting road rule violations. Study 1 consisted of a content analysis that involved searching the Google Play Store and Apple iTunes Store for applications that could be used to avoid road rule violations using pre-determined keywords. Meanwhile, Study 2 consisted of 468 licensed Australian drivers (54.5% males) over the age of 17 years (Mage = 35 years) who completed a survey. Results: A total of 73 applications were identified for Study 1, with most of the applications displaying speed camera locations. It was found that applications that notify drivers of traffic enforcement locations are widely prevalent, can be used on a variety of interfaces and include numerous additional features. Study 2 found that those who use the applications were more willing to speed than those who do not use the applications, while there was no difference in phone use while driving between those who do and do not use the applications. Practical Applications: The findings have important implications for stakeholders, policy, and future research. For example, it is suggested that specific functions of these applications need to be regulated to reduce road rule violations and crash risk. Meanwhile, enforcement initiatives need to evolve at a faster rate to keep up to date with the changing technology that can undermine them.}

For better preparation, sharing of resources, engaging the public can make a substantial contribution to these improved community outcomes of disaster resilience through sharing information, identifying problems, and crafting possible solutions collectively. This research develops a framework of a serious game, which is typically used for non-entertainment educational purposes, to harness crowd wisdom and to engage them in facility resilience management. This research first examines traditional methods used in emergency response training, as well as computer simulation-based emergency drills. It next reviews the use of gaming in emergency response training, from board games to computer games utilizing simulation technologies. It is found that alternate reality games, which are driven by transmedia storytelling and intensely devoted to establishing interactions across real and fictional worlds, suit the need of emergency response training best, yet is still lacking. The alternate reality game is designed to provide appropriate challenges that are realistic, and to enhance essential aspects of the player's experience. In the framework, the reality is integrated with virtual game design, and take places offline between play sessions with knowledgeable persons checking the appropriateness of the interface. The alternate reality game is expected to engage facility occupants and to address the need of facility resilience management. Facility management team and emergency management officials are able to gather real-time information about a facility and its occupants. The idea of alternate reality game also has the potential to be applied in other aspects of facility management to achieve a shift from centralized knowledge to a collaborative model that is more adaptive to dynamic situations of a facility.}

This research proposes an information model to facilitate the data flow for post-earthquake assessment of reinforced concrete structures. The schema development was based on typical damage modes and the existing Industry Foundation Class (IFC) schema. Two examples of damaged structures from recent earthquake events, compiled using an experimental damage modeling software, illustrate the use of the data model. The model introduces two new classes, one to represent segments of building elements and the other to model the relationships between segments and cracks. A unique feature is the ability to model the process of damage with a binary tree structure. Methods for exporting as-damaged instance models using IFC are also discussed.}

We provide evidence that intoxicated driving is increasingly responsible for recent increases in fatalities from distracted driving crashes. This study describes trends in deaths on U.S. public roads caused by alcohol-involved and distracted drivers using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)—a census of fatal crashes on U.S. public roads. Fatality rates per vehicle-miles traveled are calculated using data from the Federal Highway Administration. Alcohol-involved drivers who are simultaneously distracted were responsible for 1750 deaths in 2009, an increase of more than 63% from 2005 when there were 1072 deaths. Alcohol use while driving is increasingly responsible for a growing number of fatalities from distracted driving, accounting for 32% of deaths from distracted driving in 2009 versus 24% in 2005. The fatality rate from these crashes increased from 35.9 to 59.2 deaths per 100 billion vehicle-miles traveled after 2005. Alcohol use is quickly increasing as an important factor behind distracted driving fatalities. This has implications for policies combating distracted driving that do not address the role of alcohol use in distracted driving.}

In this study, we investigate the innovations induced by immersive technologies for transportation fields. The literature (153 articles) published over the past five years were collected and analyzed systematically, pertaining to the lifecycle model of the product–service system, i.e., design, development, evaluation, and applications. The review indicated that immersive systems and scenarios have been developed and applied in various transportation areas, such as air traffic management, autonomous vehicles, railways, highways, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, the review indicated that immersive technology brings significant benefits to the transportation field and induces significant changes in the interactions between humans and the physical world. These changes are expected to induce digital transformation in several aspects, e.g., digital testbeds for theoretical models and algorithms, immersive and safe digital environments for user studies, and digital training. Based on the review, a novel framework and conceptual lifecycle model of developing immersive technology-enabled digital transformation in transportation is proposed, a novel evaluation matrix for measuring the immersive experience level is established. The results provide essential references for practitioners to apply immersive technology and guidance regarding potential future research directions.}

Whilst we make several decisions on a daily basis, firefighters in particular are called to make important decisions in a split second and within life-threatening settings. Stress can therefore impact their ability to perform and carry out their job. The implications of stress are similarly important in other settings requiring high-vigilance. In this paper, we aim to contribute to efforts to better train firefighters in decision making in stressful situations through a serious game solution. The game was designed based on the Stress Exposure Training (SET) approach and in accordance with typical stressors identified in the literature. Those were then mapped to relevant game mechanics. The evaluation of the resulting game was twofold: A. to assess its ability to increase participants’ stress level, and B. to investigate whether decision making performance would be improved for participants under stress. The proposed framework and the prototype were evaluated through empirical research that consisted of the participants’ self-reported stress levels using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) and the participants’ physiological measurements, namely galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR). Our results demonstrate the potential of serious games to assist towards training of firefighters to make better decisions under stressful situations. Our findings are of wider importance as they contribute to ongoing efforts to improve decision making under stress in a variety of settings and scenarios.}

However, evolution has led to there being many real animals capable of excellent locomotion. This paper presents a “parasitic robot system” whereby locomotion abilities of an animal are applied to a robot task. We chose a turtle as our first host animal and designed a parasitic robot that can perform “operant conditioning”. The parasitic robot, which is attached to the turtle, can induce object-tracking behavior of the turtle toward a Light Emitting Diode (LED) and positively reinforce the behavior through repeated stimulus-response interaction. After training sessions over five weeks, the robot could successfully control the direction of movement of the trained turtles in the waypoint navigation task. This hybrid animal-robot interaction system could provide an alternative solution to some of the limitations of conventional mobile robot systems in various fields, and could also act as a useful interaction system for the behavioral sciences.}

Therefore, the use of helmet-mounted displays recently became increasingly important for rotary-wing aircraft. To assist pilots in degraded visual environment, new HMD symbology designs were developed at the DLR Institute of Flight Guidance. They were tested in a simulator study with 18 civil and military helicopter pilots and compared to a state-of-the art PFD/ND test condition. Concurrent task performance was investigated, which included the detection and identification of targets in the environment. Hit rate was analyzed as a function of display type, visibility, target type, and the presence or absence of cueing. Moreover, differences between pilot experience and operational area were assessed. Results revealed a significant HMD detection cost for un-cued targets compared to when no symbology was presented. In contrast, cueing significantly increased hit rate, resulting in substantial HMD benefits when proper attentional guidance was provided.}

SOC operators are charged with detection, response, and mitigation. This is a tall task when one considers the volume, velocity, and variety of both internal and external organizational network and system data. SOC operations are truly a big data problem. Security orchestration, incident event management, data fusion, and anomaly detection systems help, but more is needed. This study examines the impact virtual reality (VR) can have on SOC operator performance and perceived task load. We developed a VR based network monitoring tool and assigned human subjects to one of three conditions – VR only, traditional tool only, or both. Our results, though small in scale, provide very promising indication that VR based technology may be beneficial for improving cyber situational awareness (SA), particularly with overall data perception involving novice SOC operators. The results are promising, but the sample size is small, so future research should validate this pilot study. Given the workforce challenges in the cybersecurity space, and the need to perceive large quantities of data, VR may be a very good addition to SOCs.}

Such datasets are usually collected in real-time at the incident scenes using different Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hierarchical clouds, i.e., core and edge clouds, can help these applications’ real-time data orchestration challenges as well as with their IoT operations scalability, reliability and stability by overcoming infrastructure limitations at the ad-hoc wireless network edge. Routing is a crucial infrastructure management orchestration mechanism for such systems. Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose. In this paper, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI)-augmented geographic routing approach, that relies on an area knowledge obtained from the satellite imagery (available at the edge cloud) by applying deep learning. In particular, we propose a stateless greedy forwarding that uses such an environment learning to proactively avoid the local minimum problem by diverting traffic with an algorithm that emulates electrostatic repulsive forces. In our theoretical analysis, we show that our Greedy Forwarding achieves in the worst case a 3.291 path stretch approximation bound with respect to the shortest path, without assuming presence of symmetrical links or unit disk graphs. We evaluate our approach with both numerical and event-driven simulations, and we establish the practicality of our approach in a real incident-supporting hierarchical cloud deployment to demonstrate improvement of application level throughput due to a reduced path stretch under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios.}

Our work presents the primary thorough forensic analysis of the DJI Phantom III drone, and the primary account for proprietary file structures stored by the examined drone. It also presents the forensically sound open source tool DRone Open source Parser (DROP) that parses proprietary DAT files extracted from the drone's nonvolatile internal storage. These DAT files are encrypted and encoded. The work also shares preliminary findings on TXT files, which are also proprietary, encrypted, encoded, files found on the mobile device controlling the drone. These files provided a slew of data such as GPS locations, battery, flight time, etc. By extracting data from the controlling mobile device, and the drone, we were able to correlate data and link the user to a specific device based on extracted metadata. Furthermore, results showed that the best mechanism to forensically acquire data from the tested drone is to manually extract the SD card by disassembling the drone. Our findings illustrated that the drone should not be turned on as turning it on changes data on the drone by creating a new DAT file, but may also delete stored data if the drone's internal storage is full.}

Based on the exhaustive analysis of the research work, this work concludes that there is a need for zooming out strategy, where the novel architectural, technological, and AI-based solution approaches are crafted by capturing the end-to-end system with the focus on most (if not all) stakeholders and their objectives.}

abstract = {This study analyzed factors affecting behavior of mobile phone use while driving and its effects on driving performance, in terms of speed, lateral position, steer deviation, steer speed, following distance, perception–reaction time, and occurrence of a near miss situation. To investigate the factors affecting behavior of mobile phone use while driving, 1106 respondents from four different regions in Thailand participated in the questionnaire survey study. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to explain these factors including two additional extended factors which are risk perception and law enforcement knowledge. The outcome of this part shows that attitude, norm, and law enforcement knowledge significantly affect the intention and behavior of the drivers. Even though approximately 90 percent of drivers realized that using a mobile phone while driving was dangerous and against the law, they have reported that they still use mobile phone while driving. To determine the effect of mobile phone use on driving performance, a 2-lane, straight rural highway, with a leading vehicle and an unexpected “STOP” sign, were simulated in order to examine the driving performance of drivers “without a phone”, “talking on a phone call”, and “texting a message” conditions. The results found that using mobile phone while driving can reduce speed and following distance, but increase lateral deviation, steer deviation, steer speed, perception-reaction time, and number of near misses leading to higher risks for road crashes.}

This paper showcases the usefulness of using a mixed-method focus group study of first responders to examine the design of a hand-held radiation detector. The study used a survey and a semi-structured script that explored five main topics: difficulties of using radiation detection with respect to the equipment and environment; preferences for handle design; preferences for control design; preferences for screen, menu, and interface design, and instructional and maintenance issues. The focus group indicated a desire for fewer and bigger buttons to control the device, a desire for a san serif font type for the display, a request to minimize the use of abbreviations and symbols in the text display, having a color coding display bar to describe radiation levels, and a need for detailed maintenance procedures and processes. These results provide important feedback for planning the development and testing of a more ergonomic radiation detector.
Relevance to industry
A hand-held radiation detector to test for fissionable materials is one of the essential tools used by first responders. This paper presents the results from a focus group of first responders exploring characteristics for a more ergonomic detector.}

On-bike human–machine interfaces (HMIs) and connecting cyclists to AVs and the road infrastructure may have the potential to enhance the safety of cyclists. This study aimed to identify cyclists’ needs in today’s and future traffic, and explore on-bike HMI functionality and the implications of equipping cyclists with devices to communicate with AVs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 cyclists in Norway and 15 cyclists in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors of cyclist-AV interaction and on-bike HMIs. From the analysis, seven themes were identified: Interaction, Bicycles, Culture, Infrastructure, Legislation, AVs, and HMI. These themes are diverse and overlap with factors grouped in sub-themes. The results indicated that the cyclists prefer segregated future infrastructure, and in mixed urban traffic, they need confirmation of detection by AVs. External on-vehicle or on-bike HMIs might be solutions to fulfil the cyclists’ need for recognition. However, the analysis suggested that cyclists are hesitant about being equipped with devices to communicate with AVs: Responsibility for safety should lie with AV technology rather than with cyclists. A device requirement might become a barrier to cycling, as bicycles are traditionally cheap and simple, and additional costs might deter people from choosing cycling as a transport mode. Future studies should investigate user acceptance of on-bike HMIs among cyclists on a larger scale to test the findings’ generalisability, and explore other, perhaps more viable solutions than on-bike HMIs for enhancing AV-cyclist interaction.}

The widespread reliance on motor vehicles has negative effects on both the environment and human health. The development of an innovative in-vehicle human-machine interface (HMI) has the potential to contribute to reducing traffic pollution and road trauma.
Aim
A qualitative study, using a driver-centred design approach, was carried out to test how best to provide ecological and safe (eco-safe) driving advice and feedback to drivers on their driving style via an in-vehicle HMI.
Method
A total of 34 drivers (52.9% males), aged 19–61years, participated in focus groups which explored concepts from the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989).
Findings
Main themes emerging from the focus groups were: (i) perceived importance of eco-safe driving behaviour; (ii) perceived usefulness of eco-safe in-vehicle HMIs; (iii) intentions to use an eco-safe in-vehicle HMI; (iv) perceptions toward eco-safe in-vehicle HMI design characteristics; and (v) potential problems associated with using eco-safe in-vehicle HMIs.
Implications
This study provides the foundation to inform the design and development of an evidence-based in-vehicle eco-safe HMI with high levels of driver acceptance. Recommendations for future research are also discussed.}

Many of these situations can be safely simulated for training purposes in the real world. Radiological threats, however, are difficult to simulate due to the lack of materials that can mimic radiation sources without the danger of the real radiation. To address the need for a system to train CSTs to respond to radiological threats, we have developed the Radiological Immersive Survey Training (RIST) system. RIST simulates radiological threats from multiple sources using a realistic real-time shielding model based on ray casting and allows users to practice surveying the threat using simulated representations of the world and equipment. We have developed an after action review tool to allow a trainer to show trainees a recording of their survey and how they can improve. We also created a scenario design tool to allow the trainer to create complex environments with radiological threats. We developed novel multi-user interaction techniques to enable simultaneous training for two CST members in an immersive virtual environment. We also introduced a novel multi-perspective rendering technique for two users based on each user's task rather than field of view. Finally, we conducted a preliminary user study with several pairs of expert users to measure user preferences and the effects of using this technique, in conjunction with how altering which user navigated, on user performance. CST survey teams from two states have now used the system for training.}

The lack of predictive safety systems that notify workers of upcoming dangers in advance is a major reason to blame in the highway maintenance and operation community. This article presents an integrative design framework for bringing recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the safety of highway workers through real-time multimodal notifications on-spot. To this end, this article conceptualizes and co-designs three major pillars: (1) AR user interface design for multimodal notification, (2) real-time AI at the edge for vehicle detection/classification from distance, and (3) real-time wireless communication in work zone setting to enable latency-aware operation between AI and AR components. Our early results demonstrate that we can achieve 24.83 FPS end-to-end execution latency on the Xavier AGX Jetson board with 48.7% mAP on BDD100K dataset, and a real-time communication covering 120 meters with an average latency of 5.1 ms at the farthest distance. Our mixed-method user research also reveals an acceptable level of excitement and engagement from the body of highway workers toward both the proposed technology and the designed user interface. Overall, this article provides a proof-of-concept toward AI-enabled AR safety systems in highway work zones.}

It is dependent on local data communications from its onboard sensors and to its onboard effectors, and on telecommunications links over which it receives data-feeds and command-feeds from terrestrial and perhaps airborne sources and from satellites. A drone acts on the world, and is therefore a robot. The remote pilots, and the operators of drone facilities such as cameras, depend on high-tech tools that interpret data that display transmitted, enhanced and generated image and video, and that enable the composition of commands. So drone operators are already cyborgs. Many drones carry cameras and are used for surveillance. Computing, data communications, robotics, cyborgisation and surveillance offer power and possibilities, but with them come disbenefits and risks. Critical literatures exist in relation to all of those areas. An inspection of those literatures should provide insights into the limitations of drones, and the impacts and implications arising from their use.}

During this phase, system designers need to accurately elicit, model and validate the desired system based on user requirements. Smart driver assistive technologies (SDAT) belong to a class of complex systems that are used to alleviate accident risk by improving situation awareness, reducing driver workload or enhancing driver attentiveness. Such systems aim to draw drivers’ attention on critical information cues that improve decision making. Discovering the requirements for such systems necessitates a holistic approach that addresses not only functional and non-functional aspects but also the human requirements such as drivers’ situation awareness and workload. This work describes a simulation-based user requirements discovery method. It utilizes the benefits of a modular virtual reality simulator to model driving conditions to discover user needs that subsequently inform the design of prototype SDATs that exploit the augmented reality method. Herein, we illustrate the development of the simulator, the elicitation of user needs through an experiment and the prototype SDAT designs using UNITY game engine.}

Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept.

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

By 2030, a 50% rise in lighting demand of the existing consumption is projected due to an increase in the global population. To address the concern of rising lighting electricity consumption, the key strategy is to develop and provide energy efficient lighting products to consumers. In this respect, the Solid-State Lighting (SSL) has the potential to offer power efficiencies that are superior to those of conventional lighting sources. Recently, white organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have emerged as the leading technology for the new display and lighting market which has attracted substantial attention of manufacturers, product designers, and end users. OLED devices have already entered into high end lighting markets such as designer, automotive, aerospace, high-end architectural lighting, and other applications. Moreover, innovative flexible OLED devices are thought to be candidates for the next-generation SSL systems, wearable electronics, mobile devices, microdisplays, etc. as they are lighter, thinner and more durable compared to glass (rigid) based devices. In the present review, distinctive features of OLEDs SSL lighting, technical requirements of lighting for applications, OLED basic, and classification of OLED devices, including quantum dot (QD) OLEDs (QLED) as well as the need of development of OLEDs standards are discussed. Various constituents of flexible OLED lighting, OLED lighting panels by some manufacturers, hurdles in OLED lighting technologies, performance of OLEDs in harsh conditions, challenges in flexible OLEDs, OLED lighting technology comparison, OLED lighting roadmap, and future directions including cost reduction analysis, flexible OLED incorporated into automotive, IoT (Internet of Things) connected lighting system, OLED market projections, etc. are also presented. It is suggested that the white OLEDs, and flexible OLEDs in particular, lighting products have potential to revolutionize the future of lighting systems, industries, and the market.}

In recent times aviation, communication, medicine, and information dissemination have had major impetus from military research and development funding agencies. Widespread nonmilitary use of a technology can also lower costs sufficiently to make its large-scale integration into military systems feasible. For several decades, the military has employed thermoelectrics (TE) modules in a number of niche applications, and that continues to be the case. However, the number and importance of the niches is growing with the increasing technological sophistication of war fighting, and this is bound to continue. The United States Marines and Army Rangers go into combat carrying more weight in batteries than in munitions. The chapter discusses that sensors are needed for the remarkably small-caliber “smart” munitions that forward-looking research now envisions. It seems inevitable that more energy harvesting and sensor cooling is needed. The TE knowledge base and cadre of experts developed in the scientific community by the recent surge in military-funded TE research should prove to be a national asset in meeting these needs.}

abstract = {Recent research indicates that driver error contributes to up to 75% of all roadway crashes. Despite this, only relatively little is currently known about the types of errors that drivers make and of the causal factors that contribute to these errors being made. This article presents an overview of the literature on human error in road transport. In particular, the work of three pioneers of human error research, Norman, Reason and Rasmussen, is scrutinised. An overview of the research on driver error follows, to consider the different types of errors that drivers make. It was found that all but one of these does not use a human error taxonomy. A generic driver error taxonomy is therefore proposed based upon the dominant psychological mechanisms thought to be involved. These mechanisms are: perception, attention, situation assessment, planning, and intention, memory and recall, and action execution. In addition, a taxonomy of road transport error causing factors, derived from the review of the driver error literature, is also presented. In conclusion to this article, a range of potential technological solutions that could be used to either prevent, or mitigate, the consequences of the driver errors identified are specified.}

keywords = {Army personnel, Dry eye, Exercise-induced changes, Ocular physiology, Tear osmolarity},
abstract = {Purpose
Fitness level modulates the physiological responses to exercise for a variety of indices. While intense bouts of exercise have been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity (Tosm), it is not known if fitness level can affect the Tosm response to acute exercise. This study aims to compare the effect of a maximal incremental test on Tosm between trained and untrained military helicopter pilots.
Methods
Nineteen military helicopter pilots (ten trained and nine untrained) performed a maximal incremental test on a treadmill. A tear sample was collected before and after physical effort to determine the exercise-induced changes on Tosm.
Results
The Bayesian statistical analysis demonstrated that Tosm significantly increased from 303.72 ± 6.76 to 310.56 ± 8.80 mmol/L after performance of a maximal incremental test. However, while the untrained group showed an acute Tosm rise (12.33 mmol/L of increment), the trained group experienced a stable Tosm physical effort (1.45 mmol/L). There was a significant positive linear association between fat indices and Tosm changes (correlation coefficients [r] range: 0.77–0.89), whereas the Tosm changes displayed a negative relationship with the cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2 max; r = −0.75) and performance parameters (r = −0.75 for velocity, and r = −0.67 for time to exhaustion).
Conclusions
The findings from this study provide evidence that fitness level is a major determinant of Tosm response to maximal incremental physical effort, showing a fairly linear association with several indices related to fitness level. High fitness level seems to be beneficial to avoid Tosm changes as consequence of intense exercise.}

Efforts for developing sense through the wall (STTW) systems, such as those undertaken by the US Army Technology Objective (ATO) program, aim at providing the soldier with situational awareness information before breaching a building in a military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) environment. STTW capabilities also support law enforcement and search and rescue applications. Since 2002, extensive evaluations of STTW technologies, most notably those performed by the Communications Electronics, Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), have been made to determine which technology could be the most viable solution. After conducting comprehensive studies, I2WD initiated several Phase I efforts and Phase II efforts. The purpose behind both efforts was to develop various STTW technology demonstrators under a 5 year ATO. Many lessons learned during the development of Phase I systems were incorporated into the considerations for Phase II developments. This paper discusses design challenges and issues with sensing through walls at different standoff distances and wall types through lessons learned and results from modeling and simulations performed by the Army Research Laboratory.}

Method: Previous analyses of the relationships between functional capacity measures and at-fault crash involvement for older drivers as reported in the NHTSA Model Driver Screening and Evaluation Program Final Technical Report have been updated to include one additional year of driving experience. Eighteen new at-fault crashes involving drivers who previously had no crash involvement were recorded for the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) test sample during this interval. The method of odds ratio (OR) calculation was used to examine the relationships between functional status predictors and the most salient among the safety outcome measures identified in the Maryland research. Peak valid OR values for the prior and current analyses were contrasted, and the stability of candidate pass–fail cut-points for each predictor relative to values identified in the Final Technical Report was examined. Results: Results indicate that the predictive value of functional tests appears to decrease over time, particularly for the perceptual–cognitive measures. Impact on Industry: The impact of these findings on programs and policies is to underscore a need for periodic reevaluation, spaced at the shortest practical intervals but not more than 2 years apart, in order for functional capacity screening to be applied effectively by licensing authorities, health care professionals, and others to reduce personal risk and enhance public safety.}

Firstly, the time distribution characteristics, country distribution, institution distribution and main source journal distribution of published articles were explored. Then, by using the CiteSpace and VOSviewer software, cited reference co-citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis and burst detection analysis were carried out respectively to visually explore the knowledge base, research topic, research frontier and development trend of this field. The results indicate that the USA, Australia and China are the three most active countries in the studies of driving behavior active intervention. Accidental Analysis & Prevention, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behavior, and Journal of Safety Research are widely selected journals for publications related to this field. The research frontiers in the field of driving behavior active intervention focus on: “traffic safety and crashes analysis, as well as enforcement intervention”, “driving risk and education for young drivers”, “information provision and driving behavior”, “workload and situation awareness for automated driving”. It is worth noting that in recent years, “warning system”, “time”, “work load” have become research hotspots in this field. To sum up, by a bibliometric overview of research on driving behavior active intervention over the past thirty years, this paper clarifies the development skeleton of this research field, determines its hot topics and research progress, and provides a reference for the follow-up exploratory scientific research in this field.}

abstract = {Objective
We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance.
Background
Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity.
Method
Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone.
Results
In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate.
Conclusion
Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance.
Application
The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance.
Précis
High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

Understanding, predicting and suppressing these inadvertent and sustained aircraft oscillations, known as aircraft (rotorcraft)-pilot couplings (A/RPCs) is a challenging problem for the designers. The goal of the present paper is to give an overview on the state-of-the-art in RPC problem, underlining the future challenges in this field. It is shown that, exactly as in the case of fixed wing APCs, RPCs existed from the beginning of rotorcraft development and that the problem of eliminating them is not yet solved: the current rotorcraft modelling for RPC analysis is rather limited to the particular case analysed and there is a lack of quantitative pilot behavioural models to analyse RPCs. The paper underlines the importance of involuntary pilot control actions, generally attributed to biodynamic couplings in predicting RPCs in rotorcraft. It is also shown that recent experiences demonstrate that modern rotorcraft seem to embed tendencies predisposing the flight control system FCS system towards dangerous RPCs. As the level of automation is likely to increase in future designs, extending to smaller aircraft and to different kinds of operation, the consequences of the pilot ‘fighting’ the FCS system and inducing A/RPCs needs to be eradicated. In Europe, the ARISTOTEL project (2010–2013) has been launched with the aim of understanding and predicting modern aircraft's susceptibility to A/RPC. The present paper gives an overview of future challenges to be solved for RPC-free design and some new solutions herein.}

abstract = {Training in enclosure fires is essential because it is one of the most dangerous tasks for firefighters. The training simulators should consider the specificity of the tasks performed to achieve the best training outcomes. Additionally, the end-users may not accept even the best technical solutions. Due to the availability of many different interfaces and methods (e.g., for image presentation), end-users' opinions are essential in choosing the best possible technologies. In this research, the aim is to create and compare two realistic virtual training systems for fighting enclosure fires, CAVE (Cave Automated Virtual Environment) with projectors and VR (Virtual Reality) with HMD (Head Mounted Display). Both focused on nozzle person training to fill the gap between theoretical training and real-life training with fires (e.g., drills with class A fuels). Efforts were made to minimize the disadvantages of training simulators while maintaining high simulation realism and low simulator cost. The study was conducted with the participation of 67 cadets and seven active firefighters. The method of reducing the limitations of VR training simulators while maintaining relatively low costs is discussed. The simulator enables multisensory experience with passive haptic and multi-user interaction considering the sense of touch. The VR simulator was rated better than the CAVE simulator, but both were accepted and rated as very useful. The paper also discusses the issues of simulation sickness symptoms, simulation realism (spatial presence), usability, acceptance of technology, and stress associated with using a training simulator.}

The education sector has benefited from this ICT-driven revolution, which has provided and expanded multiple new tools and teaching methods that did not exist just a few decades ago. In light of this technological change, virtual laboratories (VLs) based on the use of virtual reality (VR) have emerged, which are increasingly used to facilitate the teaching–learning process in a wide range of training activities, both academic and professional types. The set of advantages offered by this type of VL, the main of which are listed in this article, has made its use increasingly common as support for engineering classes at universities. This paper presents a study involving 420 engineering students from Spanish and Portuguese universities and associated analyses on the assessment of different parameters in various VLs designed by the authors. The results obtained indicate that, in general, VR-based VLs are widely accepted and demanded by students, who likewise consider real laboratories (RLs) necessary in face-to-face teaching. In the current post-COVID-19 educational scenario, VLs and RLs will coexist within the new hybrid models that combine face-to-face and online teaching and learning.}

Different forms of wearables have a wide range of power requirements, and lithium-ion batteries are now the most popular energy storage option. This paper discusses the trends and challenges of smart wearables. Future wearable technology will be more compact and integrated. For the specificity of future wearables, new energy harvesting technologies that are more practical, durable, and ecologically beneficial are needed. This paper summarizes the research on the human body and environment based energy harvesting techniques, including solar, thermal, Radio frequency (RF) energy, kinetic energy, and biomass energy. We deeply analyze the application potential and limitations of each new energy harvesting technology and summarize the relationship between the energy required by wearables and the new energy harvesting systems. Solar and kinetic energy generation technologies have higher energy density and are suitable for application in outdoor sports wearables. RF energy, thermal energy, and biomass energy have less energy dense and can be used as auxiliary power sources for small wearables. The combination of the energy harvesting system and the micro energy storage unit enables the continuous power supply of wearables in different circumstances of daytime, nighttime, indoor and outdoor. The significance of this work stems from providing guidance for future energy supply methods of wearables.}

The VE is made walkable with an omni-directional treadmill, and the behaviours are videotaped for later analysis. The analysed behaviours are quadratically regressed on the clarity-intensity plane, and it is discovered 1) that the delay time is effectively reduced with high clarity, and appears an inverted U-shape on the intensity dimension, and 2) that the stride frequency ratio, which represents the speed preference, rises with both clarity and intensity. The results on the delay time are further compared with a dormitory building fire case, and consistency is concluded.}

Despite the emphasis on early evacuation as the safest option, there are circumstances when staying and defending a property is a rational decision. Using the protective action decision model (PADM), this study aimed to: (1) increase understanding of the relative importance of bushfire risk perception, protective action perception, and stakeholder perception in predicting the intention to ‘stay and defend’ and (2) analyse the effect of a virtual reality (VR) intervention on these factors among South Australian residents (n = 299). Prior to the VR intervention, participants were grouped into three cohorts of ‘stay and defend’, ‘leave early’ and ‘wait and see’ based on their preferred protective action on a day forecast as a day of severe fire danger. The participants who either indicated they would ‘stay and defend’ or ‘wait and see’ experienced the intervention which challenged their capacity to ‘stay and defend’ using a virtual bushfire threat. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis of data showed that protective action perception was the strongest predictor of the intention to stay and defend for all cohorts. Self-efficacy was found to have a mediating role between risk perception and the intention to stay and defend. For those intending to ‘stay and defend’, stakeholder perception was not a significant predictor, however, its importance amongst all three groups significantly increased after exposure to the virtual bushfire experience. Understanding the differences in the decision-making process of the three cohorts and the way they were influenced by the virtual scenario provides valuable insights that could contribute to the design of more effective bushfire risk communication strategies.}

Within the cultural heritage sector, the use of 3D data is becoming more established to aid conservation. However, little work has been done to investigate the role of scanning surveys for postfire inspection of historic buildings with timber components. The Glasgow School of Art and Historic Environment Scotland have been working collaboratively on digital heritage projects for almost a decade. When the fire at the Mackintosh building occurred on 23rd May 2014, the joint team immediately began a programme of emergency 3D digital documentation in the fire-affected areas. Prior to this, The Glasgow School of Art had undertaken a laser scan survey of the exterior of the Mackintosh building in 2008. Subsequently, comprehensive laser scanning has been carried out throughout the whole building. This paper outlines how and why 3D digital documentation was carried out, highlighting the immediate benefits for disaster management and immediate decision making in an emergency situation and additionally, demonstrates the ongoing research benefits for the longer-term conservation and restoration of the Mackintosh. The results of the documentation produced an accurate and high-resolution 3D spatial record of a significant historic building despite the challenging material properties of the postfire interior environment. Analysis of the data provided conservation teams and building control with valuable metrics for building access, health and safety and structural deformation.}

Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been increasingly used as a promising training method in many applications including emergency preparedness. However, previous studies for active shooter incidents have mainly focused on developing VR-based training prototypes. Thus, the effectiveness of VR-based training for active shooter incidents has yet to be rigorously studied. This study focuses on the effectiveness of VR-based training for active shooter preparedness compared to traditional training methods and investigates the factors behind the improved performance. To study the effectiveness of VR-based training, a total of 108 participants were recruited to experience video-based training, VR-based training with low interactivity, and VR-based training with high interactivity. Both objective and subjective measures were assessed. The results show that VR-based training is more effective than video-based training in improving participants’ response performance and perceived preparedness for active shooter incidents. The immersion and interactivity of the VR-based training contribute to performance. Participants without previous training experience benefit more from VR-based training than participants who previously had received some training to prepare for active shooter incidents.}

This study investigates associations between HEXACO personality traits and burglars' scouting process, as well as how burglars differ in this respect from non-offenders due to their unique burglary expertise. In a virtual reality experiment, 181 incarcerated burglars and 172 non-offenders (university students) were asked to scout two virtual neighbourhoods for potential targets. For burglars, two main findings were observed: (1) lower honesty-humility was associated with increased perceived neighbourhood deterrence and the perceived likelihood of residents intervening, and (2) higher honesty-humility and self-control, but lower conscientiousness were all associated with taking less time scouting and travelling less distance in the virtual neighbourhood as well as target selection (e.g., selecting corner houses). For non-offenders, only extraversion emerged as a trait associated with increased efficiency in scouting the neighbourhood. We conclude that honesty-humility, conscientiousness, and self-control are primarily associated with the burglar scouting process, and suggest that burglary expertise is key to explaining why these effects were only observed for burglars rather than non-offenders.}

To assess the method, a virtual reality scenario based on the conditions in a hotel room during the MGM Grand fire in 1980 was created, and 55 naïve participants were exposed to it. Their behavior was later compared to that of the survivors of the real fire. The results show that the virtual environment made approximately 50% of the participants feel urgency due to the emergency and act on it. A comparison to the data from the MGM Grand fire confirmed that real life behavior can be observed in the virtual environment, although the frequencies of actions performed were lower in the virtual reality experiments.}

The dexterity measures involved in controlling input modalities could pose challenges to users with motor disabilities—including the inability to move their limbs, particularly their upper and lower arms, and fingers, due to traumatic damage or congenital problems. In order to meet these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual reality (VR)-based medium to help users with motor disabilities build simple 3D models for architectural design. The concept of operating buttons using head-gaze in the VR environment has been utilised to perform scaling—a 3D object manipulation method—to create simplified building models. Moreover, navigation in the VR space using tilting of the head has been employed with the user seated on a revolving chair, thus eliminating the need for any limbic movement. Unity game engine was used to develop two variations of the VR model with a different button layout for creating simple cuboidal volumes mimicking buildings in the virtual environment. Both variations have been tested with 32 individuals against a specific performance indicator (i.e., task completion time) and self-reported metrics, such as the perception of effort applied and degree of visual clutter, followed by retrospective participant feedback sessions. One of the VR application's variants (i.e., variant 1) produced promising results regarding overall usability and effort demand. This paper also proposes a methodological framework for an AI-based, intelligent, and adaptive VR application interface that caters to the user's abilities and pain points in real-time. In the future, this framework could be instrumental in creating a comprehensive gaze-based VR tool for 3D modelling having multiple functions to help users with motor disabilities.}

This resulted in the evaluation of 67 relevant journal articles collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The review revealed that ImTs have been applied for OSH training and education in various industries including transportation, construction, mining, and healthcare. It was also revealed that the OSH hazards addressed by ImT-based training and education include but are not limited to fire, fall, electrical and chemical hazards in order to prevent or reduce injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition, it was revealed that one of the benefits of ImTs for OSH training and education is better retention of concepts when compared to conventional training and education. Challenges associated with the use of ImTs for OSH training and education include insufficient display brightness for users to effectively see virtual objects in a brightly luminated environment. Among the recommendations for future work is research into how to develop effective communication methods between trainers and trainees immersed in a virtual environment for trainers to fully understand the difficulties trainees experience in operating the developed ImT-based platform and provide solutions to such difficulties.}

Given limited caches at the sensor nodes, the goal is to develop a distributed cache management algorithm to efficiently answer queries with a known probability distribution over the spatial dimension. First, we propose a novel distributed information theoretic approach assuming knowledge of the distribution of the monitored phenomenon. Under this scheme, nodes minimize an entropic utility function that captures the average amount of uncertainty in queries given the probability distribution of query locations. Second, we propose a correlation-based technique, which only requires knowledge of the second-order statistics, relaxing the stringent constraint of a priori knowledge of the query distribution, while significantly reducing the computational overhead. We show that the proposed approaches considerably improve the average field estimation error. Further, we show that the correlation-based technique is robust to model mismatch in case of imperfect knowledge of the underlying generative correlation structure.}

With the recent technological advancements, virtual reality (VR) experiments could serve as an effective method to prepare civilians and law enforcement personnel for such scenarios. However, for VR experiments to be effective for active shooter training and research, such experiments must be able to evoke emotional and physiological responses as live active shooter drills and events do. The objective of this study is thus to test the effectiveness of an active shooter VR experiment on emotional and physiological responses. Additionally, we consider different locomotion techniques (i.e., walk-in-place and controller) and explore their impact on users’ sense of presence. The results suggest that the VR active shooter experiment in this study can induce emotional arousal and increase heart rate of the participants immersed in the virtual environment. Furthermore, compared to the controller, the walk-in-place technique resulted in a higher emotional arousal in terms of negative emotions and a stronger sense of presence. The study presents a foundation for future active shooter experiments as it supports the ecological validity using VR for active shooter incident related work for the purposes of training or research.}

In combination with efficient and user friendly full body 3-Dimensional (3D) documentation methods, VR visualisations present a viable tool for suspect witness identification. The well-known procedure of placing several persons in a room with a one-way-mirror, along with a witness on the other side of the mirror has practical disadvantages. The primary concern implicates the witness(s) and person(s) of interest coming face-to-face prior to the line-up, combined with finding sufficient persons to include within the line-up. Although image identification using printed paper partially resolved this problem, features such as body stature also marks an issue for the recognition and identification process. To test whether VR provides the technical capabilities to perform an identification parade, a total of 15 subjects were 3D documented using the multi-camera device “Photobox”. From this group, one of the documented persons then interrupted a lecture, where consequently, the students were asked afterwards to identify the same person in VR and paper identification sets. It was found that the participating students were able to identify the “suspect” in both datasets. The results imply that VR technology allow users to identify persons. However, as this is a preliminary study the similarity problem was not analysed in this paper and requires further investigation to demonstrate the robustness of this approach.}

abstract = {Although immersive virtual environments have been used for years for training and learning purposes (e.g., flight and surgery simulators), the effects of using VR devices on simulation sessions are yet to be understood. In this work, we explore the effects of different VR devices on virtual environments developed for training, focusing on perception and knowledge gain aspects. We performed two user studies to investigate the influence of these devices on users’ workload, motion sickness, and performance in the domain of work safety training. The first experiment included 61 participants and sought to understand whether and how VR displays providing different fields of view affects the users’ ability to search for risks in an office-like virtual environment (focus on user perception). Subsequently, we conducted a second experiment involving 46 subjects, where we assess whether and how interaction techniques providing different degrees-of-freedom influence users’ ability to learn procedural tasks (focus on knowledge gain). From our results, we learned that users’ knowledge on the simulation’s topic (i.e. work safety) and gaming experience play an important role in VR simulations, and that cybersickness symptoms such as disorientation are likely caused by unawareness of one’s surroundings instead of VR content.}

Despite much publicity, virtual reality did not live up to its perceived potential. During the past decade, it has also been applied for medical uses, particularly as training simulators, for minimally invasive surgery. Because of advances in computer technology, virtual reality is on the cusp of becoming an effective medical educational tool. At the University of Washington, we are developing a virtual reality soft tissue surgery simulator. Based on fast finite element modeling and using a personal computer, this device can simulate three-dimensional human skin deformations with real-time tactile feedback. Although there are many cutaneous biomechanical challenges to solve, it will eventually provide more realistic dermatologic surgery training for medical students and residents than the currently used models.

abstract = {Objectives
The main objective of the study is to determine the efficiency in the execution of the START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) triage, comparing Virtual Reality (VR) to Clinical Simulation (CS) in a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI). The secondary objective is to determine the stress produced in the health professionals in the two situations described.
Materials
A comparative study on the efficiency and the stress during triage in a MSI was conducted. The basal and post levels of salivary α-amylase (sAA) activity were measured in all the participants before and after the simulation.
Results
The percentage of victims that were triaged correctly was 87.65% (SD = 8.3); 88.3% (SD = 9.65) for the Clinical Simulation with Actors (CSA) group and 87.2% (SD = 7.2) for the Virtual Reality Simulation (VRG) group, without any significant differences (p = 0.612) between both groups. The basal sAA was 103.26 (SD = 79.13) U/L with a significant increase (p < 0.001) with respect to the post-simulation levels (182.22, SD = 148.65 U/L). The increase of sAA was 80.70 (SD = 109.67) U/mL, being greater for the CSA group than the VRG group.
Conclusion
The results show that virtual reality method is as efficient as clinical simulation for training on the execution of basic triage (START model). Also, based on the sAA results, we can attest that clinical simulation creates a more stressful training experience for the student, so that is should not be substituted by the use of virtual reality, although the latter could be used as a complementary activity.}

abstract = {It is difficult to observe the potential risks of lifting or turn-over operations in the early stages before a real operation. Therefore, many dynamic simulations have been designed to predict the risks and to reduce the possibility of accidents. These simulations, however, have usually been performed for predetermined and fixed scenarios, so they do not reflect the real-time control of an operator that is one of the most important influential factors in an operation; additionally, lifting or turn-over operations should be a collaboration involving more than two operators. Therefore, this study presents an integrated method for a collaborative simulation that allows multiple workers to operate together in the virtual world. The proposed method is composed of four components. The first component is a dynamic analysis that is based on multibody-system dynamics. The second component is VR (virtual reality) for the generation of realistic views for the operators. The third component comprises the control devices and the scenario generator to handle the crane in the virtual environment. Lastly, the fourth component is the HLA (high-level architecture)-based integrated simulation interface for the convenient and efficient exchange of the data through the middleware. To show the applicability of the proposed method, it has been applied to a block turn-over simulation for which one floating crane and two crawler cranes were used, and an offshore module installation for which a DCR (dual-crane rig) was used. In conclusion, the execution of the proposed method of this study is successful regarding the above two applications for which multiple workers were involved.}

However, this significant technology has not achieved the expected breakthrough in the industrial engineering area yet. The potential of the VR to digitize and to improve the engineering process of industrial companies especially for SMEs is still undiscovered. This has led to a poor implementation and use of the VR applications with an engineering scope compared with other business sectors e.g. gaming, entertainments. This paper presents and discusses two case studies achieved within cooperation project between the University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe and German manufacturers for fire trucks and systems for firefighting and disaster protection. The aim of the case studies is the implementation of VR applications and their evaluation in terms of using in the business processes of the involved industrial partner. Based on the experiences gathered during this cooperation project a CAD Data transformation process for an industrial VR application as best-practice approach will be outlined and discussed in this paper. © 2020 The Authors.

Educational environments are one of the most common locations of such events. To reduce the impact of these disasters, several emergency plans have been developed and put in place. Traditionally, these emergency plans are taught to occupants using non-interactive videos, drills, etc. However, these conventional methods present many limitations regarding trainees' knowledge acquisition, engagement and self-efficacy. To overcome them, this paper presents the prototype of an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) Serious Game (SG) for counterterrorism training. A user-centred evaluation of the proposed training SG was conducted with 32 participants. The experiment aimed to investigate the impact of the proposed tool on participants' knowledge regarding the safest actions to take in case of an active shooter attack. Participants' intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy levels were also assessed before and after the VR-based training. Findings indicate that participants’ knowledge, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy significantly increased immediately after the training.}

The primary environmental characteristics were layout orthogonality (using paths that intersected at either oblique or 90° angles), lines of sight (controlled using computer-generated “fog”), a visually defined perimeter and global landmarks. Participants travelled less far in orthogonal than oblique environments, even when fog was used to make the distance that participants could see equivalent. The removal of fog caused a further, substantial reduction in the distance participants travelled, indicating the importance of extended lines of sight, as predicted by the architectural theory of space syntax. Global landmarks promoted a similar rate of spatial learning to a visual perimeter.}

For this reason, the study involved the maintenance task of replacing the air filter of a gas-powered engine through a series of instructions. The virtual reality-based accident causation model (VR-ACM) consisting of 3D modeling and simulation, accident causation, and safety training was adapted to address the study's aims. Two groups of participants were immersed in the virtual realm as occupants of the powerhouse to determine the pre-movement time and the evacuation duration under distinct scenarios. The first scenario constituted the experimental group (n = 26), who were assigned to replace the filters, while the second scenario (control n = 26) performed no task before the fire outbreak. An independent samples t-test revealed a significant difference in the pre-movement time of the groups, which suggested a decline in the perception of the experimental group due to the task. Further assessment revealed a consequential transfer of the delay at the pre-movement phase to the evacuation delay of the experimental group from the powerhouse. Secondly, the differences in interactivity implied that the experimental group exhibited a higher level of involvement and distraction in the Presence measurement than the control group. To this end, a virtual reality (VR) environment's performance and real-time functionality during a maintenance task simulation have been experimented with in an emergency fire evacuation scenario to ascertain safety concerns.}

Many of these situations can be safely simulated for training purposes in the real world. Radiological threats, however, are difficult to simulate due to the lack of materials that can mimic radiation sources without the danger of the real radiation. To address the need for a system to train CSTs to respond to radiological threats, we have developed the Radiological Immersive Survey Training (RIST) system. RIST simulates radiological threats from multiple sources using a realistic real-time shielding model based on ray casting and allows users to practice surveying the threat using simulated representations of the world and equipment. We have developed an after action review tool to allow a trainer to show trainees a recording of their survey and how they can improve. We also created a scenario design tool to allow the trainer to create complex environments with radiological threats. We developed novel multi-user interaction techniques to enable simultaneous training for two CST members in an immersive virtual environment. We also introduced a novel multi-perspective rendering technique for two users based on each user's task rather than field of view. Finally, we conducted a preliminary user study with several pairs of expert users to measure user preferences and the effects of using this technique, in conjunction with how altering which user navigated, on user performance. CST survey teams from two states have now used the system for training.}

However, whether and how different cultural backgrounds affect firefighters' acquisition and utilization of spatial knowledge during wayfinding tasks has not been comprehensively explored. To narrow this knowledge gap, we conducted a virtual reality-based search and rescue experiment with a 4 (spatial information type: control, landmark, route, and survey condition) × 2 (culture: the US and China) mixed factorial design. For each trial, firefighters were required to find three trapped victims in a virtual office maze within 3 min after a 3-min review of a certain type of spatial information. The wayfinding performance metrics (number of victims found, rescue score, distance to the goal path), direction decision-making strategy, and cognitive load of 62 firefighter participants were measured and analyzed. The results indicated that spatial information type, culture, and the interaction influence between them all significantly affected the firefighters' wayfinding performance. We found that the route and survey information contributed to firefighters' wayfinding performance with different degrees of influence on the US and Chinese firefighters; whereas the landmark information increased firefighters’ cognitive load and impaired their wayfinding performance. We also found that the acquisition and utilization process of spatial information for navigation varied among different cultures. The findings of this study are expected to help develop better training strategies for firefighters, as well as improve their safety and efficiency during search and rescue operations.}

However, the excessive information provided by these new methods results in cognitive overload, leading to subpar performance. Especially for emergency wayfinding where responders need to process a large amount of information while performing search and hazard identification tasks, an overdesigned wayfinding user interface and excessive information can cause confusion or disorientation among responders. This study proposes and tests a real-time cognition-driven navigation assistive system for emergency wayfinding called CogDNA. CogDNA measures responders’ real-time cognitive load and mental status based on the high-frequent pupillometer and gazes tracking data. Then the elements and formats of the primary wayfinding information are adjusted based on the individualized cognitive load models and the mental fatigue status measured by the pupillometer data including gaze movement entropy and blink rate. To test the efficacy of CogDNA, a human-subject experiment (n = 31) was performed with local firefighters in a simulated emergency wayfinding task. Three conditions were presented including the control condition with a static wayfinding system, a self-adaption condition where responders could adjust information with gesture controls, and the auto-adaption condition that tailored information based on real-time cognitive load and mental status measures. The result shows that the proposed method reduces the workload and improves the performance of the responders during the wayfinding task. The self-reported assessments also indicate benefits of the proposed method in cognitive load. The findings prove the efficacy of adaptive wayfinding information systems based on real-time cognitive load measures for future emergency wayfinding tasks.}

abstract = {Objective
To test six different methods of directing a user's attention in a peripheral head mounted display assisted visual search task.
Background
Each time a user needs to shift their attention between virtual information and their environment has a cost. The faster a user can process a guiding cue and the fewer times they need to return to it, the more efficient that cue will be at directing a user's attention. The most effective method, creating a visual effect at the location of the target, is not suitable for peripheral head mounted displays. This study tests alternative guiding cues better suited to these devices.
Method
Participants searched for a singleton target hidden among 299 distractors while directed with one of six device-delivered guiding cues. Search times were recorded.
Results
A static region map was the most efficient and most preferred cue. Static and dynamic directional cues were also effective in comparison to non-guided search. Cues designed to work solely within the participants’ peripheral vision were relatively ineffective
Conclusion
Guidance cues that direct a user's attention to targets within the real environment do not need to precisely lead to the target. It is instead more efficient to lead a user to the general vicinity of the target quickly and then have the user revert to their natural visual search behaviour.
Application
This finding is broadly useful when assisting visual search tasks with handheld or worn devices which do not cover the user's full field of view.
Précis
This study tested six different methods of guiding attention in a peripheral head-mounted display assisted visual search task. This study compared static, dynamic and peripheral-vision endogenous cues to targets and found a static simple map cue both fastest and most preferred by users.}

However, social psychology literature highlights several factors that can bias individual response to an emergency in the real world, and would be worth considering in virtual training systems. In this paper, we focus on withdrawal of help due to racial discrimination and explore the potential of virtual environments to trigger this bias in emergency situations. We also test if a virtual emergency is actually reacted to as an emergency. We use an immersive virtual environment (IVE) where a victim issues help requests during two different emergency situations (time pressure or fire). While experiencing the emergency, white participants (N=96) receive a request for help from a black or white virtual human. The results show a psychological response to the virtual experience consistent with an emergency situation (increased state anxiety and increased frequency of collisions with objects in the environment) and biased by racial discrimination in help provision. In addition, racial discrimination increases under time pressure, but not in a fire. The implications for virtual training are discussed.}

The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) significantly improves the accessibility and effectiveness of the healthcare system by forming the eHealth environment, thus, providing an opportunity to enhance the quality of patient care and significantly speed up the work of medical experts and reduce costs for medical services. Shifting medical services to digital and remote operations requires a lot of computational capabilities. Implementing new computing paradigms is prominent — remote services face new requirements due to the increasing data and demand for new computing solutions. Computing paradigms, e.g., Cloud, Edge, Mobile Edge Computing, besides others, are used to process the collected medical data, improving patient healthcare quality. This paper focuses on computing solutions for medical use cases by offering a comprehensive survey on standardization aspects, use cases, applicable computing paradigms, security limitations, and design considerations within the ICT usages for medical applications.

The primary contribution of the presented work is the design and implementation of a dynamic user-viewpoint tracking scheme in which mobile users’ spatial context is defined not only by their position (i.e., location), but also by their three-dimensional head orientation (i.e., line of sight). This allows the identification of objects and artifacts visible in a mobile user’s field of view with much higher accuracy than was possible by tracking position alone. For outdoor applications, a georeferencing based algorithm has been developed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and magnetic orientation tracking devices [5] to track a user’s dynamic viewpoint. For indoor applications, this study explored the applicability of wireless technologies, in particular Indoor GPS, for dynamic user position tracking in situations where GPS is unavailable. The objectives of this paper are to describe the details of the three-stage-algorithm that has been designed and implemented, and to demonstrate the extent to which positioning technologies such as GPS and Indoor GPS can be used together with high-precision orientation trackers to accurately interpret the fully-qualified spatial context of a mobile user in challenging environments such as those found on construction sites. The obtained results highlight the potential of using location-aware technologies for rapidly identifying and retrieving contextual information in engineering applications.}

The headset, developed by Meta Platforms Inc., immerses the user in a completely simulated environment. Some VR environments can be shared over the Internet to allow users to communicate and interact with one another and share their experiences. Unfortunately, the safety of these VR environments cannot always be guaranteed, generating a risk that users may be exposed to illicit online behaviour in the form of online harassment, grooming, and cyberbullying. Therefore, forensic examiners must be able to conduct sound forensic analysis of VR headsets to investigate these criminal investigations. In this study, we conduct digital forensic acquisition and analysis of the Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Analysis of the forensic image exemplified that there were several digital artefacts relating to user activities, device information and stored digital artefacts that can be extracted in a forensically sound manner. The main contributions of this study include a detailed description of the forensic acquisition process, identification of internal file storage locations, and recovery and analysis of digital artefacts that can be used to aid VR forensic investigations.}

At present, research on VR mine safety training is limited; it focuses mainly on the implementation of a VR training system rather than the evaluation of the techniques and methods employed, which is far more important. The evaluation of a VR safety training system mainly includes the selection of indicators, calculation of weights, and a comprehensive evaluation of the system components. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the VR mine safety training system with the analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy logic technology. Firstly, by analyzing the components of the VR system, the weights of the system components and the main elements of each part are determined; the most important part is the software, which has a weight of 49.62%. Secondly, the fuzzy logic of each element will give a comprehensive evaluation result of the system. An existing VR training system is evaluated, and the result appears to be moderate. The main disadvantage of the system is the lack of realism, the absence of user data record, and the limited degree of freedom of the VR scene. Through this method, the VR training system can be scientifically and efficiently evaluated, and the system shortcomings can be derived from the evaluation results, so that the system can be improved in future, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the system itself, and laying a solid foundation for safety training.}

Methods To improve experience of multi-user co-located collaboration, in this study, we propose a fire drill system supporting co-located collaboration, in which three co-located users can collaborate to complete the virtual firefighting mission. Firstly, with multi-view stereoscopic projective display technology and ultra wideband (UWB) technology, co-located users can roam independently and watch virtual scenes through the correct perspective view based on their own position by wearing dedicated shutter glasses, thus carrying out different virtual tasks, which improves the flexibility of co-located collaboration. Secondly, we design simulated firefighting water-gun using the micro-electromechanical system sensor, through which users can interact with virtual environment, and thus provide a better interactive experience. Finally, we develop a workbench including a holographic display module and multi-touch operation module for virtual scene assembly and virtual environment control. Results The controller can use the workbench to adjust the virtual layout in real time, and control the virtual task process to increase the flexibility and playability of system. Conclusions Our work can be employed in a wide range of related virtual reality applications.}

Virtual reality could be a way to expose participants to a residential fire scenario and collect data on their behavior. However, the validity of the data obtained needs to be assessed. To explore that, the data collected in two virtual reality residential fire scenarios in form of sequences of behavior was compared to the general model developed by Canter, Breaux and Sime. Two scenarios were developed, one with and one without a smoke alarm. Two samples of 20 participants each were exposed to a fire in a virtual house. The participants were residents of houses with the same layout as the virtual one, making them familiar with the building. The sequence of actions they performed were recorded and decomposition diagrams were drafted based on them, to then be compared to the general model. The results show that the participants’ sequences of behavior did not only fit those predicted by the general model, but also that the participants followed many different sequences, covering most of the possible patterns indicated in the general model, as it is expected in a real world fire.}

Applying genetic susceptibility information to improve health will likely require educating patients about abstract concepts, for which there is little existing research. This experimental study examined the effect of learning mode on comprehension of a genomic concept.
Methods
156 individuals aged 18–40 without specialized knowledge were randomly assigned to either a virtual reality active learning or didactic learning condition. The outcome was comprehension (recall, transfer, mental models).
Results
Change in recall was greater for didactic learning than for active learning (p<0.001). Mean transfer and change in mental models were also higher for didactic learning (p<0.0001 and p<0.05, respectively). Believability was higher for didactic learning (p<0.05), while ratings for motivation (p<0.05), interest (p<0.0001), and enjoyment (p<0.0001) were higher for active learning, but these variables did not mediate the association between learning mode and comprehension.
Conclusion
These results show that learning mode affects comprehension, but additional research is needed regarding how and in what contexts different approaches are best for educating patients about abstract concepts.
Practice implications
Didactic, interpersonal health education approaches may be more effective than interactive games in educating patients about abstract, unfamiliar concepts. These findings indicate the importance of traditional health education approaches in emerging areas like genomics.}

At the first stage, some randomly selected image patches are used as negative samples for the training of SDA classifier, and nose is detected from the whole face image. The second stage refines nose tip position by using some nose context patches as negative samples for the training of SDA classifier. The proposed method detects nose from the whole face image and no a priori knowledge about the layout of face components is used. Experimental results on AR images show that the proposed method can achieve high nose tip localization rates, and is robust to changes of illumination and facial expression.}

Based on the classifications of the input/output devices that are used in the VR system, the current VR training systems for the mining industry could be divided into three types: screen-based general type, projector-based customized type, and head-mounted display (HMD)-based intuitive type. By employing a VR headset, a smartphone and a leap motion device, an HMD-based intuitive type VR training system prototype for drilling in underground mines has been developed. Ten trainees tried both the HMD-based intuitive system and the screen-based general control system to compare the experiences and training effects. The results show that the HMD-based system can give a much better user experience and is easy to use. Three of the five components of a VR training system, namely, the user, the tasks, and software and database should be given more attention in future research.

Each of the seven 3-D crack cocaine scenes in the cocaine environment depicted actors engaging in a range of using-related behaviors (i.e., smoking crack) whereas the neutral environment contained scenes depicted 3-D aquariums with active aquatic life (baseline measures were obtained following immersion in the neutral environment). Results indicated that craving was significantly elevated during the cocaine-related scenes as compared to baseline. Craving varied by scene content, with scenes depicting active cocaine use eliciting the highest levels of craving. Heart rate was significantly higher in four of the scenes with drug use content and positive affect (i.e., happiness) ratings were significantly lower during cocaine scenes as compared to baseline. Overall, the results suggest that a standardized and stimulus rich virtual reality environment effectively elicits craving and physiologic reactivity. Such technology has potential utility in the development and refinement of exposure-based behavioral and pharmacological interventions for substance use disorders.}

Nowadays, technologies including Virtual Reality (VR) and Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) are shifting from the physical to the virtual paradigm. AR enables just to extend real-world environment, while VR and IVR allow to (re)create and manipulate digital environments. VR and IVR simulation systems have been observed to guarantee higher involvement and long-term information retention — leveraging more attractive experiences and psychological arousal. However, efforts should be provided to improve end-user training while assessing occupants’ behaviors and the effectiveness of the emergency plan. This paper proposes a systematic literature review of VR and IVR evacuation solutions. To support and guide such effort, we formulated thirteen structured research questions investigating scenarios, recipients, requirements, objectives, methods, and technologies. The results mainly show that VR and IVR drills almost entirely tackle a single hazard, considers occupants as sole system recipients, and lack systems formalization. Among the most relevant outcomes, the paper analyzes the need for enhancing the modeling of emergency systems (e.g., signage, alarms), user inclusiveness (i.e., impaired individuals), devices, non-player characters, and additional effects (e.g., heat reproduction, sounds, and smells). These measures can improve the level of realism experienced by the user of IVR simulators and pave the way to more reliable outcomes.}

The Hospital and Biogarden games’ scenarios were based on the joint activities held in 2018 in France and Belgium as part of the EU H2020 European Network Of CBRN Training CEnters (eNOTICE) project, while the mining game was created over a replica of a training mine at a university in Turkey. Sixteen CBRN-e experts from the eNOTICE project, who took part in the physical training programs in France and Belgium, evaluated the games. For evaluation and extensive feedback, presence, system usability scale, technology acceptance model questionnaires, and open-ended questions were conducted. The findings revealed that serious games have a vast potential in CBRN-e training, and the comparisons of different environments provided invaluable testbeds giving hindsight to develop a future training program.}

Within the medical profession, simulation techniques have been used extensively by anesthesiologists for individual and teamwork training tasks. Following the example in anesthesiology, simulation curricula are being developed for teaching and evaluating core competencies for surgical and emergency medicine residents, prehospital personnel, and medical students. Simulation models can be as simple as static mannequins for procedural skills or as complex as high-fidelity human patient simulators that react physiologically to administered medications and provider actions. As this technology continues to mature, benefits of incorporating such safe and valuable education to trainees across all medical disciplines and training levels must be considered in light of the expense of such endeavors. Benefits of simulation training within the medical field include learning and perfecting procedural skills before patient interaction, participating in rare or complicated case scenarios which might otherwise not be encountered in traditional training, and nonprocedural training such as teamwork training and disaster management skills. As efforts continue to emerge to increase patient safety and reduce medical errors, simulation has become more popular in promoting patient autonomy while allowing trainees to experience positive and negative outcomes with the opportunity for constructive feedback, or debriefing, afterward.}

Each situation requires different levels of care and the diagnosis and treatments administered play a large role in the recovery of the trauma victims. In such events it is vital to provide the correct level of care with high efficiency and with minimal errors. However these fast paced situations lead to stressful environments contributing to errors in patient care leading to detrimental consequences of morbidity. Computerized decision support systems have been introduced into the medical industry which have greatly improved patient recovery in trauma care, however such systems are primarily targeted for use in well-established medical facilities. The time it takes to transport an injured victim at the scene to a medical facility also plays an important role in the recovery process; by introducing optical head mounted display systems, remote off site field support can be provided which can enhance effective medical advice offered to both inexperienced through to properly trained medical staff prior, during transport and upon reception at a medical facility. This device is expected to greatly improve the recovery phase of trauma victims and reduce errors in patient treatment and diagnosis both in and out of hospital care.}

Participants completed the crime scene report using either the conventional paper form, an electronic form on a tablet computer (to represent the current trend in digitisation of crime scene reports), or a wearable computer (with speech input). While both computer conditions (tablet and wearable) led to faster performance, when compared with the paper condition, there was no difference in content or quality of the reports produced in any of the three conditions; thus, the computer conditions produced acceptable reports in much faster time when compared to conventional practice. Furthermore, activity sampling analysis showed that participants found it much easier to integrate the wearable computer (than either paper forms or tablet computer) into their search and recovery activity.}

These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0. The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training.}

For this it is important that people are properly trained. Faced with the economic, ecological and organizational requirements and constraints linked to fire safety training, virtual training environments appear to be a judicious alternative to traditional training. However, before committing companies to invest in expensive devices, it is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such devices. The literature is rich and divided on this subject, and it appears that certain characteristics of the system and of the learners are decisive. In this context, the objective of our work was to study the effects of immersion, the feeling of presence as well as the interaction between these 2 factors on the performance of conceptual and procedural learning. Certain variables were also controlled such as gender, tendency to immersion, previous experience in computers and video games. Our work shows that immersion promotes procedural but not conceptual learning, and that neither the sense of presence, nor the interaction between immersion and the sense of presence affect these two types of learning in our training task. Apart from the knowledge of fire which potentiates the effect of immersion on procedural learning, the variables considered in our study (computer experience, video game experience and genre) had no impact on performance. Understanding the impact of the technical device or the characteristics of users on conceptual and procedural learning is a major challenge in helping trainers to develop pedagogical devices in order to better exploit the opportunities offered by new technological approaches.}

These technologies could discover and warn users about unanticipated events such as just-in-time warnings about the hazards, distractions, extreme weather calamities, and potential impending dangers. An automated personalized agent helps monitor, diagnose problems, and protect people in an urban environment. Researchers have proposed various systems and implemented them in multiple domains.

This phenomenal growth in useable technology and its proportionate decrease in price have benefited the applicability of VR which in turn, have made it more accessible for researchers wishing to harness its benefits. The last 10 years have seen a steady increase in the use of VR technology to restore, preserve, reconstruct, recreate, and visualise ancient sites, monuments and artefacts. But, is technology ready for virtual time travel (VTT)? This article examines the possibility of experiential archaeology in voltage and silicon with the aim of formulating a strategy for VTT.}

abstract = {Chemical images which are often computed from hyperspectral images contain the spatial distribution of chemical information of a scene. For many applications visualizing such images on computer screens is sufficient, however there are cases where there is a need to combine the chemical images more naturally with human vision. This is especially true for interactive work where chemical images are being rapidly updated to the user. Effective integration of spatial information in general from external sources with vision is a challenge. One approach is to overlay the view of the real physical world with computer-generated graphics as in augmented reality. However such cluttering of the visual field with computer-generated graphics may confuse the user and reduce functionality. Another is projecting the chemical images back onto the scene under study in order to render the chemical information in situ to the user. This approach, however has challenges in connection with very small and very large scenes under investigation. An alternative approach is here investigated based on the possibility of enhancing the human vision system using a sensory substitution device. Such devices enables a person to sense spatial information conveyed through sensory channels other than the eye, such as hearing and sense of touch. Results presented support the claim that spatial chemical information from a hyperspectral camera can be conveyed to the brain through a sensory channel different from the eyes. As this is tested on a sighted subject it effectively provides an extension of the human vision system to incorporate chemical information which otherwise is invisible to the naked eye.}

However, insufficient artificial intelligence performance in unknown and unpredictable environments, and non-intuitive control interfaces with low immersive feedback have prevented wide spread of such robotic systems. In this paper, an intuitive and interactive control interface with inertial measurement units (IMUs), haptic gloves and a head mounted display (HMD) was developed to control a tele-operated robot in remote environments, which was abbreviated as AVATAR system. The tele-operated robot can be operated by a user’s motions which are measured by the wearable interface. Through a kinematic analysis of the user and the tele-operated robot, desired robot joint angles are calculated to follow the user’s motions in real time. Also, dual cameras on the robot head provide 3D visual information around the robot to the user. A grasping force of the robot hands, measured by motor current, is transmitted to the user as vibration feedback to fingertips of the haptic gloves. A long term evolution (LTE) was used as wireless communication between the user and the robot. The performance of the proposed AVATAR system has been verified by experiments.}

Furthermore, there is potential for greater adoption of digital twin, especially in simulating urban flood inundation and flood evacuation routes. Integrating real-time data, data-driven modeling, and CDVT can significantly improve real-time flood forecasting. This benefits stakeholders and the public by enhancing early warning systems, preparedness, and flood resilience, leading to more effective flood risk management and reduced impacts on communities.}

Efforts are underway to develop advanced cartridges for next-generation gas respirators in civil-military combined use to improve wearability and protection for users (firefighters, military personnel, and environmental and safety-related workers). Herein, the performance of three newly designed cartridges for a next-generation gas respirator was evaluated using flow analysis, along with adsorption characteristics. The adsorption kinetics of cyclohexane gas on ASC (a copper-silver-hexavalent chromium impregnated activated carbon in the study) was measured by breakthrough experiments in a packed bed, and the obtained parameters were used in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for the designed plate-type cartridges. To apply the physical properties of the adsorbent to the CFD simulation, porous materials were expressed using the granular technique and packed bed technique. The CFD model was verified through a gas adsorption experiment using a prototype cartridge. The respiration resistance and breakthrough time for the filled-adsorbent efficiency and lifespan were compared among the three designed cartridges according to the gas inflow conditions. Additionally, virtual engineering was performed by grafting the CFD results to a virtual reality (VR) system with which 3-dimensional performance visuals of the cartridges could be observed. The developed VR system provides detailed information for cartridge design and optimization. Overall, the developed procedure of virtual engineering can be used to improve CFD simulation results.}

abstract = {Significance
As technology advances, there is a need for a safe and well-fitting contact lens that can be utilized to carry embedded components without concerns of decreasing oxygen permeability to the eye.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess fitting characteristics, vision and performance of a novel ultra-high Dk silicone elastomer contact lens having a fully encapsulated two-state polarizing filter and a high-powered central lenslet that allows viewing at distance and viewing of a near eye display, while managing the concomitant high water vapor permeability of the material.
Methods
15 participants were fit with the silicone elastomer study lenses. Biomicroscopy was conducted before and after lens wear. Visual acuity with manifest refraction and visual acuity with an over-refraction while wearing the plano-powered study lenses were measured. Participants wore spectacles with micro-displays at the focal length of the lenslet on each eye. Lens fit was assessed including ease of lens removal. Subjective assessments of viewing the micro-displays were completed on a 1(unable) to 10(immediate/profound/stable) scale.
Results
Biomicroscopy revealed no eyes had moderate or severe corneal staining after study lens wear. Mean (±standard deviation) LogMAR acuity for all eyes was −0.13(0.08) with best corrected refraction and −0.03(0.06) with the study lenses and over-refraction. Mean spherical equivalent of the manifest refraction for both eyes was −3.12 D and was −2.75 D over the plano study lenses. Subjective assessments revealed a mean score of 7.67(1.91) for ease of obtaining fusion; 8.47(1.30) for ease of observing three-dimensional vision, and 8.27(1.49) for stability of the fused binocular display vision.
Conclusion
The silicone elastomer study lenses with a two-state polarizing filter and central lenslet allow for vision at distance and on spectacle mounted micro-displays.}

Performing the two tasks together resulted in significant dual-task interference. We also compared these results to previous studies employing the tone counting tasks with physically demanding tasks (climbing, kayaking and running). The interference between tone counting and mathematical calculations was worse than the interference between tone counting and running and kayaking. For climbing, the difference in interference was more nuanced with evidence indicating climbing uniquely asserts task prioritization. These findings have implications for operations requiring dual or multi-tasking.}

Awareness of a user's context (such as user profile, role, preferences, task, and existing project conditions) can enhance the construction project delivery process by providing a mechanism to determine information relevant to a particular context. Context awareness can also be used to improve security, logistics and health and safety practices on construction sites. Location is an important aspect of context awareness. A location aware application can utilize the knowledge of the user/object location to provide relevant information and services. This paper argues that a successful and reliable location tracking system must be able to track a user's spatial context and deliver contextual data continuously in both outdoor and indoor environments to effectively support construction projects. Research describing the use of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) for indoor tracking and Global Positioning System (GPS) for outdoor spatial context tracking is presented, and an integrated tracking technique using WLAN and GPS for ubiquitous location sensing is introduced. The key benefits and technical challenges of such an integrated approach are also highlighted. The presented tracking techniques have been validated in both indoor and outdoor environments to ensure their practical implementation on real construction jobsites.}

The effective memorization and retrieval of critical spatial information can help reduce risks and increase mission efficiency. Although evidence has shown that different formats of wayfinding information, including landmarks, routes, and surveys, can impact search and rescue performance in different manners, a deeper understanding of the characteristics of firefighters’ cognitive processes related to the varying wayfinding information formats is less explored. To evaluate firefighters’ performance and cognitive characteristics in search and rescue, a firefighter experiment in Virtual Reality (VR) was conducted. Firefighters (n = 40) were recruited to participate in the simulated rescue task. After reviewing the spatial information in different formats, firefighters were requested to find three victims inside a VR maze as quickly as possible. Task performance was evaluated by the number of victims found and the time spent. Firefighters’ gaze patterns were analyzed to evaluate their cognitive status. The result showed that although the cognitive load under the survey and route conditions was significantly higher than under the landmark condition (p < 0.001), the decision-making involved a more effective cognitive process related to choosing the right path at critical waypoints such as where a turning decision must be made. Thus, the perceived workload and fatigue levels of the two conditions were lower, and the wayfinding performance was better. In contrast, with landmark information, the cognitive load levels were consistently high, along with increased mental fatigue. The findings reveal a series of cognitive features related to a more effective spatial decision-making in search and rescue. In the future, it is expected that these cognitive features can be used to develop real-time monitoring and prediction models for wayfinding performance.}

Simulation training is essential to improve this situation however, there is no report describing how to conduct an effective simulation in detail for dental office medical emergencies. The purpose of this review is to provide information on simulations that is effective and practical. The authors will highlight the key characteristics for providing effective simulation trainings, such as the selection of simulators, simulation locations, instructors, debriefings, methods for evaluating educational effectiveness, and the use of telesimulation as a method for simulation training due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this review provides recommendations on tailoring an ideal simulation training course for those who wish to create one.

Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an intuitive teleoperation interface, an anthropomorphic teleoperated robot, and a hand-wearable force-feedback system that provides various feedbacks to the fingers. We combined these systems to compare and evaluated the performance of tactile and kinesthetic finger feedback using two experiments: maintaining appropriate grip force for variably fragile objects and following a force trajectory that changed in real time. Ten subjects participated in the experiments. The results were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Feedback factors differed significantly. Provision of force feedback to the user’s finger was most effective in both teleoperation experiments.}

abstract = {With the increasing complexity of modern buildings, it is becoming more challenging for the professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to effectively digest complex engineering and design information and develop an accurate spatial memory that is critical to their daily tasks. As emerging visualization technologies, such as Virtual Reality, are considered as a promising solution, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanism by which different information visualization methods affect AEC task performance. Cognition literature has discovered a strong relationship between attention and memory development, but little has been done to understand how the visual attention patterns during the design documents review affect the effectiveness of spatial memory in AEC tasks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 63) to test how spatial knowledge is acquired in a building inspection task and how the different visual attention patterns affect the development of spatial memory. Participants were asked to review the design information of a real building on campus. To trigger different attention patterns, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups based on the forms of information given in the review session, including 2D, 3D, and VR groups. After a brief review session, participants were asked to go to the real building to identify discrepancies (based on memory) that were intentionally inserted by the authors. The inspection performance was used to evaluate the spatial memory development. The results indicate that in general there is a positive relationship between test subjects’ visual attention (fixation time) and spatial memory, but the increasing rate varies across the three groups, suggesting that visual context plays a critical role in the development efficiency of spatial memory. The findings also indicate that the visual attention – spatial memory relationship may be mediated by the use of different spatial knowledge acquisition strategies. This study is expected to contribute to the construction information technology literature by setting the cornerstone of a cognition-driven information system that tailors into the spatial cognitive process of AEC professionals.}

The ability to create clinical simulations through virtual reality (VR) may facilitate the accomplishment of these goals. The purpose of this paper is 2-fold: (1) to review the circumstances and equipment in industry, science, and education in which VR has been successfully applied, and (2) to explore the possible role of VR for training in obstetrics and gynecology and to suggest innovative and unique approaches to enhancing this training. Material And Methods: Qualitative assessment of the literature describing successful applications of VR in industry, law enforcement, military, and medicine from 1995 to 2000. Articles were identified through a computer-based search using Medline, Current Contents, and cross referencing bibliographies of articles identified through the search. Results: One hundred and fifty-four articles were reviewed. This review of contemporary literature suggests that VR has been successfully used to simulate person-to-person interactions for training in psychiatry and the social sciences in a variety of circumstances by using real-time simulations of personal interactions, and to launch 3-dimensional trainers for surgical simulation. These successful applications and simulations suggest that this technology may be helpful and should be evaluated as an educational modality in obstetrics and gynecology in two areas: (1) counseling in circumstances ranging from routine preoperative informed consent to intervention in more acute circumstances such as domestic violence or rape, and (2) training in basic and advanced surgical skills for both medical students and residents. Conclusion: Virtual reality is an untested, but potentially useful, modality for training in obstetrics and gynecology. On the basis of successful applications in other nonmedical and medical areas, VR may have a role in teaching essential elements of counseling and surgical skill acquisition.

Main issues in WSN are represented by the large number of sensor nodes, multi-hop communication approach, and needs for an efficient use of available limited sensor energy. In this work an emergency scenario is considered and a WSN is used as a communication infrastructure. To limit the power consumption, the WSN is activated only when the emergency occurs. Few mobile nodes (the rescuers) are moving in the area. In these critical network scenarios, adaptive routing is essential to ensure reliable communication with first responders. At the same time, localizing both WSN nodes and moving nodes is an essential issue for routing the rescuers towards victims. In this paper, the authors jointly tackle routing and localization problems for reducing the network signaling communication as much as possible, which is the most power-consuming operation in WSNs. In particular, it is proposed a distributed localization algorithm, based on a ranging technique, designed by mapping the localization into a stochastic estimation problem for systems with uncertainties.}

abstract = {This article develops a theoretical framework for studying the algorithmic underpinnings of contemporary augmented reality technologies. We delineate this framework through the rhetorical figure of the “daimon,” a greek mythological entity as well as a technical concept within computer science, to articulate an approach to AR algorithms as emergent, material processes that can create unpredicted, unintended effects. Ultimately, we argue that the conceptual framework of the “daimon” provides an interface through which writing and rhetoric scholars can better discern the algorithmic effects of emerging AR composing platforms.}

Visual, auditory, and tactile modalities were tested and evaluated using unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal conditions. Questionnaires, interviews and observations were used to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each modality and their multimodal use. The guidance was considered easy to interpret and helpful in navigation. Simplicity of the displayed information was required, which was partially conflicting with the request for having both distance and directional information available.}

In this paper, we design and assess a touch user interface that is built on a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) to allow peers to exchange tactile signals in VR applications. First, we explored the interface capabilities by assessing different gestures to be adopted in the reproduction of tactile signals. Then, we assessed its use in conjunction with a vibrotactile HMD in a collaborative virtual setup where users could communicate only through vibrotactile cues. Results have shown that accuracy in target localization increases as target density decreases, that swipe gestures are performed with more accuracy when supported by anchor-points, and that accuracy of rhythm reproduction decreases with pace. When applied to a collaborative task, the interface presented high usability and allowed subjects to fully use tactile feedback as a means for intercommunication with their partners.}

Firstly, the cumulative values of CO, CO2, and temperature along the evacuation path were monitored using CFD. Secondly, the smoke toxicity was calculated using the N-GAS model, and the total risk value was computed based on the analytic hierarchy process which was defined as “smoke hazard: temperature hazard = 7:3.” Thirdly, a multiple regression model was created based on accident data. Finally, to minimize accidents, the design of the evacuation path was optimized using the established mathematical model and A* algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the risk assessment model. The results show that the effects of VR agents, emergency evacuation signs, and fire extinguishers on the evacuation behavior of people are mutual influence. This study combined time and route in the VR evacuation experiments to overcome the limitations of the existing control and VR experiments in quantifying the evacuation results. This research can be utilized to improve emergency evacuation plans and emergency response decision making.

This paper investigates the use of a haptic vest in navigation tasks. The haptic vest produces a repulsive vibrotactile feedback from nearby static virtual obstacles that augments the user spatial awareness. The tasks require the user to perform complex movements in a 3D cluttered virtual environment, like avoiding obstacles while walking backwards and pulling a virtual object. The experimental setup consists of a room-scale environment. Our approach is the first study where a haptic vest is tracked in real time using a motion capture device so that proximity-based haptic feedback can be conveyed according to the actual movement of the upper body of the user. User study experiments have been conducted with and without haptic feedback in virtual environments involving both normal and limited visibility conditions. A quantitative evaluation was carried out by measuring task completion time and error (collision) rate. Multiple haptic rendering techniques have also been tested. Results show that under limited visibility conditions proximity-based haptic feedback generated by a wearable haptic vest can significantly reduce the number of collisions with obstacles in the virtual environment.}

While the most common applications of laser technology are found in medical and health care, manufacturing, and communication, other domains such as safety, quality assurance, agriculture, construction, entertainment, defense, transportation, and law enforcement also benefit from it. In spite of the rapid dissemination of this technology, its role in support of collaboration and discovery is still in its infancy. Research activities concerning new ways of using lasers as a collaboration supporting technology that may strengthen new areas have been relatively limited. Nevertheless, the translation to this domain of collaboration support has been recognized as vital for activities that demand increasingly more coordinated effort among interacting agents (e.g., humans, machines, particles) and digital, possibly also photonic agents. Recent advances in laser technology in a number of application domains are reviewed in this article, focusing primarily on lasers’ role for supporting different forms of precision interactions and collaboration. In addition, a framework with five collaboration support functions and five collaboration dimensions is defined for this review. The taxonomy framework is useful for enabling better understanding of the existing and emerging opportunities that laser-based technology offers for collaboration support, its advantages and several research gaps.}

abstract = {Summary
Introduction
Police work is one of the most demanding professions with various sources of high occupational stress. Among the most demanding tasks are amok situations, such as school shootings. Hardly anything is known about endocrine and cardiovascular markers in safety professionals during emergency situations in real life and how this relates to stress perception and management. This study will therefore explore police officers’ stress responses to a reality-based school shooting simulation assessing neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and psychological stress markers.
Methods
A convenience sample of 50 police officers (39.5±8.7 yrs, 9 women) participating in a basic or refresher amok training session for the German uniformed and criminal police were recruited. Saliva samples were collected shortly before the simulation task (school shooting), immediately after, 20 and 45min after finishing the task for the assessment of cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA), as markers of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system, respectively. Heart rate (variability) was assessed continuously. Officers rated their actual mood right before and 10min after the simulation. Subjective experience of task stressfulness was assessed minutes after finishing the simulation.
Results
Overall, the simulated school shooting did not result in changes of mood, tiredness, or calmness but higher restlessness was experienced during the basic training, which was also experienced as more controllable. Female officers reported to experience more strain and anxiety. Cortisol showed highest levels at the beginning of the training and steadily decreasing values thereafter. In contrast, sAA increased substantially right after the simulation with officers on the front position showing most pronounced changes. Cardiovascular reactivity was highest in officers acting on the side positions while advancing to find the suspect. Furthermore higher self-efficacy as well as, by trend, controllability and relevance of results correlated with cardiovascular measures.
Discussion
Autonomic but not endocrine stress markers increased to a simulated school shooting, which were further related to the subjective experience of the simulation. Our results provide a more in-depth picture of stress responses in such situations, which will in the long run raise the possibility to refine training programs, design more effective stress-management strategies for these critical incidents, and improve performance but also coping with work-related stress.}

abstract = {Firefighters often need to digest complex spatial information within a short period of time for search and rescue. Previous wayfinding literature has documented evidence about how the general population in normal situations leverage different forms of spatial information, including landmarks, routes and survey (maps), to develop spatial knowledge and guide wayfinding. However, little is known about how the arbitrarily given spatial information affects firefighter wayfinding behavior and performance when the time is limited and there is no privilege for them to develop complete spatial knowledge in an evolving manner. To narrow the knowledge gap, we conducted a wayfinding experiment with firefighters (n = 40) using Virtual Reality (VR). In the experiment, firefighters were required to find three victims in a simulated office maze. Each firefighter randomly experienced four experimental conditions in this study including control condition, landmark condition, route condition, and survey (map) condition. For each experimental condition, firefighters had 3 min to memorize the different layouts of the virtual office mazes using one of three spatial information including landmarks, routes, and survey (map), and then went to the virtual office maze to find the victims. The number of victims found, time, and navigation patterns were used to evaluate firefighters’ wayfinding performance. The results indicated that the route and survey spatial information was more efficient in facilitating firefighter to memorize the layout, leading to a better wayfinding performance.We also found that although the survey information provided more complete information about the layout, it also burdened firefighters in a way that they had to plan the path with limited time. Since survey information may induce different path planning strategies, survey information did not result in a better performance than the route information as suggestedby previous studies. This research helps explain the relationship between different forms of spatial information and the wayfinding performance of firefighters. The findings will help professionals design better training protocols and technologies for firefighters.}

In order to effectively achieve this training goal, it is crucial to reliably express fire dynamics as realistic graphics. In the field of engineering, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used to precisely predict the behaviors of fluid phenomena. The resultant data, however, have structures and capacities that are not readily applied to real-time virtual reality systems. This study proposes a series of data conversion techniques and a real-time processing framework to develop a fire training simulator on the basis of a precise CFD simulation that is capable of calculating various invisible physical quantities such as toxic gases and heat as well as visible factors such as smoke and flame. By exploiting safety level-based visualization mapping, this study also proposes a new method to intuitively experience dangerous fire environments and perform training and evaluation. Lastly, this study implements a simulator that can undertake simple firefighting activities such as evacuation and rescue in fire situations at road tunnels; the functions and real-time performance of the simulator have been experimentally measured to verify the applicability of the proposed framework.}

abstract = {Even the most junior Warfighters must effectively interact and negotiate with locals from communities that do not share their religious beliefs, social perspectives or customs. These cultural differences introduce a layer of uncertainty into chaotic operational contexts that are marked by moments of intense stress, and often contribute to strong emotional responses such as anxiety or anger. Unchecked, these emotional responses can escalate and lead Warfighters to make judgments and decisions they might not otherwise make. In high stakes situations, even the slightest mistake may have tragic consequences; thus, a need exists to equip Warfighters with skills that allow them to recognize/regulate their emotions. Emotional Intelligence (EI) “is the ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions” [1]. Learning effective strategies to manage our emotions is critical for laying a strong foundation for the development of positive relationships [2], [3]. Being able to effectively build positive relationships in diverse settings is a key attribute of cross cultural competence that may be improved through EI training. By practicing emotion recognition/regulation strategies, individuals will begin to replace ineffective decision-making with productive responses to challenging situations. In order to understand how emotions can influence decision making and social judgment, various moderating factors need to be considered, including cultural, group, and individual differences in emotional recognition/regulation [4]. We provide a brief overview of the operational need, define the basic tenets of EI, and describe how this approach could be implemented within an existing military training setting. We describe how emotion recognition and regulation skills would be exercised and evaluated and list potential benefits of using immersive training for skill development. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future research and development in this area.}

It is argued that key to understanding what serious games encapsulate is to look beyond these characteristics. This article proposes a definition and way to frame serious games technologies, applications and environments along a continuum of gaming characteristics or gameness. From those with traditional gaming activities and characteristics (challenge, play, fun, etc.) at one end to those with minimal traditional gaming characteristics at the other end, whose main purpose is to provide experience and emotion to convey meaning. The main advantages of the definition and continuum are to establish a shared understanding and arena for current and emerging serious games, frame and connect currently fragmented groups into a cohesive serious games movement and community and open opportunities for future collaborative research and development. In addition, it helps in identifying characteristics for the design and assessment of serious games.}

Significantly different from warehouse-scale computers that serve independent concurrent user requests, this new class of computer systems directly interacts with the physical world, considering humans an essential part and performing safety-critical and mission-critical operations; their computations have intertwined dependencies between not only adjacent execution loops but also actions or decisions triggered by IoTs, edge, datacenters, or humans-in-the-loop; the systems must first satisfy the accuracy metric in predicting, interpreting, or taking action before meeting the performance goal under different cases.

We coin a new term, high fusion computers (HFCs), to describe this class of systems. The fusion in the term has two implications: fusing IoTs, edges, data centers, and humans-in-the-loop as a computer, fusing the physical and digital worlds through HFC systems.

abstract = {This work is a systematic review of optimisation methods for pedestrian evacuations. The focus is on interventional approaches that seek to improve evacuation efficiency rather than efforts to purely describe/predict evacuations. Three major evacuation optimisation approaches are identified: (a) architectural design and infrastructure adjustment, (b) mathematical programming and optimisation of path/departure-schedule planning, (c) behavioural modification, training and active instructions. The reviewed literature is dominated by architectural solutions, while the evidence on their effectiveness is largely mixed and inconclusive. They also pose practical challenges: major design interventions in previously-built infrastructure may not always be readily feasible. Furthermore, the effectiveness of architectural solutions is often suggested to be geometry/context dependant rather than universal. Complex path/schedule optimisation solutions also pose their own implementation and enforcement challenges. They often require that an entire crowd be controlled and directed by a central body. They also do not address microscopic aspects of individual behaviour. The behavioural modification method used to be the least studied approach until recently, but it is gaining increasing traction as a promising method in terms of both effectiveness and practicality. Its underexplored potential constitutes a major knowledge gap in evacuation dynamics literature. The first important step to address this gap is to (i) identify possible and most effective areas of behavioural intervention; and (ii) employ reliable experimental or numerical methods to discover optimum strategies, and (iii) determine how behavioural interventions can be effectively conveyed to people. Establishing the relative effectiveness of the three optimisation approaches also constitutes another important question to be explored.}

Using immersive virtual environments, we asked the participants to actively or passively explore a virtual museum to look for hidden treasure keys and then a treasure point. Half of the participants were asked to exit from a virtual museum during a virtual fire emergency after they had actively or passively explored the museum, whereas the other half of the participants were asked to complete the same task under the control condition without the virtual fire. Importantly, both the active and passive exploration conditions allowed the participants to control their own movement, whereas only those under the active exploration condition had the opportunity to make route decisions. Compared to those who explored the virtual museum passively, the participants did it actively traveled longer in completing the egress task. The results also revealed that participants under the fire emergency condition spent more time in finding their way to exit the museum than those under the control condition, and rated the evacuation task to be more difficult. The underlying mechanisms of these findings were discussed.}

Participants were asked to evacuate in the case of a virtual building fire. The results suggested that participants' route choices during evacuations were affected by their neighbors' behaviors. In particular, if a risky route was less preferred due to dense smoke, the effect of neighbor behavior was strongest when enticing participants to take the risky route. Nonetheless, the number of virtual neighbors did not significantly change the degree of social influence on participants' route choices. Moreover, an increase in smoke density significantly reduced the number of participants making risky decisions. The results also indicated that individuals had a tendency to follow others when making risky decisions, but they were not blindly following others. Individuals made their evacuation route decisions by engaging in comprehensive consideration of various types of environmental information.}

In this paper, we describe a novel application of an existing Lagrangian dispersion modeling system to achieve real-time simulation and visualization of an urban plume that a user can interact with in a virtual environment (VE) through the utilization of commodity graphics hardware, utilizing the highly parallel computational capabilities available on graphics processing units (GPU). GPUs have quickly developed from video game technology to open up new avenues for enhancing simulation performance and visualization of engineering and science applications. For computer graphics applications, GPUs provide highly parallel and inexpensive data paths for processing geometry and pixels, but for simulation these parallel paths are exploited for solving general problems. In this paper, a newly developed dispersion model (GPU Plume) is tested against an analytical solution, a CPU implementation of the Lagrangian dispersion model and wind tunnel data for dispersion around a single building. GPU Plume is shown to provide results that are similar in accuracy to the CPU model, but with computation times that are up to two orders magnitude smaller. In addition, challenges associated with the implementation of Lagrangian dispersion models onto the GPU architecture are discussed in this paper.}

The participants (n = 30) were asked to complete wayfinding tasks of varying difficulty in a virtual reality (VR) hospital environment. Time segments when participants experienced navigational uncertainty were first identified using a combination of objective measurements (frequency of inputs into the VR controller) and behavioral annotations from two independent observers. Uncertainty time-segments during navigation were ranked on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high). The machine-learning model, a Random Forest classifier implemented using scikit-learn in Python, was used to evaluate common spatial patterns of EEG spectral power across the theta, alpha, and beta bands associated with the researcher-identified uncertainty states. The overall predictive power of the resulting model was 0.70 in terms of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC-AUC). These findings indicate that EEG data can potentially be used as a metric for identifying navigational uncertainty states, which may provide greater rigor and efficiency in studies of human responses to architectural design variables and wayfinding cues.}

WayR supports free navigation and collects pedestrian walking trajectories, head movements and gaze points automatically. To evaluate WayR, a VR experiment consists of four wayfinding assignments were conducted. The validity and usability of WayR are evaluated using objective measures (i.e., route choice, evacuation exit choice, wayfinding performance, and observation behaviour) and subjective measures (i.e., realism, feeling of presence, system usability, and simulation sickness). Analysis of the objective measures indicates that participants’ wayfinding behaviour in VR matches with findings in the literature. Moreover, we found that overall participants behaved significantly different across wayfinding assignments with increasing complexity. Furthermore, the results of subjective measures indicate a high degree of realism, immersion, usability, and low level of sickness of WayR. Overall, the results demonstrated the face validity, content validity, construct validity and usability of WayR as a research tool to study wayfinding behaviour in a complex multi-story building.}

Free space optical (FSO) communication systems covering an ultra-wide range of unlicensed spectrum have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate conventional RF spectrum scarcity ranging of communication distances from nm to several kilometers. The implication of hybrid FSO, radio over FSO (RoFSO), MIMO FSO systems support ultra high speed 5G/B5G demand by eliminating the limitations of individual technology. FSO offers a broad range of applications both in outdoor and indoor services, for instance, wireless video surveillance, data centers, terrestrial transmission, LAN connectivity, mobile cellular networks, last mile solution, space communications, radio astronomy, remote sensing, and so on. Despite the potential benefits of FSO technology, its link reliability deteriorates due to atmospheric turbulence, cloud induced fading, some other environmental factors such as fog, aerosol, temperature variations, storms, heavy rain, pointing error, and scintillation. This survey presents the overview of several key technologies, significance, demonstration, recent development, and implications of state-of-the-art criteria in terms of spectrum reuse, classification, architecture, physical layer security, and future applications for understanding FSO system among different appealing optical wireless technologies. In addition, the adaptive modulation, channel modeling schemes, relay-aided transmission, cooperative diversity, potential challenges, numerous mitigation techniques, and opportunities in the near future are also outlined to realize the successful deployment of FSO systems.}

Although, these developments have been well recognized at the application level, however crucial to the virtual training system is the effective and reliable measurement of training performance of the particular skill and handling the experiment for long-run. It is known that motor skills cannot be measured directly, but only inferred by observing behaviour or performance measures. The typical way of measuring performance is through measuring task completion time and accuracy, but can be supported by indirect measurement of some other factors. In this paper, a virtual crane training system has been developed which can be controlled using control commands extracted from facial gestures and is capable to lift up loads/materials in the virtual construction sites. Then, we integrate affective computing concept into the conventional VR training platform for measuring the cognitive load and level of satisfaction during performance using human's forehead bioelectric-signals. By employing the affective measures and our novel control scheme, the designed interface could be adapted to user's affective status during the performance in real-time. This adaptable user interface approach helps the trainee to cope with the training for long-run performance, leads to gaining more expertise and provides more effective transfer of learning to other operation environments. The detailed methodology of the affective control is presented in the paper. The results and future applications of the proposed method for disabled users, especially from neck down are discussed.}

abstract = {Although the benefit of participatory sensing for collecting local data over large areas has long been recognized, it has not been widely used for various applications such as disaster preparation due to a lack of geospatial localization capability with respect to a distant object. In such applications, objects of interest need to be robustly localized and documented for supporting data-driven decision-making in site inspection and resource mobilization. However, participatory sensing is inappropriate to localize a distant object due to the absence of ranging sensors in citizens' mobile devices; thus, the localization accuracy varies to a large extent. To address this issue, this study presents a novel geospatial localization method for distant objects based on participatory sensing. The proposed geospatial localization process consists of multiple computational modules—a geographic coordinate conversion, mean-shift clustering, deep learning-based object detection, magnetic declination adjustment, line of sight equation formulation, and the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse method—to improve the localization accuracy in participatory sensing environments. The experiments were conducted in Houston and College Station in Texas to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrated a reasonable localization accuracy, recording the distance errors of 1.5 m to 27.8 m when the distance from observers to the objects of interest were 17 m to 296 m. The proposed method is expected to contribute to rapid data collection over large urban areas, thereby facilitating disaster preparedness that needs to identify locations of distant objects at risk.}

In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure.}

Evacuation training using a virtual reality (VR)-based disaster simulator that provides a highly immersive simulated evacuation experience (SEE) has attracted significant attention. To improve the training effect, we propose a failure-enhanced evacuation training model based on Kolb’s experiential learning theory. Our model aims to purposefully induce participants to succumb to conformity bias and fail to evacuate during the first SEE because inactive evacuees (i.e., people who are not evacuating speedily or not starting their evacuation) are simulated in a VR-based disaster simulator. The participants are expected to overcome failure in the second SEE via reflection and conceptualization. A preliminary comparative experiment focused on how simulated evacuees influence the SEE of participants in a VR-based disaster simulator. Results indicated that failure-enhanced evacuation training can successfully improve the training effect.}

abstract = {During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (also known as COVID-19), workforce downsizing needs, safety requirements, supply chain breaks and inventory shortages affected manufacturing systems’ and supply chain’s responsiveness and resilience. Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

However, proper testing of new and innovative mobile support is hard for such operations. Evaluations in field settings are expensive, difficult to control, potentially dangerous, and may sometimes be impossible to execute. Using a virtual environment may solve these disadvantages of testing in the field. But how well does the performance with mobile support in a virtual environment predict the performance with the same mobile support in the real environment? To establish validity, patterns found in situation awareness, attention and performance in the virtual environment must match with patterns found in the field. This paper describes an experiment that compares these patterns for participants who search for objects in a virtual or field (real) environment. The virtual environment seemed to be sufficient in providing the prominent cues of the field environment that people use to navigate, but navigation itself proved to be far more easy in the field so that navigation support effects differed for both environments.}

The literature (153 articles) published over the past five years were collected and analyzed systematically, pertaining to the lifecycle model of the product–service system, i.e., design, development, evaluation, and applications. The review indicated that immersive systems and scenarios have been developed and applied in various transportation areas, such as air traffic management, autonomous vehicles, railways, highways, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, the review indicated that immersive technology brings significant benefits to the transportation field and induces significant changes in the interactions between humans and the physical world. These changes are expected to induce digital transformation in several aspects, e.g., digital testbeds for theoretical models and algorithms, immersive and safe digital environments for user studies, and digital training. Based on the review, a novel framework and conceptual lifecycle model of developing immersive technology-enabled digital transformation in transportation is proposed, a novel evaluation matrix for measuring the immersive experience level is established. The results provide essential references for practitioners to apply immersive technology and guidance regarding potential future research directions.}

Ad hoc networking concept is not a new one, having been around in various forms for over 20 years. Traditionally, tactical networks have been the only communication networking application that followed the ad hoc paradigm. Recently, the introduction of new technologies such as the Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and Hyperlan are helping enable eventual commercial MANET deployments outside the military domain. These recent evolutions have been generating a renewed and growing interest in the research and development of MANET. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of this dynamic field. It first explains the important role that mobile ad hoc networks play in the evolution of future wireless technologies. Then, it reviews the latest research activities in these areas, including a summary of MANET’s characteristics, capabilities, applications, and design constraints.

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be the most urgent problem the U.S. military is facing today. Pharmacological and psychological interventions reduce the severity of some PTSD symptoms however these conventional approaches have limited efficacy. This issue is compounded by the high rate of co-morbid traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other medical and psychiatric disorders in veterans diagnosed with PTSD and unresolved system-level problems within the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense healthcare services that interfere with adequate and prompt care for veterans and active duty military personnel. This paper is offered as a framework for interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration between experts in biomedicine and CAM addressing three primary areas of need: resiliency training in high risk military populations, prevention of PTSD following exposure to combat-related trauma, and treatment of established cases of PTSD. The evidence for widely used conventional pharmacological and psychological interventions used in the VA/DOD healthcare systems to treat PTSD is reviewed. Challenges and barriers to adequate assessment and treatment of PTSD in military personnel are discussed. A narrative review of promising CAM modalities used to prevent or treat PTSD emphasizes interventions that are not widely used in VA/DOD clinics and programmes. Interventions reviewed include virtual reality graded exposure therapy (VRGET), brain–computer interface (BCI), EEG biofeedback, cardiac coherence training, EMDR, acupuncture, omega-3 fatty acids and other natural products, lucid dreaming training, and energy therapies. As meditation and mind-body practices are widely offered within VA/DOD programmes and services addressing PTSD the evidence for these modalities is only briefly reviewed. Sources included mainstream medical databases and journals not currently indexed in the mainstream medical databases. Although most interventions discussed are applicable to both civilian and military populations the emphasis is on military personnel. Provisional integrative guidelines are offered with the goal of providing a flexible and open framework when planning interventions aimed at preventing or treating PTSD based on the best available evidence for both conventional and CAM approaches. The paper concludes with recommendations on research and policy within the VA and DOD healthcare systems addressing urgent unmet needs associated with PTSD.}

abstract = {Objective
Virtual (VR), augmented (AR), mixed reality (MR) and haptic interfaces make additional avenues available for surgeon assessment, guidance and training. We evaluated applications for open trauma and emergency surgery to address the question: Have new computer-supported interface developments occurred that could improve trauma training for civilian and military surgeons performing open, emergency, non-laparoscopic surgery?
Design
Systematic literature review.
Setting and Participants
Faculty, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore., Maryland; Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.
Methods
Structured literature searches identified studies using terms for virtual, augmented, mixed reality and haptics, as well as specific procedures in trauma training courses. Reporting bias was assessed. Study quality was evaluated by the Kirkpatrick's Level of evidence and the Machine Learning to Asses Surgical Expertise (MLASE) score.
Results
Of 422 papers identified, 14 met inclusion criteria, included 282 enrolled subjects, 20% were surgeons, the remainder students, medics and non-surgeon physicians. Study design was poor and sample sizes were low. No data analyses were beyond descriptive and the highest outcome types were procedural success, subjective self-reports, except three studies used validated metrics. Among the 14 studies, Kirkpatrick's level of evidence was level zero in five studies, level 1 in 8 and level 2 in one. Only one study had MLASE Score greater than 9/20. There was a high risk of bias in 6 studies, uncertain bias in 5 studies and low risk of bias in 3 studies.
Conclusions
There was inadequate evidence that VR,MR,AR or haptic interfaces can facilitate training for open trauma surgery or replace cadavers. Because of limited testing in surgeons, deficient study and technology design, risk of reporting bias, no current well-designed studies of computer-supported technologies have shown benefit for open trauma, emergency surgery nor has their use shown improved patient outcomes. Larger more rigorously designed studies and evaluations by experienced surgeons are required for a greater variety of procedures and skills.

Possibilities of the application are, among others: selection of visibility level of certain organs or groups of organs, creation of complex sections in 3 planes and launching animations of selected organs. Application of each selected device required additional programming work. The work included both adaptation of Graphical User Interface for different display resolutions, as well as preparation of communication between integrated orientation tracking systems and the application, because none of the selected low-cost HMDs has a position tracking system, to allow navigation in the virtual space, two low-cost solutions were proposed, as well as traditional approach in form of a professional tracking system. First of the proposed low-cost solutions is application of a dedicated, customized controller built in the PUT VR Laboratory using commercial electronics and 3D printing technologies. The second solution is controlling the navigation via specific gestures recognized by the Kinect low-cost tracking device. After application was developed, a group of students tested all possibilities of interaction with the virtual environment using a professional HMD and both low-cost display and tracking solutions. During the evaluation performed by the test group, features like field of view, weight of devices and general impressions and feeling after prolonged use were taken into consideration. Intuitiveness of the proposed navigation solutions was evaluated separately. The evaluation performed by the test group can be used during work on subsequent versions of the medical educational application and design of new peripheral devices.}

In particular, automated monitoring of construction sites is a significant research challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on the real-time monitoring of construction projects. The review focuses on sensor technologies and methodologies for real-time mapping, scene understanding, positioning, and tracking of construction activities in indoor and outdoor environments.

The key concern from the literature is VR-induced sickness, experienced by a large proportion of VR participants, but for the majority these effects are mild and subside quickly. This paper makes a number of recommendations regarding the future direction of research into health and safety implications of VR, including the need to take into account the way in which VR is being used when conducting empirical research: first, to ensure that studies consider both effects and their consequences; second, to ensure that empirical trials reflect the actual likely context of VR use; third, to consider interactions between effects; and finally, to consider ways in which effects can be managed.}

The majority of the existing indoor evacuation systems provide emergency guidance for people trapped in general buildings. However, those systems fail to consider the unique challenges of ship passenger evacuation, such as the effect of ship motion on pedestrian motion and the feedback of pedestrian motion on ship inclination state. Consequently, evacuation guidance provided by these schemes may not always be optimal or may even make the evacuation worse due to the differences in the critical factors influencing emergency guiding between land-based buildings and passenger ships. This paper presents a systematic literature overview of recent advances in building evacuation, followed by a description of the challenges unique to evacuating passengers on vessels. Furthermore, the existing ship evacuation research is reviewed from three aspects, i.e., passenger behavior study, ship evacuation optimization, and evaluation of evacuation on passenger ships. A discussion of land-based evacuation schemes and prospects for ship evacuation is also presented.}

Peri- and post-traumatic factors predict the differential development of stress-associated mental disorders. Prospective designs assessing these risk factors in real-time under controlled experimental conditions can overcome limitations of retrospective designs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate multi-sensory, experimental analogues of a traumatic experience delivered in Virtual Reality (VR) or Script-Driven Imagery (SDI).
Methods
In a randomised controlled crossover design, differences in the induced analogue trauma symptoms between multi-sensory analogue trauma by either VR or SDI versus a neutral condition were assessed in 127 non-clinical participants.
Results
Analogue symptoms (psychophysiological responses, coping behaviour and intrusive memories of the experimental trauma) increased following analogue trauma in both VR and SDI, with more analogue symptoms for VR. Psychophysiological arousal was in general higher in VR.
Limitations
The analogue trauma situation of a car park fire that was used may be infrequent in real life.
Conclusions
Multisensory (vision, olfaction, hearing) analogue trauma in VR and SDI offers a useful tool for the induction and real-time assessment of peri- and post-traumatic risk factors for analogue stress-associated psychopathology. VR was more effective in inducing analogue symptoms than SDI, even though the latter might be more personalised. New experimental models for studying trauma exposure and responses may contribute to a better understanding of risk factors and help to identify and protect individuals at risk.}

In the present experiment, participants’ risk tolerance was measured using questionnaires, and their route choices were recorded when they evacuated from a virtual building under different smoke scenarios. A high density of smoke reduced the use of a smoky shortcut but did not prevent some participants from using the shortcut. Participants with high-risk tolerance were more likely to take a risky shortcut. However, individual attitude towards risk is unstable; hence, the risk preference revealed in daily behaviors under a low-danger context may not reveal individual risky decisions in face of high hazards. Moreover, neighbor behavior also had a significant impact on participants’ risky decisions. The implications of our findings on evacuation training and management and evacuation simulation models were also discussed.}

abstract = {Live-line maintenance is a high risk activity. Hence, lineworkers require effective and safe training. Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees’ final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees’ trace data through a visualization tool to pose non-observable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees’ final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.}

Recent technological developments have drawn researchers and manufacturers to look ahead at introducing automated driving in cities. The current position paper examines this challenge from the viewpoint of scientific experts. Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.}

abstract = {In professional training programs, how to help learners fully understand the contexts and problem-solving procedure in the workplace is a crucial and challenging issue. Due to the advancements of computer and multimedia technology, many professional training programs have applied technology to provide richer learning content. Blended learning is a learning approach combining online and physical courses. In the blended learning mode, learners can not only learn through multimedia teaching materials, but also interact and practice with teachers and students in online and physical classrooms. However, the conventional blended learning (C-BL) mode mainly presents teaching content through online videos and physical courses. In such a learning environment with one-way information transmission and without experience, it is not easy for most learners to experience the actual situations encountered in the professional training process, which affects their judgment and actual handling performance. In order to tackle this problem, this research adopted spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) technology and applied it in a general registered nurse (RN) training program via a blended learning mode. To verify the effects of this teaching approach, a quasi-experimental study was conducted in a RN training program in a large-scale hospital. The experimental group employed the SVVR-BL mode while the control group employed the C-BL mode. The results indicated that the SVVR-BL mode could not only improve learners' learning achievement, but also enhance their problem-solving tendency, meta-cognition tendency, and classroom engagement. The practical skills test results in the workplace further implied that, compared to the learners who adopted the C-BL mode, learners who adopted the SVVR-BL mode had better judgment, analysis, and overall performance of the handling process when encountering practical problems. As a result, SVVR-BL not only helped learners gain knowledge and improve their higher order thinking, but also assisted them in applying what they had learned to solve real problems. This result can serve as an important reference for SVVR-BL studies and the design of professional training programs in the future.}

However, with existing methods, the modeling process is occupied with complex data collection and tedious parameter adjustment, lacking a rich sensory modeling experience. In this paper, we propose an approach to sketch-based tree modeling in an immersive virtual reality environment, aiming to lower the difficulty of modeling and enhance the immersion in the designing process. We first present a sketch sampling and points optimization algorithm to obtain the skeleton of the branch in 3D space. As generating geometry along the skeleton, we apply a vector-projection method to fix the branch polygon twisting. Then, we introduce a bidirectional ray-hit algorithm to determine the branch radius as real-time sketching. To generate random twigs on branches, we introduce a twigs generation algorithm based on Perlin noise and the parent branch direction. Finally, we design a series of interactive methods for users to create tree models in a 3D virtual scene with the VR HMD and controller. Experimental results indicate that our approach can accomplish creating realistic tree models in real-time. The interactive and immersive modeling experience enables users to readily convey their ideas on tree structures in a simple and direct way of sketching. Visualizing and modifying the real-time generated branch results can contribute to provoking the inspiration for creation.}

Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.
Industrial relevance
The need for sensory evaluation within the food industry is becoming increasingly complex as companies continuously compete for consumer product acceptance in today's highly innovative and global food environment. Recent technological developments in virtual and augmented reality offer the food industry new opportunities for generating more reliable insights into consumer sensory perceptions of food and beverages, contributing to the design and development of new products with optimised consumer benefits. These technologies also hold significant potential for improving the predictive validity of newly launched products within the marketplace.}

The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

abstract = {While much research has focused on the deleterious effects of stress on goal-directed behavior in recent decades, current views increasingly discuss growth under stress, often assuming dose-dependent effects of stress in a curvilinear association. This is based on the concept of hormesis, which postulates a strengthening effect of stress at low-to-moderate doses. Leveraging this approach, hormetic curves indicate under which stress dose an individual is able to maintain or even increase goal-directed behavior. The present study aimed to test the hormetic effect of low-to-moderate stress on tactical movement performance in the context of police operational scenarios in virtual reality. In teams of three to four, 37 riot police officers had to search a building for a potentially aggressive perpetrator in three scenarios with escalating stress potential (i.e., increasing weapon violence and number of civilians). Tactical movement performance as behavioral response was quantified by the sample entropy of each officer's velocity derived from positional data. To account for inter-individuality in response to the scenarios, we assessed self-reported stress, anxiety, mental effort, and vagally mediated heart rate variability. Specifically, we tested the quadratic associations between tactical movement performance and stress parameters, respectively. Random-intercept-random-slope regressions revealed neither significant linear nor quadratic associations between any of the stress parameters and performance. While we did not find evidence for hormesis in the present study, it stimulates theoretical discussions about the definition of “baseline” functioning and how the understanding of hormesis can move from psychological to behavioral adaptations to stressors.}

abstract = {Pedestrians are usually referred to as the most vulnerable road users because they lack sound protection against crashes. The danger of collisions for pedestrians increases at intersection crosswalks due to the non-compliance behaviour of pedestrians at such multi-directional traffic locations. To acquire a greater comprehension, it is indeed imperative to understand pedestrian behaviour at such sites. Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the risk associated with non-compliance behaviour and the primary causes of non-compliance behaviour at intersections. The study also explored the relationship between time pressure and non-compliance road crossing behaviour. The authors searched the Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Semantic to identify the required studies. After excluding books, review papers, non-English research, proceedings, duplicates, and irrelevant studies, 73 pieces of literature were identified for the review process. The current study enlisted all the elements that influence the non-compliance behaviour of pedestrians. Many factors, such as time of day, weather conditions, land use, etc., have a substantial effect on non-compliance but have not been sufficiently studied to establish broad conclusions. Consequently, in exploring the fundamental reasons for non-compliance behaviour, it was found that time--saving or being in a hurry is one of the strong influencers for non-compliance behaviour. Hence, these findings indicate a positive correlation between time pressure and the non-compliance behaviour of pedestrians. However, even though time pressure is a primary source of non-compliance, studies illustrating the impact of time pressure on pedestrian decision-making behaviour are extremely limited. Furthermore, because all time pressure studies have been limited to midblock crossings, it is worthwhile to assess the role of time pressure in pedestrian safety in complex intersection scenarios.}

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

Physiological measures were recorded and used to validate the efficacy of VR in inducing anxiety germane to the situation of interest. Consistent with our expectations, providing information about the obstacle was shown to decrease total evacuation time. Contrary to our predictions, it did not significantly impact evacuees' choice of exit. Information also had a marginally significant effect on participants' self-reported anxiety. Providing more targeted information may further reduce anxiety and evacuation time. More generally, VR appears well-suited to assessing individual and psychological factors in evacuations.}

Unfortunately, they are poorly understood and often ignored by people. Virtual environments (VEs) could be a more effective method to support people in acquiring spatial knowledge about the real-world environment to evacuate. This paper pursues three main goals. First, we propose a VE-based tool to support spatial knowledge acquisition for evacuation purposes, using aviation as a real-world domain in which such knowledge is crucial for passengers’ safety. Second, we study in detail one of the VE design choices (active or passive navigation), comparing a version of our tool in which users navigate by actively controlling their position with another version in which users are passively led along pre-defined routes. Third, we contrast the two versions of the tool with the traditional, printed diagrammatic map provided to passengers by airlines. Results of our study show that the VE-based approach produces objectively better spatial knowledge when users are asked to pinpoint their assigned position in the environment, and that active navigation produces a performance improvement in a subsequent virtual evacuation. Moreover, the VE-based approach is perceived as more enjoyable, easier to comprehend and more effective than printed maps when active navigation is available.}

Lack of training contributes to the burden of trauma-related mortality and morbidity in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Educational technologies present a unique opportunity to enhance the quality of trauma training. Therefore, this study reviews current technologies used in trauma courses and evaluates their feasibility for LMICs.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review evaluating the learning outcomes of technology-enhanced training in general trauma assessment, team skills or any procedures covered in the 2020 Advanced Trauma Life Support® program. Based on the Technology-Enhanced Learning criteria, we created and applied a feasibility analysis tool to evaluate the technologies for use in LMICs.
Results
We screened 6471 articles and included 64. Thirty-four (45%) articles explored training in general trauma assessment, 28 (37%) in team skills, and 24 (32%) in procedures. The most common technologies were high-fidelity mannequins (60%), video-assisted debriefing (19%), and low-fidelity mannequins (13%). Despite their effectiveness, high-fidelity mannequins ranked poorly in production, maintenance, cost, and reusability categories, therefore being poorly suited for LMICs. Virtual simulation and digital courses had the best feasibility scores, but still represented a minority of articles in our review.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform a feasibility analysis of trauma training technologies in the LMIC context. We identified that the majority of trauma courses in the literature use technologies which are less suitable for LMICs. Given the urgent need for pediatric trauma training, educators must use technologies that optimize learning outcomes and remain feasible for low-resource settings.

abstract = {In this paper, a hand exoskeleton system for virtual reality is proposed. As a virtual reality interface for the hand, a wearable system should be able to measure the finger joint angles and apply force feedback to the fingers at the same time with a simple and light structure. In the proposed system, two different cable mechanisms are applied to achieve such requirements; three finger joint angles in the direction of the flexion/extension (F/E) motion are measured by a tendon-inspired cable mechanism and another cable is used for force feedback to the finger for one degree of freedom (DOF) actuation per finger. As two different types of cables are used, the system is termed a dual-cable hand exoskeleton system. Using the measured finger joint angles and motor current, the cable-driven actuation system applies the desired force to the fingers. That is, when the desired force is zero, the motor position is controlled to follow the finger posture while maintaining the appropriate cable slack; when the desired force needs to be applied, the motor current is controlled to generate the desired force. To achieve a smooth transition between the two control strategies, the control inputs were linearly integrated; and the desired motor position was generated to prevent a sudden motor rotation. A prototype of the proposed system was manufactured with a weight of 320g, a volume of 13 × 23 × 8cm3, maximum force up to 5 N. The proposed control algorithms were verified by experiments with virtual reality applications.}

Existing literature at the intersection of these two topics supports environmental modeling (e.g., terrain understanding) for context enhanced applications. Taking advantage of sensor models, statistical methods, and situation- specific spatio-temporal fusion products derived from wide area sensor networks, DDDAS demonstrates robust multi-scale and multi-resolution geographical terrain computations. We highlight the complementary nature of these seemingly parallel approaches and propose a more integrated analytical framework in the context of a cooperative multimodal sensing application. In particular, we use a Wide-Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) application to draw parallels and contrasts between IF and DDDAS systems that warrants an integrated perspective. This elementary work is aimed at triggering a sequence of deeper insightful research towards exploiting sparsely sampled piecewise dense WAMI measurements – an application where the challenges of big-data with regards to mathematical fusion relationships and high-performance computations remain significant and will persist. Dynamic data-driven adaptive computations are required to effectively handle the challenges with exponentially increasing data volume for advanced information fusion systems solutions such as simultaneous target tracking and identification.}

A sample of 51 university students were administered written learning material in a between-subjects design study, wherein one group read text about sarcoma cancer on a physical pamphlet in the real world, and the other group read identical text on a virtual pamphlet embedded in an immersive VR environment which resembled a hospital room. The study combined advanced EEG measurement techniques, learning tests, and cognitive load measures to compare conditions. Results show that the VR group performed significantly better on a knowledge transfer post-test. However, reading in VR was found to be more cognitively effortful and less time-efficient. Findings suggest the significance of environmental embeddedness for learning, and provide important considerations for the design of educational VR environments, as we remediate learning content from non-immersive to immersive media.}

With the continuously rising number of flights available, both domestically and internationally, it is conceivable that the number of IFMEs will similarly continue to rise. Although most of these instances are relatively self-limited, the rare instance of a severe occurrence justifies preparation, both from in-flight staff and healthcare providers traveling on these flights. Given these events' sporadic nature and the variable availability of medical support, all physicians need to understand their in-flight ethical and legal capabilities, the available medical supplies, and the most likely etiologies to manage such situations successfully. Most radiologists rarely utilize the hands-on, clinical skills developed in medical school or internship for emergencies beyond allergic contrast reactions. Therefore, they may not be adept in caring for patients during an IFME. As such, we present a thorough overview and literature review for the radiologist regarding the management of various acute IFMEs, with consideration for ethical and legal precedence and a review of medical equipment available on-board.}

We developed a Dynamic Risk-based Early wArning Monitoring (DREAM) system using large-scale, real-time electronic health record data from 2010 to 2020 from the CHinese Electronic health Records Research in Yinzhou study. The dynamic risk scores were derived from a 1:5 matched nested case–control set comprising 70,470 individuals (11,745 CVD events) and then validated in a cohort of 81,205 individuals (5950 CVD events). The individuals were Chinese adults aged 40–79 years without a history of CVD at baseline. Eleven predictors related to vital signs, laboratory tests, and health service utilization were selected to establish the dynamic scores. The proposed scores were significantly associated with the subsequent CVD onset (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.23). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) was 0.6010 (0.5929–0.6092) and 0.6021 (0.5937–0.6105) for the long-term 10-year CVD risk <10% and ≥10% groups in the derivation set, respectively. In the long-term 10-year CVD risk ≥10% group in the validation set, the change in AUC in addition to the long-term risk was 0.0235 (0.0155–0.0315). By increasing the risk threshold from 7 to 16 points, the proportion of true subsequent CVD cases among those given alerts increased from 40.61% to 85.31%. In terms of management efficiency, the number needed to manage per CVD case ranged from 2.46 to 1.17 using the risk scores. With the increasing popularity and integration of EHR systems with wearable technology, the DREAM scores can be incorporated into an early-warning system and applied in dynamic, real-time, EHR-based, automated management to support healthcare decision making for individuals, general practitioners, and policymakers.}

This paper summarizes the research on the human body and environment based energy harvesting techniques, including solar, thermal, Radio frequency (RF) energy, kinetic energy, and biomass energy. We deeply analyze the application potential and limitations of each new energy harvesting technology and summarize the relationship between the energy required by wearables and the new energy harvesting systems. Solar and kinetic energy generation technologies have higher energy density and are suitable for application in outdoor sports wearables. RF energy, thermal energy, and biomass energy have less energy dense and can be used as auxiliary power sources for small wearables.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a survey data from young consumers. Structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate the proposed research model. Results demonstrate that 1) the DSI construct must be examined in the two dimensions so that it can properly measure the nature and characteristics of DSI, 2) IPI plays an important role, having a positive effect on all four perceived attributes of IT innovations, 3) PPI has a positive effect on perceived social image and perceived novelty, and finally 4) all perceived attributes of IT innovations have a positive effect on consumers’ purchase intention of wearable devices.

Initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using an automated external defibrillator (AED) are critical for survival, yet many bystanders are reluctant to intervene. Digital technologies, including mobile devices, social media, and crowdsourcing might help play a role to improve survival from SCA. In this article we review the current digital tools and strategies available to increase rates of bystander recognition of SCA, prompt immediate activation of emergency medical services (EMS), initiate high-quality CPR, and to locate, retrieve, and operate AEDs. Smartphones can help to educate and connect bystanders with EMS dispatchers, through text messaging or video calling, to encourage the initiation of CPR and retrieval of the closest AED. Wearable devices and household smart speakers could play a future role in continuous vital signs monitoring in individuals at risk of lethal arrhythmias and send an alert to either chosen contacts or EMS. Machine learning algorithms and mathematical modelling might aid EMS dispatchers with better recognition of SCA as well as policymakers with where to best place AEDs for optimal accessibility. There are challenges with the use of digital tech, including the need for government regulation and issues with data ownership, accessibility, and interoperability. Future research will include smart cities, e-linkages, new technologies, and using social media for mass education. Together or in combination, these emerging digital technologies might represent the next leap forward in SCA survival.
Résumé
L'arrêt cardiaque soudain (ACS) est un événement courant, qui touche près de 400 000 personnes chaque année en Amérique du Nord. La mise en place de la réanimation cardiorespiratoire (RCR) et de la défibrillation précoce à l'aide d'un défibrillateur externe automatisé (DEA) sont essentielles à la survie, mais de nombreux passants hésitent à intervenir. Les technologies numériques, notamment les appareils mobiles, les médias sociaux et la création participative pourraient contribuer à améliorer la survie après un ACS. Dans cet article, nous passons en revue les outils numériques actuels et les stratégies disponibles pour augmenter les taux d'identification d'un ACS par les passants, l'activation immédiate des services médicaux d'urgence (SMU), le déclenchement d'une RCR de qualité et la localisation, la récupération et le fonctionnement des DEA. Les téléphones intelligents peuvent contribuer à éduquer les témoins d'un ACS et à les mettre en relation avec les répartiteurs des SMU, par le biais de messages texte ou d'appels vidéo, afin d'encourager le déclenchement de la RCR et la récupération du DEA le plus proche. Les dispositifs portables et les haut-parleurs domestiques intelligents pourraient à l'avenir jouer un rôle dans la surveillance continue des signes vitaux chez les personnes présentant un risque d'arythmies mortelles et envoyer une alerte à des contacts prédéfinis ou aux SMU. Les algorithmes d'apprentissage automatique et la modélisation mathématique pourraient aider les répartiteurs des SMU à mieux reconnaître les ACS et les décideurs à déterminer où placer les DEA pour une accessibilité optimale. L'utilisation des technologies numériques présente des défis, notamment la nécessité d'une réglementation gouvernementale et des questions de propriété, d'accessibilité et d'interopérabilité des données. Les futures recherches porteront sur les villes intelligentes, les liens électroniques, les nouvelles technologies et l'utilisation des médias sociaux pour l'éducation de masse. Ensemble ou en combinaison, ces technologies numériques émergentes pourraient représenter le prochain bond en avant quant à la survie à un ACS.}

abstract = {Background
Early detection of atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) may enable prevention of downstream morbidity. Consumer wrist-worn wearable technology is capable of detecting AF by identifying irregular pulse waveforms using photoplethysmography (PPG). The validity of PPG-based software algorithms for AF detection requires prospective assessment.
Methods
The Fitbit Heart Study (NCT04380415) is a single-arm remote clinical trial examining the validity of a novel PPG-based software algorithm for detecting AF. The proprietary Fitbit algorithm examines pulse waveform intervals during analyzable periods in which participants are sufficiently stationary. Fitbit consumers with compatible wrist-worn trackers or smartwatches were invited to participate. Enrollment began May 6, 2020 and as of October 1, 2020, 455,699 participants enrolled. Participants in whom an irregular heart rhythm was detected were invited to attend a telehealth visit and eligible participants were then mailed a one-week single lead electrocardiographic (ECG) patch monitor. The primary study objective is to assess the positive predictive value of an irregular heart rhythm detection for AF during the ECG patch monitor period. Additional objectives will examine the validity of irregular pulse tachograms during subsequent heart rhythm detections, self-reported AF diagnoses and treatments, and relations between irregular heart rhythm detections and AF episode duration and time spent in AF.
Conclusions
The Fitbit Heart Study is a large-scale remote clinical trial comprising a unique software algorithm for detection of AF. The study results will provide critical insights into the use of consumer wearable technology for AF detection, and for characterizing the nature of AF episodes detected using consumer-based PPG technology.}

This paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the current research advancements in IoT forensics. We define key IoT fundamentals, IoT applications, the need for IoT forensics, identify the key factors affecting IoT forensics, and review the practicality of the available IoT forensics frameworks, models, and methodologies. The SLR reveals research gaps indicating that most of the current research is more theoretical than practical. There is a need for more practical approaches to tackle the unique IoT forensics challenges. Finally, for future research directions from the SLR, we have highlighted and discussed the open challenges and requirements for IoT forensics.}

That ‘perfect storm’ exacerbates the risk of occupational heat illness, yet first responders must perform physically demanding work wearing personal-protective clothing and equipment. Unfortunately, the Eurocentric emphasis of past research has sometimes reduced its applicability to other ethnic groups. To redress that imbalance, relevant contemporary research has been reviewed, to which has been added information applicable to people of Asian, Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry. An epidemiological triad is used to identify the causal agents and host factors of work intolerance within hot-humid climates, commencing with the size dependency of resting metabolism and heat production accompanying load carriage, followed by a progression from the impact of single-layered clothing through to encapsulating ensembles. A morphological hypothesis is presented to account for inter-individual differences in heat production and heat loss, which seems to explain apparent ethnic- and gender-related differences in thermoregulation, at least within thermally compensable states. The mechanisms underlying work intolerance, cardiovascular insufficiency and heat illness are reviewed, along with epidemiological data from the Asia-Pacific. Finally, evidence-based preventative and treatment strategies are presented and updated concerning moisture-management fabrics and barriers, dehydration, pre- and post-exercise cooling, and heat adaptation. An extensive reference list is provided, with >25 recommendations enabling physiologists, occupational health specialists, policy makers, purchasing officers and manufacturers to rapidly extract interpretative outcomes pertinent to the Asia-Pacific.}

Laypeople should be trained in basic life support and traditional and innovative methodologies may help to obtain this goal. However, there is a knowledge gap about the ideal basic life support training methods. Smart glasses could have a role facilitating laypeople learning of basic life support.
Aim
To analyze the potential impact on basic life support learning of a very brief training supported by smart glasses video communication.
Methods
Twelve laypeople were basic life support tele-trained by means of smart glasses by an instructor in this pilot study. During training (assisted trough smart glasses) and after the training (unassisted) participants’ performance and quality of basic life support and automated external defibrillation procedure were assessed on a standardized simulated scenario.
Results
After the training all participants were able to deliver good quality basic life support, with results comparable to those obtained when real time remotely guided by the instructor through the smart glasses. Mean chest compression rate was significantly higher when not guided (113 /min vs. 103 /min, p = 0.001). When not assisted, the participants spent less time delivering the sequential basic life support steps than when assisted while training.
Conclusions
A very brief remote training supported by instructor and smart glasses seems to be an effective educational method that could facilitate basic life support learning by laypeople. This technology could be considered in cases where instructors are not locally available or in general in remote areas, providing basic internet connection is available. Smart glasses could also be useful for laypeople rolling-refreshers.}

While adopted for their convenience outside of the healthcare sector, these invasive, semi-permanent implantable devices create augmented bodies that can be subject to ubiquitous surveillance. Situating human microchip implantations within surveillance literature, we draw from neoliberal perspectives of surveillance to examine augmented bodies, particularly as sources for market activity and as subjects of social control and sorting when these bodies are used as access control mechanisms, payment methods, and tracking means in employment, residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. History has demonstrated time and time again how unfettered technology applications and uses have led to real and/or perceived misuse by private and public sectors. Through the lens of function creep, we identify a pattern of expansion of applications and uses of technology beyond those originally intended across new technologies, such as DNA genetic genealogy databases, IoT wearables, and COVID-19 contact tracing apps, and provide illustrative examples of function creep, particularly the use of these technologies in criminal investigations and prosecutions despite not being intended or marketed for such use. By demonstrating the lack of clearly defined boundaries in the applications and uses of various new technologies and their associated data, and the ways they were misused, we demonstrate how human microchip implantations are headed on a similar path. The current and potential future uses of this technology raise concerns about the absence of regulation, law, and policy barring or limiting its application and use in specific sectors, and the impact of this technology on users’ security, data protection, and privacy. Undeniably, the present and potential future functions, applications, uses, and extensions of human microchip implantations in various sectors warrant a proactive examination of their security, privacy, and data protection consequences and the implementation of proactive policies to regulate new and currently unregulated uses of this technology and its associated data within these sectors.}

keywords = {Chest X-ray, Interpretation, Novel technology, Telemedicine},
abstract = {Objectives
We sought to explore the accuracy of remote chest X-ray reading using hands-free, wearable technology (Google Glass, Google, Mountain View, California).
Methods
We compared interpretation of twelve chest X-rays with 23 major cardiopulmonary findings by faculty and fellows from cardiology, radiology, and pulmonary-critical care via: (1) viewing the chest X-ray image on the Google Glass screen; (2) viewing a photograph of the chest X-ray taken using Google Glass and interpreted on a mobile device; (3) viewing the original chest X-ray on a desktop computer screen. One point was given for identification of each correct finding and a subjective rating of user experience was recorded.
Results
Fifteen physicians (5 faculty and 10 fellows) participated. The average chest X-ray reading score (maximum 23 points) as viewed through the Google Glass, Google Glass photograph on a mobile device, and the original X-ray viewed on a desktop computer was 14.1±2.2, 18.5±1.5 and 21.3±1.7, respectively (p<0.0001 between Google Glass and mobile device, p<0.0001 between Google Glass and desktop computer and p=0.0004 between mobile device and desktop computer). Of 15 physicians, 11 (73.3%) felt confident in detecting findings using the photograph taken by Google Glass as viewed on a mobile device.
Conclusion
Remote chest X-ray interpretation using hands-free, wearable technology (Google Glass) is less accurate than interpretation using a desktop computer or a mobile device, suggesting that further technical improvements are needed before widespread application of this novel technology.}

Deep Learning (DL), blockchain and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), three of the most revolutionary technologies, have aided replace conventional practice employed in the healthcare industry with more sophisticated and efficient procedures. In this research, we propose DON-B-STRESSED (DBS), an innovative framework which integrates DL, blockchain and IoMT technologies to provide a method for the early detection of stress in users donning IoMT devices. Long-term stress, indeed, is well-known to have profound consequences on human wellbeing; hence the need for automated solutions for continual stress monitoring. DON-B-STRESSED stands for DON a Blockchain-based, Secure, Timely, REliable System for StrEss Detection: the premise behind this is that if the above-mentioned technologies can be combined, a system that employs IoMT for users' data collection, DL to properly predict patients' stress levels, and smart contracts deployed on blockchain to ensure secure transactions and health checks, the well-known concerns of harmful effects of long-term stress might be avoided. By using multimodal data from both a chest- and a wrist-worn IoMT device, we have developed a tailored, secure, accurate yet fast real-time system for the early detection of stress signs. The DL part has been evaluated on WESAD, a publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection, reaching an accuracy of more than 99% with LOSO generalization scheme. Furthermore, the scalability and reliability of DON-B-STRESSED are shown by comparison with the findings of past research.}

This paper proposes a futures-based, iterative policy-informed design framework for developing wearable devices that guides interdisciplinary collaborators early in the process of designing a research & development plan.

Wearable extractive devices are promising tools that are present in the analytical toolbox and address the abovementioned needs. These devices consist of a particular class of samplers that an individual can wear without limiting her/his daily life activities. In addition to being wearable, these devices show the ability to preconcentrate the analytes in an extractive phase while integrating the sampling and sample preparation. In addition to being imperative for personal exposure investigations, applications in diagnostic and prognostic health monitoring are among their emerging applications. Besides, in vivo soft samplers based on microextraction techniques provide non-invasive to low invasive approaches for non-lethal monitoring of various biosystems. Although in these applications they are not used in an ‘obvious way’ as wearable devices as they are not placed directly on the subject's skin and are instead immersed under the skin, in the scope of this review they will still be considered to provide a picture for future directions of extractive wearable devices. This review aims to cover the wearable extractive devices used in exposure studies (with a special focus on the last two years), in vivo, and in situ applications (with a focus on the last five years) where reliable information about the system is under interest.}

Endowing a robotic system with vision and tactile capabilities, similar to those of medical professionals, and thus enabling robots to assess a patient’s status in an emergency is a highly sought after characteristic in healthcare robotics. This paper presents a novel fuzzy triage system exploiting visual and tactile sensing, to equip a robot with the skills to accurately determine key vital signs in humans. There are three key signs of human health: respiratory rate, pulse rate (Beats Per Minute (BPM)) and capillary refill time. Using ground truth from a medical professional, the fuzzy triage system is trained and validated initially with informed synthetic data and then further evaluated using vital signs data collected from subjects in a pilot study. Results from this pilot study indicate that the fuzzy triage system is capable of classifying a patient’s health using the novel approaches for collecting BPM, Respiratory Rate (RR) and Capillary Refill Time (CRT) which replicate, to some extent, the approaches used by medical professionals for measuring vital signs. Furthermore, the intelligent system proved capable of determining whether a pulse was regular or arrhythmic, whether respiratory rate was regular or irregular, and determining the subject’s capillary refill time. Such results imply that this system could ultimately be used, for example, in a home assistance robot for elderly or disabled persons, or as a first responder robot. Ultimately the aim would be that these methods could be utilised by robotic systems in emergency scenarios or disaster zones.}

For self-report, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), as implemented on contemporary smartphones or personal digital assistants, can provide researchers with near-real-time information on participants' behavior and mood in their natural environments. Data from portable/wearable electronic sensors measuring participants' internal and external environments can be combined with EMA (e.g., by timestamps recorded on questionnaires) to provide objective information useful in determining the momentary context of behavior and mood and/or validating participants' self-reports. Here, we review three objective ambulatory monitoring techniques that have been combined with EMA, with a focus on detecting drug use and/or measuring the behavioral or physiological correlates of mental events (i.e., emotions, cognitions): (1) collection and processing of biological samples in the field to measure drug use or participants' physiological activity (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity); (2) global positioning system (GPS) location information to link environmental characteristics (disorder/disadvantage, retail drug outlets) to drug use and affect; (3) ambulatory electronic physiological monitoring (e.g., electrocardiography) to detect drug use and mental events, as advances in machine learning algorithms make it possible to distinguish target changes from confounds (e.g., physical activity). Finally, we consider several other mobile/wearable technologies that hold promise to be combined with EMA, as well as potential challenges faced by researchers working with multiple mobile/wearable technologies simultaneously in the field.}

abstract = {The research and development of wearable sensors have gained a growing interest due to the advantage of being flexible, thin, and light, which makes them highly desirable for robotic and healthcare applications. One of the essential devices in wearable technology is flexible temperature sensors for body temperature detection. Recent advances in flexible temperature sensors based on nanomaterials and conductive polymers are evaluated in this review. The temperature-responsive mechanisms, temperature-sensitive materials, and production methods of temperature sensors and recent outcomes of related papers are explained and classified in a detailed perspective. The flexible temperature sensors based on nanomaterial-filled polymer composites, printed/coated conductors, and textiles are explained in terms of structures and performances by giving examples from recent literature studies. The reliability and challenges of flexible temperature sensors are outlined from the point of view of structural design and implementation.}

The amplified integration of technology with society, however, continues to present new challenges for law enforcement officers. This issue is evident in one of the key responsibilities of police agencies involves the enforcement of traffic laws and regulations on surface streets and highways. It is unclear how well first responders recognize the need to seize digital evidence associated with fatal vehicles accidents in the field. This study addressed this gap in the literature by examining a comparative population of respondents from the state police agencies in a large Midwestern and large Southern state. Using a vignette design, the findings demonstrated that respondents recognized the need to recover mobile devices and telematics from the vehicles involved in fatal crashes. A substantive number of officers remained unsure of the potential digital evidentiary value of other objects on-scene (e.g., fast food, makeup). Further, regional differences were observed in respondents’ responses. The implications for our understanding of police capacity and training needs were explored in detail.}

In these regions, the rapid adoption and development of IoT produce a large amount of evidence. For instance, IoT devices such as cameras capture the different facial emotions of drivers in Autonomous driving systems. In completely autonomous vehicles, drivers have trouble in takeover transfers as they become disconnected from the actual aspect of driving. Factors affecting takeover effectiveness, such as lead time and the participation of non-driving-related tasks, have been concentrated. Nevertheless, considering the vital role of emotions, human communication and manual driving affect drivers' takeover efficiency. Face identity is essential for emotional sensitivity detection for drivers in autonomous vehicles. Automated and intelligent face recognition (FR) devices are highly accurate in a comfortable condition and unregulated, with poor reliability in autonomous vehicles. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly perceive and express feelings in well-being and similar fields. This study suggests an optimized IoT architecture that facilitates the physiological signal with wireless transmission to the database management center. Face Recognition and Emotion Detection based on IoT (FRED-IoT) has been proposed to track drivers' emotional and face recognition in autonomous vehicles. A low delay of 2 milliseconds is achieved in the proposed IoT Protocols. In contrast with cutting-edge technology, FRED-IoT improves reliability and achieves a high rating (F-score) of 96%.}

Purpose
Examine the performance of different stab (Thrust and overhead) and slash (Figure 8 and Reverse) knife motions to determine how long it takes to execute each motion. In addition, examine the variability in executing each motion to inform future self-defense strategies.
Methods
Twenty subjects (Females, n = 4; Males, n = 16; Height: 179.96 ± 8.66 cm; Weight: 94.99 ± 22.37 kg; Age: 36.95 ± 10.63 years) who were all active-duty law enforcement officers (LEOs) with 13.52 ± 11.23 years of LEO experience were recruited to participate in the study. Each subject completed two trials of the knife motions while wearing wearable motion sensors (ADPM) and recorded with a high-speed camera (GoPro) while using a training knife (Cold Steel).
Results
The time to complete the motions were: Thrust, 0.61 ± 0.15 s; Overhead, 0.68 ± 0.14 s; Figure 8, 1.07 ± 0.21 s; and Reverse, 0.62 ± 0.11 s. The Figure 8 motion was significantly slower than the other three motions: F (3, 57) = 101.19, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.84. The reliability analysis reported trivial variability and a high level of agreement: Thrust, ICCα = 0.701, SEM = 0.09 s, CV% = 15.02; Overhead, ICCα = 0.878, SEM = 0.05 s, CV% = 6.93; Figure 8, ICCα = 0.906, SEM = 0.07 s, CV% = 6.25, Reverse, ICCα = 0.420, SEM = 0.10 s, CV% = 17.31.
Discussion
Most LEOs or civilians within striking distance of someone with a knife may not be able to avoid contact from the knife attacks based on the speed knife attacks could occur.
Conclusion
The reference data provides pertinent information to update evidence-based training approaches to knife attack preparation and defense.}

This article presents an integrative design framework for bringing recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the safety of highway workers through real-time multimodal notifications on-spot. To this end, this article conceptualizes and co-designs three major pillars: (1) AR user interface design for multimodal notification, (2) real-time AI at the edge for vehicle detection/classification from distance, and (3) real-time wireless communication in work zone setting to enable latency-aware operation between AI and AR components. Our early results demonstrate that we can achieve 24.83 FPS end-to-end execution latency on the Xavier AGX Jetson board with 48.7% mAP on BDD100K dataset, and a real-time communication covering 120 meters with an average latency of 5.1 ms at the farthest distance. Our mixed-method user research also reveals an acceptable level of excitement and engagement from the body of highway workers toward both the proposed technology and the designed user interface. Overall, this article provides a proof-of-concept toward AI-enabled AR safety systems in highway work zones.}

abstract = {Background
The Styrd Power Meter is gaining special interest for on-field gait analyses due to its low-cost and general availability. However, the reliability and validity of the Stryd during walking on positive slopes using different backpack loads have never been investigated.
Research question
Is the Stryd Power Meter reliable and valid for quantifying gait mechanics during walking on positive inclines and during level walking incorporating load carriage?
Methods
Seventeen participants from a police force rescue team performed 8 submaximal walking trials for 5-min at 3.6 km·h−1 during different positive slope (1%, 10% and 20%) and backpack load (0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of body mass) conditions. Two Stryd devices were utilized for reliability analyses. Validity of cadence and ground contact time (GCT) were analyzed against a gold standard device (Optojump).
Results
The Stryd demonstrated acceptable reliability [mean bias: < 2.5%; effect size (ES): < 0.25; standard error of the mean: < 1.7%; r: > 0.76] for power, cadence, and GCT. Validity measures (mean bias: <0.8%; ES: <0.07; r: >0.96; Lin’s Concordance Coefficient: 0.96; Mean Absolute Percent Error: <1%) for cadence were also found to be acceptable. The Stryd overestimated (P < 0.001; ES: >5.1) GCT in all the walking conditions. A significant systematic positive bias (P < 0.022; r = 0.56–0.76) was found in 7 conditions. Significance: The Stryd Power Meter appears to produce reliable measurements for power output, cadence and GCT. The Stryd produced valid measurements for cadence during walking on positive slopes and during level walking with a loaded backpack. However, the Stryd is not valid for measuring GCT during these walking conditions. This study adds novel data regarding the reliability and validity of this device and might be of particular interest for scientists, practitioners, and first responders seeking reliable devices to quantify gait mechanics during walking.}

ED crowding is a public health crisis, limiting quality and access to lifesaving care. The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the feasibility of radio-frequency identification tags to measure clinician-patient contact and (2) to test the relationship between ED occupancy and clinician-patient contact time.
Methods
In this 4-week observational study, radio-frequency identification tags were worn by emergency clinicians in a 21-bay urban teaching hospital emergency department. The time-motion data were merged with electronic medical repository patient information (N = 3,237) to adjust for occupancy, age, gender, and acuity. Qualitative themes were generated from focus group (N = 39) debriefings of the quantitative results.
Results
Data were collected on 56,342 total clinician events. Adjusting for patient age, increasing ED occupancy increased the number of times the attending physician entered and left the patient room (b = 0 .008, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.001-0.016], P = 0.03). There was no relationship for patient gender, triage acuity, shift at arrival, disposition to home, or discharge diagnosis category with either total minutes or number of encounters per patient visit. No time-motion and occupancy associations were observed for nurses, residents, or nurse practitioners/physician assistants. Debriefings indicated occupancy influenced the quality of care, despite maintaining the same quantity of contact time.
Discussion
The physical environment and clinician privacy concerns limit the feasibility of wearable tracking technology in the emergency setting. Attending physician care becomes more fragmented with increasing ED occupancy. Other clinicians report changes in the quality of care, whereas the quantity of time and encounters were unchanged with occupancy rates.Unlabelled BoxContribution to Emergency Nursing Practice•The current state of scientific knowledge on clinical-patient contact time indicates ED crowding may be detrimental to the quality, quantity, and consistency of care.•The main findings of this research include the following: As occupancy increases, we did not observe differences in time and motion for nurses and nurse practitioners/physician assistants, and we found that attending-physician care becomes more fragmented. There are several physical, architectural barriers to deploying radio-frequency identification tags in the emergency setting. Participating clinicians relayed several qualitative benefits and drawbacks to wearable tracking technology.•Key implications for emergency nursing practice indicate that additional revisions and considerations are needed to enhance wearable tracker feasibility for emergency clinicians.}

Fixed infrastructures, such as cell towers or radio base stations, may be completely destroyed during a disaster or this infrastructure may never have existed. In a disaster situation, having unreliable communications systems can put a relief personnel's safety at risk as well as make the effort much less effective. Furthermore, emergency situations require time-sensitive communications that could mean the difference between life and death. The communications system described in this paper provides a rapidly deployable, data-centric mobile communications system for all organizations engaged in disaster relief: first responders, search-and-rescue, emergency medical and health services, etc. Utilizing the IEEE 802.11b/g standard, this system creates a mobile wireless local area network through a series of “wearable routers”. The routers provide local Wi-Fi access to all users within of their respective ranges, and then all of these routers are connected to each other through an ultra-high-frequency backhaul network. Ultimately, from the user's perspective the network appears to be a standard Wi-Fi network with enhanced range. The purpose of this network is to provide communications between both local and widespread users until more traditional communications systems are restored. A proof-of-concept prototype using commercial-off-the-shelf components has been realized, and the real-world performance of the system has been characterized in Boston, MA and Pittsburgh, PA. The results show that this system provides a viable solution, but requires further attention to antenna design and in-band interference.}

We examined the impact of performing a cognitive task of varying loads and kayaking simultaneously, compared to performance on the same tasks individually.
Background
When two tasks are performed together, performance often suffers compared to performance on either task alone. Interference not only occurs in competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found with certain physically demanding activities, such as climbing.
Method
Skilled kayakers performed a kayak course on open water, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the kayak and counting tasks simultaneously.
Results
Despite some past research finding dual task facilitation with laboratory aerobic activities, simultaneous kayaking and tone counting led to dual-task interference.
Conclusion
Concurrent counting and kayaking led to performance impairments in both tasks, relative to single task performance.
Application
The present results are applicable to occupations involving concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance, such as the work of first responders and military operators.
Précis
Kayaking, like climbing, appears to hinder cognitive performance more than the low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

This retrospective cohort study was a secondary analysis of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epistry-Cardiac Arrest database (December 2005 to June 2015). We included all adult, non-traumatic, non-EMS witnessed, and EMS-treated OHCAs from eleven sites across the US and Canada. We trained a logistic regression model with standard Utstein control variables and interaction terms between EMS response time and the four aforementioned OHCA characteristics.
Results
102,216 patients were included. Three of the four characteristics – witnessed OHCAs (OR = 0.962), bystander CPR (OR = 0.968) and public location (OR = 0.980) – increased the negative effect of a one-minute delay on the odds of survival. In contrast, a bystander AED shock decreased the negative effect of a one-minute response time delay on the odds of survival (OR = 1.064). The magnitude of the effect of a one-minute delay in EMS response time on the odds of survival ranged from 1.3% to 9.8% (average: 5.3%), depending on the underlying OHCA characteristics.
Conclusions
Delays in EMS response time had the largest reduction in survival odds for OHCAs that did not receive a bystander AED shock but were witnessed, occurred in public, and/or received bystander CPR. A bystander AED shock appears to be protective against a delay in EMS response time.}

Most people feel comfortable within a narrow range of temperature (i.e., between 20 °C and 27 °C) and relative humidity (between 35% and 60%). However, extremely hot or cold environments, dynamic climate changes, and excessive body heat and sweat produced from intensive human activities can overwhelm the coping mechanisms of physiological thermoregulation, causing serious heat or cold stress and even fatal conditions. Over the past decade, thermally conductive composites have stimulated remarkable attention to the facilitation of personal thermal management by integrating advanced composite materials and structures for enhanced and programmable warming and cooling effects. In this review, we discuss the developments in personal thermal management using thermally conductive composites, with a focus on mechanistic models and engineering strategies for thermal conduction. We explore the diverse implementations for improving the cooling and warming performance from fibers and yarns to fabrics and the latest wearable technologies. Current challenges and research gaps are summarized, in order to provide a road map for future research opportunities.}

abstract = {Objective
We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance.
Background
Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity.
Method
Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone.
Results
In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate.
Conclusion
Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance.
Application
The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance.
Précis
High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

Recently, the breakthroughs of Industry 4.0 have allowed for tracking worker conditions. Based on these, various analytical models have been performed with the aim of guiding work design in occupational environments, which contributes to ultimately achieving a safe and productive Operator 4.0. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and implementation guidelines. In this paper, we review the literature on upper-limb fatigue modeling in occupational settings, since it is reported shoulder injuries are a pressing issue. From the reviewed papers, our main observations are that the majority of studies focus on identifying human fatigue/reliability indices, and the corresponding factors contributing to these indices, through statistical and biomechanical models. However, existing models lack the consideration of several important aspects of upper-limb fatigue analysis, such as the full use of wearable sensor data in a real-time manner, consideration of the heterogeneity of workers and measurement devices, and the difference between simulated and actual work environment. Moreover, the issue of fatigue development for the workers' upper extremities, which could significantly have an impact on workers' performance, has not yet been studied from a system reliability point of view to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Reliability engineering models that are widely used to model machines can play an important role in modeling humans in occupational settings. We discuss the limitations of the reviewed articles and provide insights for future research.}

One variety of such technology that appears to be on the cusp of a far greater impact on society is that of smart wearables. An important facet of balancing these consequences - both preserving the benefits while recognising and compensating for the challenges - is determining the conditions for the distribution of digital sovereignty that best achieves this balance. This piece offers only a steppingstone toward this wider project by examining the most important moral issues raised by the introduction and use of wearables for individual users, with the aim of arriving at a set of crucial moral considerations that the current designers and purveyors of these technologies have a moral duty to reflect and act upon to ensure the distribution of individual digital sovereignty best able to balance the benefits and challenges. The result of this will be a set of moral calculi that any attempt to distribute digital sovereignty smart wearables will have to consider and address if it is to provide a morally satisfactory distribution.}

To determine long-term survival of patients after cardiac arrest undergoing emergent coronary angiography and therapeutic hypothermia.
Methods
We analysed data from patients treated within the regional STEMI Network from January 2015 to December 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at median follow-up. Secondary endpoints were periprocedural complications (arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, mechanical complication, stent thrombosis, reinfarction, bleeding) and 6-month all-cause death. A landmark analysis was performed, studying two time periods; 0–6 months and beyond 6 months.
Results
From a total of 24,125 patients in the regional STEMI network, 494 patients who suffered from cardiac arrest were included and divided into two groups: treated with (n = 119) and without therapeutic hypothermia (n = 375). At median follow−up (16.0 [0.2–33.3] months), there was no difference in the adjusted mortality rate between groups (51.3 % with hypothermia vs 48.0 % without hypothermia; HRadj1.08 95%CI [0.77–1.53]; p = 0.659). There was a higher frequency of bleeding in the hypothermia group (6.7 % vs 1.1 %; ORadj 7.99 95%CI [2.05–31.2]; p = 0.002), without difference for the rest of periprocedural complications. At 6-month follow−up, adjusted all-cause mortality rate was similar between groups (46.2 % with hypothermia vs 44.5 % without hypothermia; HRadj1.02 95%CI [0.71–1.47]; p = 0.900). Also, no differences were observed in the adjusted mortality rate between 6 months and median follow−up (9.4 % with hypothermia vs 6.3 % without hypothermia; HRadj2.02 95%CI [0.69–5.92]; p = 0.200).
Conclusions
In a large cohort of patients with cardiac arrest within a regional STEMI network, those treated with therapeutic hypothermia did not improve long−term survival compared to those without hypothermia.}

Wearable devices have made it easier to generate and share data collected on individuals. This systematic review seeks to investigate whether deidentifying data from wearable devices is sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals in datasets. We searched Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PubMed, Scopus, and the ACM Digital Library on Dec 6, 2021 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42022312922). We also performed manual searches in journals of interest until April 12, 2022. Although our search strategy had no language restrictions, all retrieved studies were in English. We included studies showing reidentification, identification, or authentication with data from wearable devices. Our search retrieved 17 625 studies, and 72 studies met our inclusion criteria. We designed a custom assessment tool for study quality and risk of bias assessments. 64 studies were classified as high quality and eight as moderate quality, and we did not detect any bias in any of the included studies. Correct identification rates were typically 86–100%, indicating a high risk of reidentification. Additionally, as little as 1–300 s of recording were required to enable reidentification from sensors that are generally not thought to generate identifiable information, such as electrocardiograms. These findings call for concerted efforts to rethink methods for data sharing to promote advances in research innovation while preventing the loss of individual privacy.}

A redox-active solid-gel electrolyte based on fluorescent manganese(II)-doped zinc(II) sulfide was for the first time used to endow the dual functionality to the device when combined with MWCNT-coated textile electrodes. The textile electrodes were prepared through an eco-sustainable straightforward dip-pad-dry process using a natural cotton fabric substrate. The fluorescent hybrid textile supercapacitor exhibited enhanced energy storage performance relative to the EDLC-type analogue containing the undoped electrolyte, namely 20% higher working voltage (1.64 V), 48% higher energy density (1.63 W h kg−1) and 74% higher power density (641.6 W kg−1). Additionally, it presented excellent cycling stability (100%) after 8000 charge/discharge cycles. The device exhibited intense yellow-orange fluorescence under UV light, while preserving the energy storage functionality. This work demonstrated the versatility of this type of devices for dark environment applications, namely in reflective/safety electronic clothing for nighttime users.}

A fatigue risk management standard is being developed and is informed from several sources, including a scoping review of first responder fatigue literature. The objective of this paper is to report on findings from the scoping review to (1) identify measures and tools used by researchers to assess fatigue-related risks, and (2) organize these measures and tools into adapted SOBANE risk management categories to facilitate their selection by organizations and occupational health and safety practitioners. We identified 60 unique measures and tools for the five different dimensions of fatigue across all first response occupations. Several fatigue measurements found in occupational fatigue literature and critical industry fatigue management were not reported; future research should investigate the development of predictive models and the reliability and validity of these tools in first response. The results of this scoping review provide a starting point for organizations to assess fatigue, of any dimension, but the psychometric properties of the identified measures and tools should be considered.}

Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model. In addition, smart city water systems that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at risk of hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water supply. Further research is required to better understand the potential risks associated with smart city technologies and develop new solutions to address them.

For the second objective, a user study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the warning glove is capable of obtaining faster responses and to determine the perceptions of the users regarding the appropriateness of the warning glove. The results confirmed the assumption of faster response times and participants perceived the warning glove to be ‘fairly appropriate’.

abstract = {Background
Novel strategies are required to address rising overdose deaths across the globe. We sought to identify the breadth and depth of the existing evidence around electronic harm reduction (e-harm reduction) interventions that aimed to reduce the harms associated with substance use.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA-ScR and PRISMA for Searching guidelines. A health sciences librarian systematically searched seven health databases from inception until January 20, 2023. Citation chaining and reference lists of included studies were searched to identify additional articles. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted and charted the data. Additionally, we conducted a gray literature search and environmental scan to supplement the findings.
Results
A total of 51 studies met the criteria for inclusion (30 peer-reviewed articles and 21 non-peer reviewed). Most peer-reviewed studies were conducted in Western countries (USA = 23, Canada = 3, Europe = 3, China = 1) and among adult samples (adult = 27, youth/adults =1, unspecified = 2). Study designs were predominantly quantitative (n = 24), with a minority using qualitative (n = 4) or mixed methods (n = 2). Most e-harm reduction interventions were harm reduction (n = 15), followed by education (n = 6), treatment (n = 2), and combined/other approaches (n = 7). Interventions utilized web-based/mobile applications (n = 15), telephone/telehealth (n = 10), and other technology (n = 5).
Conclusions
While e-harm reduction technology is promising, further research is required to establish the efficacy and effectiveness of these novel interventions.}

abstract = {A mask that creates a physical barrier to protect the wearer from breathing in airborne bacteria or viruses, reducing the risk of infection in polluted air and potentially contaminated environments, has become a daily necessity for the public especially as COVID-19 has exploded around the world. However, the use of masks often causes soaring temperatures and thick humid air, leading to thermal and wear discomfort and breathing difficulties for a number of people, and further increasing the elevated risk of heat illnesses including heat stroke and heat exhaustion. When wearers become highly active or work under high tension, the excess sweat generated negatively affects the functionality of masks. Here, we report on an innovative design of an air-conditioned mask (AC Mask) system, facilitating thermoregulation in the mask microclimate, ease of breathing, and wear comfort. The AC Mask system is developed by integrating a cost-effective and lightweight thermoelectric (TE) and ventilation unit in a wearable 3D printed mask device, compatible with existing disposable masks, to protect end users safely against toxic particles such as viruses. A wind-guided tunnel has been developed for quick and efficient ventilation of cooling air. Based on a human trial, reductions in the apparent microclimate temperature and the humidity by 3.5 °C and 50%, respectively, have been achieved under a low voltage. With the excellent thermal management properties, the AC Mask will find also wide application among professional end-users such as construction workers, firefighters, and medical personnel.}

Traditional methods available till date for detection of material i.e. those important for forensic investigation are time consuming, costly as well as the require expertise handling. Nano based biosensors can assist with high-throughput, large-scale and sensitive screening of the samples or specimens to find target compounds at very low concentration with high evidential value in forensic evidence. Without the requirement for extra laboratory instrumentation or equipment or time-consuming preparatory procedures, nanomaterial based biosensors offer sensitive and reasonably priced examination of materials. Therefore, in this review article emphasis has been given on development of nanomaterial based biosensors, as well as the most recent developments in the forensic examination of a wide range of chemicals, including alcohol, narcotic drugs, and explosives has been discussed. In nutshell, nano-material based biosensors can offer a reliable means for finding forensically relevant evidence as they will also reduce analysis times, turn large instruments into compact chip-based platforms, and make investigations more timely, sensitive, and applicable leading to dismissal of the criminal case early. Overall, biosensors and in particular nanobiosensors offer a promising solution for many challenges faced by society today. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of nanobiosensors in the future.}

We also compared these results to previous studies employing the tone counting tasks with physically demanding tasks (climbing, kayaking and running). The interference between tone counting and mathematical calculations was worse than the interference between tone counting and running and kayaking.

Hence, this industrial transformation may contribute to assists human beings in the workplace with a focus on mental health. This article presents a systematic literature review to investigate studies regarding technologies employed in the care of worker's mental health and the industrial role in this scenario. Three general, three focused, and three descriptive questions highlight the academic progress of industrial concern on mental health, implemented systems and cases, and research challenges. As a result, the review discussed 31 studies, extracted from an initial corpus of 25269, ranging from January 2010 to November 2020. The studies approached stress as the most frequent mental issue in the industry and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the most used machine learning algorithm, where biomarkers presented the primary data extractors to deal with this theme. Moreover, information fusion methods improved the accuracy of specific cases. However, a growing interest in mental health care has emerged only in recent years, and several challenges require efforts before applying systems in real industrial environments.}

Substantial individual variability in physiological tolerance to thermal stress necessitates an individualized approach to mitigate the deleterious effects of thermal stress, such as physiological monitoring of individual thermal strain. During heat exposure, measurements of deep-body (Tc) and skin temperatures and heart rate can provide some indication of thermal strain. Combining these physiological variables with biomechanical markers of gait (in)stability may provide further insight on central nervous system dysfunction – the key criterion of exertional heat stroke (EHS). Thermal strain in cold environments can be monitored with skin temperature (peripheral and proximal), shivering thermogenesis and Tc. Non-invasive methods for real-time estimation of Tc have been developed and some appear to be promising but require further validation. Decision-support tools provide useful information for planning activities and biomarkers can be used to improve their predictions, thus maximizing safety and performance during hot- and cold-weather operations. With better understanding on the etiology and pathophysiology of EHS, the microbiome and markers of the inflammatory responses have been identified as novel biomarkers of heat intolerance. This review aims to (i) discuss selected physiological and biomechanical markers of heat or cold strain, (ii) how biomarkers may be used to ensure operational readiness in hot and cold environments, and (iii) present novel molecular biomarkers (e.g., microbiome, inflammatory cytokines) for preventing EHS.}

abstract = {Objective
To better understand how older adults currently manage emergency information, the barriers and facilitators to planning and management of emergency information, as well as the potential role of information technology to facilitate emergency planning and management.
Introduction
Older adults face a much higher risk of sudden illness/injury and are the age group with the largest percentages of emergent and urgent healthcare visits. Emergency information (health information needed in an emergency situation such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives) needs to be maintained and easily accessible to ensure older adults get appropriate care and treatment consistent with their wishes in emergency situations. Current health information technologies rarely take into consideration the emergency information needs of older adults, their caregivers, and emergency responders.
Methods
As part of a larger study we performed in-depth interviews with 90 older adults living in a variety of residential settings (independent living, retirement communities, assisted living) regarding how they manage information about their health. Interview sessions included photos of important health information artifacts. Interviews were transcribed and coded.
Results
Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that emergency information is a type of health information that older adults frequently manage. Participants differed in whether they practice emergency planning (e.g. the preparation and continued management of emergency information), and in whether they involve others in emergency information and emergency planning. Despite its importance, emergency information was often not up-to-date and not always kept in locations readily apparent to emergency responders.
Conclusion
Emergency information, such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives, is a type of health information that older adults manage. Considering emergency information in the design of health information technologies for older adults could address some of the barriers and support the facilitators to emergency planning and information management.}

The algorithm and device have been tested in two controlled fire behaviour training environments in both the UK and US during multiple flashovers, demonstrating the integrity of the predictions and subsequent alarm triggering in this environment, specifically, triggering an alarm 27 s ahead of flashover for a unit positioned at firefighter crouching height (0.8 m). These experiments included testing on a reference mannequin to explore the potential impact of the boundary effect on temperature measurements close to a tunic, as well as the impact of simulated firefighter movement on the output predictions and therefore alarm states. The results from subsequent testing of the devices in realistic firefighting conditions by firefighter instructors demonstrate the dynamic response of the algorithm to changing conditions equivalent to a serious domestic building fire, including the potential benefit of the precautionary ‘pre-alarm’. Finally, a snapshot of results from extended trials in an uncontrolled training environment with multiple firefighters is discussed, including early developments towards a potential concept of use including cloud-based aggregation of individual firefighter temperature exposure data.}

abstract = {Background
Cardiac arrests are often categorized into two separate groups depending on the location of the arrest: in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Despite this distinction, few studies have compared the two groups directly. The aim of this study was to compare patient characteristics, cardiac arrest characteristics, and outcomes for IHCA and OHCA patients.
Methods
Data on IHCA and OHCA in Denmark were obtained from two nationwide, prospective registries. All adult (≥18 years old) patients with index IHCA or OHCA from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 were included. Supplementary information on outcomes, hospitalizations, and chronic diseases came from additional national registries. The primary outcome was 30-day survival and secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 1-year survival.
Results
The study included 3501 patients with IHCA and 8846 patients with OHCA. The two groups were similar in demographics, most comorbidities, and initial cardiac arrest rhythm. In the unadjusted analysis, IHCA was associated with increased survival to 30 days compared to OHCA (risk ratio [RR] = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.30; 1.54) and 1 year (RR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.33; 1.61). Adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities did not change the RR substantially. When cardiac arrest characteristics were added to the model, the RR decreased from 1.51 (95% CI, 1.39; 1.65) to 1.06 (95% CI, 0.93; 1.20) for survival to 30 days and from 1.66 (95% CI, 1.50; 1.84) to 1.09 (95% CI, 0.94; 1.26) for survival to 1 year. In all subgroup analyses based on cardiac arrest characteristics (e.g. witnessed status), the association between location and outcome was substantially mitigated compared to the primary analyses.
Conclusions
In this large, national study, we found that IHCA and OHCA patients were remarkably similar in demographics and most comorbidities. IHCA patients had better outcomes compared to OHCA patients, although these differences disappeared when comparing patients with similar cardiac arrest characteristics.}

Researchers and medical practitioners need safe and cheaper means of performing their research, ensuring public safety, and delivering customised health options to patients. One such solution can be easily carried out by using biosensors. In the new medical field, biomedical studies of diagnosis are of growing significance. Biosensors' applications are for screening infectious to early detection, chronic disease treatment, health management, and well-being surveillance. Improved biosensors technology qualities allow the ability to detect disease and track the body's response to care. Sensor technology is integral to numerous, low-cost, and improved-form factors feasible in modern medical devices. Biosensors have good potential, as it is easy, scalable and effective in manufacturing processes. This paper discusses biosensors and their significant benefits in the medical field. Distinctive capabilities of biosensors in healthcare services and for cardiovascular disease are provided and shown diagrammatically. The paper also discusses various diagnostic biosensors for cardiovascular diseases and provides novel aspects of biosensors for clinical and allied services. Thereby paper provides significant advancements in biosensors in the medical field. Finally, fourteen major applications of biosensors in the medical field are identified and discussed. Biosensors' intelligent wearable properties now allow older people to control their health with lesser interference, and it directly exchanges their medical-related information with healthcare providers, thereby reducing hospital visits. Thus, biosensors have countless prospects for consumer and commercial uses in wellness, fitness, athletics, etc. Linked biomedical devices, apps, firmware, and sophisticated algorithms will do a lot, including allowing major new medical therapies and informing users about health reform, providing solutions and advice informed by real-time evidence.}

This manuscript aims to describe the translational science (TS) methodology adopted to guide the development of the NIGHTINGALE toolkit. The multi-stage process featured three different scoping reviews, three Modified Delphi studies and subsequent translation of consensus statements into evidence-based tools and guidelines on triage, prehospital life support and damage control interventions, and prehospital processes during SODs and MCIs.

A systematic literature search was conducted leading to results categorized in four groups including: productivity, physical discomfort, interface usability, and driving distraction. Although MCT use has increased officer productivity, several usability issues need to be resolved. The MCT has also increased officer physical discomfort and distraction. MCT design and implementation guidelines that resolve human factors issues in police patrols were identified along with an enhanced design concept. Guidelines for MCT design were validated with an online survey completed by 81 police officers. Future research directions were proposed to recognize police officer needs and work context.}

abstract = {Aim
Cardiac arrest (CA) is the cessation of circulation to vital organs that can only be reversed with rapid and appropriate interventions. Sensor technologies for early detection and activation of the emergency medical system could enable rapid response to CA and increase the probability of survival. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the literature surrounding the performance of sensor technologies in detecting OHCA.
Methods
We searched the academic and grey literature using keywords related to cardiac arrest, sensor technologies, and recognition/detection. We included English articles published up until June 6, 2022, including investigations and patent filings that reported the sensitivity and specificity of sensor technologies to detect cardiac arrest on human or animal subjects. (Prospero# CRD42021267797).
Results
We screened 1666 articles and included four publications examining sensor technologies. One tested the performance of a physical sensor on human participants in simulated CA, one tested performance on audio recordings of patients in cardiac arrest, and two utilized a hybrid design for testing including human participants and ECG databases. Three of the devices were wearable and one was an audio detection algorithm utilizing household smart technologies. Real-world testing was limited in all studies. Sensitivity and specificity for the sensors ranged from 97.2 to 100% and 90.3 to 99.9%, respectively. All included studies had a medium/high risk of bias, with 2/4 having a high risk of bias.
Conclusions
Sensor technologies show promise for cardiac arrest detection. However, current evidence is sparse and of high risk of bias. Small sample sizes and databases with low external validity limit the generalizability of findings.}

The substantial research and the increase in technology readiness levels (TRLs) of graphene-based technologies have led to the adoption of graphene in many industries. Graphene-based wearables are one such technology that involves closer interaction of graphene by the end-user. Despite this, understanding the toxicological risks associated with using graphene-based wearables is still in the fundamental stage. Herein, graphene-based wearables and industrial-scale fabrication techniques for the development of graphene-based wearables are reviewed. The main goal of the review is to initially evaluate the likelihood of user exposure to graphene from the wearable device and the potential health effects. The subsequent health risks based on graphene's physicochemical characteristics are also discussed. A framework to elucidate the risk is presented in terms of crucial exposure routes, possible graphene interactions, recent exposure assessments, detection removal techniques from the human body, and risk management protocols. It is hoped that this review may aid towards establishing a reasonable practice concerning the safe integration of graphene materials into wearables and facilitate their commercialization.}

Disease-related treatment action plans for acute exacerbations providing information that may be helpful for self-management for patients and caregivers are commonly used for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes. However, among patients with epilepsy, a review of the literature suggested that the majority did not have an action plan in place for acute seizure treatment.
Recent findings
Currently, there is a lack of unified guidance on seizure action plans (SAPs) in the literature. In the authors’ opinion, available formats have limitations for practical use and may not be easily customizable to individual patients, and they are not often designed to provide simple-to-follow steps for rapid immediate steps to determine and initiate appropriate treatment of seizure emergencies. Our group reviewed current examples of SAPs and provided guidance on the development of acute seizure action plans (ASAPs) designed to facilitate rapid, appropriate acute care in the community and to be as useful as possible for a wide range of care partners, including those with limited experience.
Summary
This paper provides agreed upon expert opinion recommendations and considerations for goals, development process, types of content, and format for an ASAP.}

While the article discusses these innovations from a nursing perspective, the issues raised can apply to any healthcare discipline. Accordingly, it is essential for regulatory bodies to explore how these potentially disruptive innovations will be regulated. Finding regulatory solutions is necessary if today’s industrial-era regulatory model is to evolve into one fit for a rapidly-changing, complex digital environment where healthcare delivery is increasingly dependent on new technologies. Having considered the wider literature on how regulators address disruptive innovation, we conclude the nursing profession, and regulated professions in general, can learn from these experiences.

abstract = {Background
The relatively decreased time spent in the operating room and overall reduction in cases performed by neurosurgical trainees as a result of duty-hour restrictions demands that the pedagogical content within each surgical encounter be maximized and crafted toward the specific talents and shortcomings of the individual. It is imperative to future generations that the quality of training adapts to the changing administrative infrastructures and compensates for anything that may compromise the technical abilities of trainees. Neurosurgeons in teaching hospitals continue to experiment with various emerging technologies—such as simulators and virtual presence—to supplement and improve surgical training.
Methods
The authors participated in the Google Glass Explorer Program in order to assess the applicability of Google Glass as a tool to enhance the operative education of neurosurgical residents. Google Glass is a type of wearable technology in the form of eyeglasses that employs a high-definition camera and allows the user to interact using voice commands.
Results
Google Glass was able to effectively capture video segments of various lengths for residents to review in a variety of clinical settings within a large, tertiary care university hospital, as well as during a surgical mission to a developing country. The resolution and quality of the video were adequate to review and use as a teaching tool.
Conclusion
While Google Glass harbors the potential to dramatically improve both neurosurgical education and practice in a variety of ways, certain technical drawbacks of the current model limit its effectiveness as a teaching tool.}

Narrative review
Results
Delayed activation of EMS for stroke symptoms by patients and witnesses deprives patients of rapid access to brain-saving therapies and occurs due to public unawareness of stroke features, cognitive and motor deficits produced by the stroke itself, and sleep onset. A promising emerging approach to overcoming the inherent biologic constraints of patient capacity to self-detect and respond to stroke symptoms is continuous monitoring by mobile health technologies with wireless sensors and artificial intelligence recognition systems. This review surveys 11 sensing technologies - accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors, touch screen and keyboard input detectors, artificial vision, and artificial hearing; and 10 consumer device form factors in which they are increasingly implemented: smartphones, smart speakers, smart watches and fitness bands, smart speakers/voice assistants, home health robots, smart clothing, smart beds, closed circuit television, smart rings, and desktop/laptop/tablet computers.
Conclusions
The increase in computing power, wearable sensors, and mobile connectivity have ushered in an array of mobile health technologies that can transform stroke detection and EMS activation. By continuously monitoring a diverse range of biometric parameters, commercially available devices provide the technologic capability to detect cardinal language, motor, gait, and sensory signs of stroke onset. Intensified translational research to convert the promise of these technologies to validated, accurate real-world deployments are an important next priority for stroke investigation.}

Until now, most of the systems do not go beyond using facial and fingerprint data to start the engine or access the car; however, new generations demand more personalization plus the vehicle making decisions based on their physiological characteristics. Although this kind of technology is considered a luxury feature in general, actually it could help users and save their lives. Indeed, biometry is the way to make the human-vehicle relationship happen, whether the biometric devices are embedded inside the vehicle, used as an accessory or wearables. By using as input not only the sensors inside the vehicle but also data from outside, the vehicle could adapt and/or learn new information to make the best possible decision.}

This study provides a simple and effective strategy to improve the flame retardancy of textiles through a synergistic effect between the blended fibers, and a system with synergistic in flame retardant vinylon (FRV)/poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) blended fibers is discovered. The FRV/PMIA 50/50 exhibits a much higher time to ignition and a lower peak heat release rate than those of the neat components, indicating a synergistic flame retardancy between constituents. The corresponding mechanism is explored. The residual char layer formed by blended fibers connects together and keeps the original fiber shape, which acts as a barrier slowing heat transmission and gas diffusion. Concurrently, thermal degradation analysis of blended fibers implies that both components mutually interact with each other, resulting in a higher experimental amount of incombustible gases at an early degradation stage and lower experimental amount of combustible gases at a later degradation stage as compared to the theoretical one. Therefore, the synergistic flame retardancy in FRV/PMIA blended fibers is attributed to the actions in the condensed and gas phases during pyrolysis. This work provides an effective strategy to design fireproof textiles.}

Flexible temperature sensors offer conformal attachment with the human skin for stable and continuous measurements and have therefore garnered extensive attention in recent years. However, although significant achievement has been made in terms of enhancing sensitivity or gaining stability under deformation, they are still limited by low accuracy under large mechanical strain, slow response in dynamic environments, increasing hysteresis and limited measurement range. In addition, large and continuous mapping in flexible formats is required to accurately realize temporal and spatial variation of physiological temperature before such devices can be practically applied for continuous health monitoring or in electronic skin measurements. This review comprehensively presents significant advances in flexible temperature sensors based on nanocomposite materials categorizing the work according to materials, sensor design, sensing mechanisms and compatible fabrication strategies.

This study builds on a national report and a qualitative study, completed in the United States, which explored librarians' attitudes on privacy. Adding a Canadian voice to the literature, this study examines survey results from academic librarians in Canada on their perceptions and attitudes related to library practices and online privacy behaviors. Overall, Canadian academic librarians believe that protecting patron privacy and educating patrons about issues related to online privacy is important. However, many Canadian academic librarians doubt that libraries are doing all they can to protect patron privacy. Academic librarians stand to gain knowledge and understanding of peer attitudes toward online privacy, as well as how patron privacy is being advocated for and protected on university campuses across Canada. The results will guide future library policies and programming aimed at creating an environment where privacy rights are protected and patrons can make informed choices about their online actions.}

Traditional firearms use gunpowder, which limits the gun's use to a single function and quickly depletes the ammo supply. The coil gun, which uses electrical energy harvested from a Bio-thermal energy harvester, allows multifunctional bullets to be used in a rifle during an emergency without exploding. As coil cannon projectiles, deflected bullets or bullet shells from the battlefield can be used if necessary. This means that energy collecting and conversion for autonomous and flexible wearable technologies, as well as other applications like Internet of Things (IoTs), military, industrial, consumer and non-consumer domains, will become an extensively explored topic. Nowadays, energy independence is a hot concern thanks to flexible gadgets' rising popularity. Thermoelectric energy harvesting, a potential new method to gather easily accessible body heat, is particularly well-suited to the wearing of sensors and electronics. A coil gun battery can be charged using a thermoelectric generator (TEG), which can harness energy from the human body. The thermoelectric generator and charger can both be found in a single patch that can be worn. The TEG ANSYS model is used in this research project. Human body heat can be used to power highly specialized applications like medical ones since it is reliable and natural. The average human body produces roughly 100 W of heat while at rest, and about 525 W of heat while exercising.}

abstract = {Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is one of the largest causes of mortality globally, with an out-of-hospital survival below 10% despite intense research. This document outlines challenges in addressing the epidemic of SCA, along the framework of respond, understand and predict, and prevent. Response could be improved by technology-assisted orchestration of community responder systems, access to automated external defibrillators, and innovations to match resuscitation resources to victims in place and time. Efforts to understand and predict SCA may be enhanced by refining taxonomy along phenotypical and pathophysiological “axes of risk,” extending beyond cardiovascular pathology to identify less heterogeneous cohorts, facilitated by open-data platforms and analytics including machine learning to integrate discoveries across disciplines. Prevention of SCA must integrate these concepts, recognizing that all members of society are stakeholders. Ultimately, solutions to the public health challenge of SCA will require greater awareness, societal debate and focused public policy.}

abstract = {Exposure to extreme temperatures in workplaces implies serious physical hazards to workers. In addition, a poorly acclimatized worker can have reduced performance and alertness. It may therefore be more vulnerable to the risk of accidents and injuries. Due to the incompatibility of standards and regulations with some work environments and a lack of thermal exchange in many personal protective equipment, heat stress remains among the most common physical risks in many industrial sectors. Furthermore, conventional methods of measuring physiological parameters in order to calculate personal thermophysiological constraints are not practical to use during work tasks. However, the emergence of wearable technologies can contribute to real-time measurement of body temperature and the biometric signals needed to assess thermophysiological constraints while actively working. Thus, the present study was carried out in order to scrutinize the current knowledge of these types of technologies by analyzing the available systems and the advances made in previous studies, as well as to discuss the efforts required to develop devices for the prevention of the occurrence of heat stress in real time.}

Compared to other professions, firefighters are at high risk for musculoskeletal injuries, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to systemically review the effects of sleep on firefighter occupational performance and health. A search was conducted for studies that conducted a quantitative analysis involving sleep and occupational performance in firefighters. Relevant data were extracted and study quality evaluated with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. There were 15 articles meeting the inclusion criteria with a total sample of 1591 (1539 male, 52 female) firefighters. We found that firefighters with poor sleep measures had worse cognitive performance and overall health, but physical capabilities were not impacted by acute sleep restriction. However, chronic poor sleep would likely negatively impact physical performance due to being associated with a decline in numerous health measures. To avoid sleep-related declines in occupational performance fire departments should consider the consequences of shift schedules on the performance and health of firefighters. Furthermore, sleep education interventions, the use of wearables to monitor, recovery and sleep health screening appear beneficial based on prior research.}

This is because of their exceptional mechanical and structural characteristics, metal electrical conductivity, and other outstanding physical and chemical properties. In this contribution, we review recent cellulose research advances and show that MXene hybrids are effective composites that benefit from cellulose superior water dispersibility and the electrostatic attraction between cellulose and MXene to prevent MXene accumulation and improve the composite's mechanical properties. Electrical, materials, chemical, mechanical, environmental, and biomedical engineering are all fields in which cellulose/MXene composites are used. These properties and applications-based reviews on MXene/cellulose composite, critically analyze the results and accomplishments in these fields and provide context for potential future research initiatives.

abstract = {Commotio cordis is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by sudden cardiac arrest resulting from a blunt chest impact. While commotio cordis has traditionally been associated with sports-related activities, a significant proportion of cases occur in non-sport-related settings, such as assaults, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), and daily activities. This critical review examines the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, highlighting the need for increased awareness and improved management in these contexts. The review analyzes existing literature, drawing attention to the demographics of non-sports-related cases, which predominantly affect adolescents and young adults, with males being the primary demographic. In contrast to sport-related cases, non-sports-related commotio cordis cases exhibit a wider age range and a higher proportion of female subjects. Mortality rates are significantly higher in non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, largely due to lower rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), limited access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), and delayed initiation of resuscitative efforts compared to sport-related incidents. This underscores the critical importance of increasing awareness and preparedness in non-sport-related settings. To mitigate the risks associated with non-sports-related commotio cordis, efforts should focus on early recognition of the condition, timely administration of CPR, and the widespread availability and accessibility of AEDs in various environments. Enhanced awareness and education can potentially lead to a reduction in mortality and improved outcomes for individuals affected by commotio cordis outside of sports-related activities. In conclusion, commotio cordis is not exclusive to sports and presents a significant health risk in non-sport-related scenarios. This review emphasizes the urgent need for increased awareness, preparedness, and resuscitation measures in non-sports contexts to address the higher mortality associated with these cases.}

abstract = {Aim of the review
Use of smart devices to provide real-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) feedback in the context of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has considerable potential for improving survival. However, the findings of previous studies evaluating the effectiveness of these devices have been conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the utility of smart devices for improving the quality of CPR during CPR training.
Data sources
Thirteen electronic databases were searched. The articles were reviewed according to the eligibility criteria. CPR quality was evaluated based on the rates and depths of chest compression, and the proportion of adequate depth of chest compressions.
Results
Ultimately, 11 studies (5 randomised controlled trials, 1 randomised trial, and 5 randomised cross-over trials) were selected for this systematic review. Eight of these studies used smartphones and three used smartwatches. This review did not find an apparent benefit from smart device use during CPR in terms of maintaining the recommended compression rates and depths of chest compressions. However, all three smartwatch studies reported that the proportion of chest compressions of adequate depth was significantly improved with smartwatch use (smartwatch group vs. non-smartwatch group in the three studies: 65.01% vs. 45.15%, p = 0.01; 64.6% vs. 43.1%, p = 0.049; 98.7% vs. 79.3%, p = 0.002).
Conclusion
This review does not find durable evidence for usefulness of smart devices in CPR training. However, the smartwatches may improve the accuracy of chest compression depth. Future studies with larger sample sizes might be necessary before reaching a firm conclusion.}

The use of a Health Monitoring System could aid the cabin crew in early detecting critical health conditions. Additionally, for passengers there is no possibility to discreetly inform the crew about emergencies since there is only a Passenger Call Button available. Research Question This paper analyses passengers´ user acceptance of the Health Monitoring System as well as the Emergency Button. Method Participants needed to complete an online survey and were presented prototypes of the Health Monitoring System as well as the Emergency Button. User acceptance was measured using the Van der Laan scale. A total of 41 participants contributed to the study. Result The user ratings for the Onboard Health Monitoring System were low mainly due to privacy concerns of the passengers. Since only one use case for the Emergency Button has been presented to the participants of the study, the user acceptance ratings were also low. Discussion Passengers were reluctant to share sensitive data. However, the majority (over 70%, n≥ 11, effective sample size=16)) agreed to have the most important vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, oxygen saturation measured. Conclusion To increase user acceptance of the Health Monitoring System it is important for the passengers to ensure that sensitive data is handled and stored carefully. Additional detailed usability assessments would be necessary for both devices to draw further conclusions about system design.}

Conceptual advances in the study of tourist videography have produced a new model of these practices which is applied here to explain the nature of tourist videography with drones. An international sample of 351 vacation drone videos was subjected to content analysis, and an analysis of their metadata. The results show a significant variation in the content, technological and social practice of production of vacation drone videos depending on the type of video creator and, therefore, empirically validate and expand extant knowledge of drone videography as an emerging visual practice in tourism contexts. The findings establish that analysing the videos from the perspective of videography generates insights that are of value to destination management organizations and tourist businesses. We conclude that destination management organizations should see vacation drone videos as a new type of user-generated content for their destinations, as well as a potential source of innovative marketing ideas, and that they should engage more proactively with vacation drone videographers to maximise the impact of this opportunity.}

With an average of more than 6.5 devices per person, a plethora of applications are being developed especially related to healthcare. Although, current edge devices such as smartphone and smartwatch are becoming increasingly more powerful and more affordable, there are certain tasks such as those involving machine learning that require higher computational resources, thereby resulting in higher energy consumption in the case of edge devices. Offloading tasks to co-located edge nodes such as fog (a cloud-like localized, smaller resource pool), or a femto-cloud (integration of multiple edge nodes) is one viable solution to address the issues such as performing compute-intensive tasks, and managing energy consumption. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and becoming a pandemic has also made a case for edge computing (involving smartphone, wearables, health sensors) for the detection of symptoms to quarantine potential carriers of the virus. We focus on how various forms of smart and opportunistic healthcare (oHealth) can be provided by leveraging edge computing that makes use of a machine learning-based approach. We apply k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector classification (SVC) algorithms on real data trace for the healthcare and safety-related scenarios we considered. The empirical results obtained provide useful insights into machine learning-based task offloading in edge computing.}

This recognition aims to provide the right assistance at the right moment and gives some autonomy to seniors. However, it is a complex task (a significant quantity of different sensors, hardware implementation), and the number of solutions (combinations between approaches, for example, video-based HAR and wearable sensors-based HAR) that exist is important. In this paper, we propose to perform the activity recognition from three ultra-wideband (UWB) radars, deep learning models, and a voting system. Also, all the experiments have been conducted in a real apartment and are composed of 15 different activities. The presented solution is simple compared to the literature since we exploit only one type of sensor. Finally, we obtained promising results with our approach. Indeed, the classification rate reaches 90% and more in some cases.}

This knowledge can reflect individuals’ future health, which leads to their information advantage. People with information advantages can hide their true private information and obtain insurance, which leads to service inefficiency for insurance providers. To reduce this inefficiency, we design a mechanism for the health system to build a set of multi-strategy combination insurance plans for heterogeneous probabilistic individuals, where the prices and the price difference of plans guide their choice and prevention strategy. First, after analysing the utility of the individuals and the health system when the individuals use true/false information, we propose a reasonable goal of this mechanism: When the people use true information to make decisions, the individuals and the health system can obtain maximum utility. Second, we provide the conditions for the individuals and the health system to participate in health insurance, and the conditions for achieving the rationality goal of the mechanism. Finally, we obtain the optimal result for the individuals and the health system. On one hand, some new theories on mechanism design are produced in health insurance transactions. On the other hand, the insurance scheme design effectively eliminates the individual’s motive for concealing information and improves the efficiency of health services.}

abstract = {Information sharing and consumption play an important role during a pandemic in managing constrained resources and devising effective plans to minimize a pandemic’s impact. The type of support extended by information also changes as a pandemic evolves. In this paper, we present a novel framework to understand the different types of information support needed during a pandemic crisis. Adapting phases from the pandemic crisis management lifecycle, we propose five different overlapping phases of our proposed Pandemic Information Support Lifecycle (PISL): awareness information support, preventive care information support, active information support, confidence-building information support and evaluation information support. To validate the proposed PISL, we examine the evolution of new mobile apps during the current COVID-19 pandemic by developing a taxonomy for mobile app-based information support. The proposed lifecycle presents future phases of information support for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while identifying specific areas that need additional research and mobile-based information support development.}

With the increase in the uptake of Internet-of-Things home devices, it becomes critical to understand the digital harms of smart homes. We present a systematic literature review on the security and privacy harms of smart homes. PRISMA methodology is used to systematically review 63 studies published between January 2011 and October 2021; and a review of known cases is undertaken to illustrate the literature review findings with real-world scenarios. Published literature identifies that smart homes may pose threats to confidentiality (unwanted release of information), authentication (sensing information being falsified) and unauthorised access to system controls. Most existing studies focus on privacy intrusions as a prevalent form of harm against smart homes. Other types of harms that are less common in the literature include hacking, malware and DoS attacks. Digital harms, and data associated with these harms, may vary extensively across smart devices. Most studies propose technical measures to mitigate digital harms, while fewer consider social prevention mechanisms. We also identify salient gaps in research, and argue that these should be addressed in future crossdisciplinary research initiatives.}

abstract = {Introduction
We developed and validated an abbreviated Digital Sleep Questionnaire (DSQ) to identify common societal sleep disturbances including insomnia, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS), and risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
Methods
The DSQ was administered to 3799 community volunteers, of which 2113 were eligible and consented to the study. Of those, 247 were interviewed by expert sleep physicians, who diagnosed ≤2 sleep disorders. Machine Learning (ML) trained and validated separate models for each diagnosis. Regularized linear models generated 15–200 features to optimize diagnostic prediction. Models were trained with five-fold cross-validation (repeated five times), followed by robust validation testing. ElasticNet models were used to classify true positives and negatives; bootstrapping optimized probability thresholds to generate sensitivities, specificities, accuracies, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).
Results
Compared to reference subgroups, physician-diagnosed sleep disorders were marked by DSQ evidence of sleeplessness (insomnia, DSPS, OSA), sleep debt (DSPS, ISS), airway obstruction during sleep (OSA), blunted circadian variability in alertness (DSPS), sleepiness (DSPS and ISS), increased alertness (insomnia) and global impairment in sleep-related quality of life (all sleep disorders). ElasticNet models validated each diagnosis with high sensitivity (80–83%), acceptable specificity (63–69%), high AUC (0.80–0.85) and good accuracy (agreement with physician diagnoses, 68–73%).
Discussion
A brief DSQ readily engaged and efficiently screened a large population for common sleep disorders. Powered by ML, the DSQ can accurately classify sleep disturbances, demonstrating the potential for improving the sleep, health, productivity and safety of populations.}

The performance of the printed graphene e-textile wearable systems were benchmarked against the “gold standard” silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) “wet” electrodes; achieving excellent correlation up to ∼ 96% and ∼ 98% in ECG recordings (15 s duration) acquired with graphene textiles fabricated by dip-coating and spray printing techniques, respectively. In addition, we successfully implemented automatic detection of heartrate of 8 volunteers (mean value: 74.4 bpm) during 5 min of static and dynamic daily activities and benchmarked their recordings with a standard fingertip photoplethysmography (PPG) device. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated, and the root means successive square difference (rMMSD) metric was 30 ms during 5 min of recording. Other cardiac parameters such as R-R interval, QRS complex duration, S-T segment duration, and T-wave duration were also detected and compared to typical chest ECG values.}

Our goals are to (1) evaluate input modalities for the drones, derived from an iterative narrowing of the design space, (2) improve our mixed reality system for designing input modalities and training operators, and (3) collect data on how participants socially experience the virtual drones with which they work. In our study, 17 participants played the game with two input modalities (Gesture condition, Tap condition) in counterbalanced order. Results indicated that participants performed best with the Gesture condition. Participants found the multiple controls challenging, and future studies might include more training of the devices and game. Participants felt like a team with the drones and found them moderately agentic. In our future work, we will extend this testing to a more externally valid mixed reality game.}

Despite substantial research worldwide, very few AI-based applications have successfully made it to clinics. Key barriers to the widespread adoption of clinically validated AI applications include non-standardized medical records, limited availability of curated datasets, and stringent legal/ethical requirements to preserve patients’ privacy. Therefore, there is a pressing need to improvise new data-sharing methods in the age of AI that preserve patient privacy while developing AI-based healthcare applications. In the literature, significant attention has been devoted to developing privacy-preserving techniques and overcoming the issues hampering AI adoption in an actual clinical environment. To this end, this study summarizes the state-of-the-art approaches for preserving privacy in AI-based healthcare applications. Prominent privacy-preserving techniques such as Federated Learning and Hybrid Techniques are elaborated along with potential privacy attacks, security challenges, and future directions.}

abstract = {During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (also known as COVID-19), workforce downsizing needs, safety requirements, supply chain breaks and inventory shortages affected manufacturing systems’ and supply chain’s responsiveness and resilience. Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

All the PV devices are characterised under AM 1.5 (100mW/cm2) irradiation using an ABET solar simulator. Device morphologies are examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The aim of this study is to develop and optimise a method to obtain reproducible photovoltaic textiles using a fully spray coating processing at low temperature (<150 °C) on a standard 65/35 polyester cotton fabric. The main challenge when spray coating solar cells of less than a few micron thickness is the surface roughness of the polyester cotton fabric which is of the order of 150 µm. We report a maximum optimised efficiency of 2.7% achieved on a glass substrate and 0.02% on woven fabrics, respectively. This approach is suitable for the low cost integration of PV devices into clothing and other decorative textiles.}

Then, the definition of flexibility and flexibility mechanisms of MNFs, as well as the strategies and methods for fabricating flexible oxide ceramic MNFs are comprehensively discussed. Finally, our perspective on the future development of oxide ceramic MNFs is proposed. We suppose that they will develop toward the direction of flexibility, porosity, multifunctionality, thin film, and aerogels, and their functional applications will permeate from the traditional heat insulation to the emerging fields such as flexible electronics and batteries, intelligent artificial muscle, and industrial catalysis.}

The thermal transfer between individual body and the surroundings occurs by several paths such as radiation, evaporation, conduction, and convection. Thermal management is related with the heat transfer between the human body and the surroundings, which aims to keep the body temperature in the comfort range either via preserving or via emitting the body heat. The essential duty of clothing is to contribute to the thermal balance of the human body by regulating the heat and moisture transfer. In the case of poorly controlled body heat, health problems such as hyperthermia and heatstroke along with environmental problems due to higher energy consumption can occur. Recently, research has been focused on advanced textiles with novel approaches on materials synthesis and structure design, which can provide thermal comfort together with energy saving. This review article focuses on the innovative strategies basically on the passive textile models for improved thermal conductivity. We will discuss both the fabrication techniques and the inclusion of carbon-based and boron-based fillers to form nano-hybrid textile solutions, which are used to improve the thermal conductivity of the materials.}

abstract = {Prior to widespread sensor deployments being used to create networks for applications like fuel-based home appliances, industrial emissions, and vehicle emissions, it is crucial to find a solution to the issue of gas sensor selectivity. Equally important is the ability to detect low ppm concentrations of gases. Two-dimensional materials, also known as 2D materials, are superior candidates for high performance gas detection because of dramatic changes in resistivity upon molecular adsorption, high surface-to-volume ratio, tunable electronic properties, and high surface activities. In this review article, we give a brief introduction to the fascinating applications for various toxic gas sensing applications with a wide range of architectural designs. In this category are devices known as field effect transistors (FETs), which are based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), integration of TMDs with reduced graphene (TMDs/rGr), TMDs heterostructures (2D/2D), TMDs/metal interfaces, double heterostructures (2D/2D/2D), TMDs doped with metal–organic framework (MOF), and TMDs/MXene heterostructures. Due to the intriguing characteristics at the junction interface, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of 2D materials have a great deal of potential for electronic devices. The high-performance and low-power gas sensors that are essential in the Internet of Things (IoT) era and that significantly raise the standard of living the world over are constructed using the promising methods based on 2D materials in this overview. Finally, it concludes by summarizing the opportunities and challenges that are currently present.}

abstract = {A number of papers have surveyed mobile crowdsourcing systems and, to a lesser extent, situated crowdsourcing systems. These surveys have either contributed a comprehensive taxonomy of the diverse application domains where the systems have tapped into or have characterized different components of the system platforms. In this paper, we present a survey of mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by addressing fundamental questions about user contributions that system designers pose when building new systems or evaluating existing ones. We select and analyze 40 mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems for which prototypes were deployed and studied in the real world. Inspired by the MIT's genetic model of collective intelligence, we propose our genetic model and new genes for mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by examining user contributions to the selected systems. We present the observed patterns of different genes and discuss how the model can be used to create new applications and design ideas. By reviewing the existing design principles of online communities, we also provide examples to illustrate how unique genes inspire new design suggestions for encouraging user contributions in the context of mobile and situated crowdsourcing.}

To mimic the integrative sensing abilities found in nature, there is a significant interest in developing wearable devices that can smartly track the physiological and biochemical signals of the human body. Progress in wearable physical sensors has been remarkable giving rise to a number of consumer electronics products meant to measure parameters related to activity, posture, heart rate, respiration rate, and blood oxygen level. Comparatively, the progress in wearable chemical sensor development has been slower because of the inherent challenges in retrieving and processing bodily fluids. In this context, sweat provides a rich repository of biomarkers that is accessible continuously, on-the-go, and non-invasively. Here we provide a review of recent trends in the area of wearable sweat sensing with discussions on relevant topics of interest in material science, device development, sensing mechanisms, power generation, and data management. Exemplary wearable sweat sensors published in recent years are provided along with commercialization efforts in wearable sweat sensing. The review highlights the trends in multifunctional sensing platforms with flexible electronics that integrate data from both physical and biochemical sweat sensors.}

abstract = {Heat waves are becoming more common and intense around the world as a result of climate change, and they are affecting the resilience and livability of cities. Extreme heat can be fatal for people who are unacclimated or unable to seek relief. Heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable, yet public health efforts can at times fail to account for important contextual factors in their policy responses (e.g., differential vulnerability due to pre-existing medical conditions, where people live or work, or people's self-perception of risk). Understanding these contextual factors is an essential foundation for identifying policy responses that can make tangible progress in reducing heat-related illnesses and saving lives during extreme heat events. While extreme heat is an issue faced by communities internationally, we contend that a state or region-specific contextual and problem-oriented policy analysis, such as we present here, is critical to saving lives because: (1) many of the factors driving extreme heat vulnerability are local in nature and (2) the resilience strategies best suited to improve public health outcomes generally rely on local and state policy. This article examines the key factors conditioning public health impacts of extreme heat in Washington state based on the framework of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. Drawing upon our analysis of heat vulnerability in Washington state, we examine a suite of policy options within the context of Washington's communities that are tailored to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, or recover from heat waves and reduce heat-related illness and death in urban or suburban settings. We find extreme heat affects subpopulations differentially because of various contextual factors; this suggests a wide range of policy alternatives is necessary to meaningfully improve health outcomes community wide. Moreover, the array of policy alternatives often rely on agencies whose missions do not prioritize public health. We conclude that without mechanisms for formal coordination among implementing partners and agencies with an important role in protecting public health, important policy alternatives that serve vulnerable subpopulations will likely be neglected. We present this problem-oriented analysis of extreme heat in Washington state as a case study for identifying and evaluating contextually specific climate resilience strategies in the hopes that it can be useful across other geographies with different governance contexts, and perhaps even for other climate impacts.}

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

abstract = {Aims
To determine the accuracy of a wearable sensor to detect and differentiate episodes of self-reported craving and stress in individuals with substance use disorders, and to assess acceptability, barriers, and facilitators to sensor-based monitoring in this population.
Methods
This was an observational mixed methods pilot study. Adults enrolled in an outpatient treatment program for a substance use disorder wore a non-invasive wrist-mounted sensor for four days and self-reported episodes of stress and craving. Continuous physiologic data (accelerometry, skin conductance, skin temperature, and heart rate) were extracted from the sensors and analyzed via various machine learning algorithms. Semi-structured interviews were conducted upon study completion, and thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative data from semi-structured interviews.
Results
Thirty individuals completed the protocol, and 43 % (N = 13) were female. A total of 41 craving and 104 stress events were analyzed. The differentiation accuracies of the top performing models were as follows: stress vs. non-stress states 74.5 % (AUC 0.82), craving vs. no-craving 75.7 % (AUC 0.82), and craving vs. stress 76.8 % (AUC 0.8). Overall participant perception was positive, and acceptability was high. Emergent themes from the exit interviews included a perception of connectedness and increased mindfulness related to wearing the sensor, both of which were reported as helpful to recovery. Barriers to engagement included interference with other daily wear items, and perceived stigma.
Conclusions
Wearable sensors can be used to objectively differentiate episodes of craving and stress, and individuals in recovery from substance use disorder are accepting of continuous monitoring with these devices.}

The push for green and eco-friendly materials has intensified, driven by the mounting environmental concerns associated with traditional petroleum-based products. As land resources shrink and space for development narrows, marine biomaterials have emerged as a promising alternative over the past decades. Well-known for their vast availability, outstanding biocompatibility, impressive biodegradability, and minimal toxicity, marine biomaterials present an ideal foundation for developing eco-friendly triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this review, we present the evolution of TENGs based on marine biomaterials, from their core working principles to their multifaceted applications. We begin by elucidating the operational modes and foundational principles of TENGs. Next, we highlight the intrinsic qualities and advantages of marine biomaterials commonly utilized in TENG designs. Additionally, we discuss approaches adopted to amplify the efficacy of TENGs derived from marine biomaterials. A synthesis of documented applications of these TENGs from existing literature is then presented. We finally discuss the existing challenges and future directions in marine biomaterial-inspired TENGs.}

Extensive efforts have been made in both academia and industry in the research and development of smart wearable systems (SWS) for health monitoring (HM). Primarily influenced by skyrocketing healthcare costs and supported by recent technological advances in micro- and nanotechnologies, miniaturisation of sensors, and smart fabrics, the continuous advances in SWS will progressively change the landscape of healthcare by allowing individual management and continuous monitoring of a patient's health status. Consisting of various components and devices, ranging from sensors and actuators to multimedia devices, these systems support complex healthcare applications and enable low-cost wearable, non-invasive alternatives for continuous 24-h monitoring of health, activity, mobility, and mental status, both indoors and outdoors. Our objective has been to examine the current research in wearable to serve as references for researchers and provide perspectives for future research.
Methods
Herein, we review the current research and development of and the challenges facing SWS for HM, focusing on multi-parameter physiological sensor systems and activity and mobility measurement system designs that reliably measure mobility or vital signs and integrate real-time decision support processing for disease prevention, symptom detection, and diagnosis. For this literature review, we have chosen specific selection criteria to include papers in which wearable systems or devices are covered.
Results
We describe the state of the art in SWS and provide a survey of recent implementations of wearable health-care systems. We describe current issues, challenges, and prospects of SWS.

The measurement model was confirmed in both studies without any modifications. In both studies, the trust in technological companies and the trust in government agencies did not predict the perceived acceptance. In the first study, perceived availability of online risks predicted the acceptance through the full mediation of perceived online risks. The acceptance was also explained by perceived benefits. In the second study, the same structure was meaningful; however, the perceived risk was predicted by perceived benefits as well. Perceived benefits, acceptance and trust in technological companies were stronger among preservice teachers; whereas online risk perceptions were stronger among in-service teachers probably due to age-related risk perception differences.}

Since no objective measure of the actual stress level (output) is available, finding the stress index cannot be addressed as a classical regression problem. Instead, the proposed approach finds the linear combination of features that maximizes the separability of stress index values for non-stress and stress events. In short, RASMa combines linear discriminant analysis with the Bhattacharyya distance, embedded in a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme. A 26-case pilot study using 17 heart rate variability (HRV) features was conducted as a proof of concept. A near real-time application tool for monitoring stress level over time was also implemented based on the model obtained from the pilot study.}

abstract = {Introduction: Work Zones (WZs) have long been identified as a source of traffic fatalities and delays. Despite considerable technological advances that have alleviated many operational challenges associated with a WZ, social concerns about safety and mobility near WZs remain. Notably, the concept of a Smart Work Zone (SWZ) emerged from the compelling need to improve the safety and mobility of traffic and other WZ participants. This study reviewed the literature to assimilate studies related to SWZ Systems (SWZSs), report their findings, and ascertain a future path forward. Method: To accomplish this, the existing WZ-related literature base was clustered into safety and traffic mobility topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling. A thorough investigation of the pivotal inferences for the research topics was undertaken to comprehend current SWZ technologies and the need for further research. Results: The review uncovered the prominent features of SWZSs reported in the literature and the hindrances to their adoption. The most reported hindrances are the cost and effort associated with development, installation, and relocation. We uncover that Connected Autonomous Vehicles, vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, along with technology-based worker training are the most promising next frontier for SWZ. Conclusion: Significant research gaps exist in the literature regarding developing and implementing SWZS. Additionally, little effort has been directed toward developing workers’ skills and competency. Practical approaches such as Virtual Reality (VR)-based training are necessary to bring workers up to pace with the developing SWZ technologies. Practical Applications: Future research should be directed towards interconnecting and implementing available safety technologies to automate WZ safety and management. Workers should be trained using more practical techniques. In this context, using VR will enable the simulation of hazardous events in a safe environment while also improving workers’ skill retention.}

Looking at four principal stakeholders, we propose corporate digital responsibility (CDR) as a novel concept. We define CDR as the set of shared values and norms guiding an organization's operations with respect to four main processes related to digital technology and data. These processes are the creation of technology and data capture, operation and decision making, inspection and impact assessment, and refinement of technology and data. We expand our discussion by highlighting how to managerially effectuate CDR compliant behavior based on an organizational culture perspective. Our conceptualization unlocks future research opportunities, especially regarding pertinent antecedents and consequences. Managerially, we shed first light on how an organization's shared values and norms regarding CDR can get translated into actionable guidelines for users. This provides grounds for future discussions related to CDR readiness, implementation, and success.}

abstract = {High quality, reliable data and robust models are central to the development and appraisal of transportation planning and policy. Although conventional data may offer good ‘content’, it is widely observed that it lacks context i.e. who and why people are travelling. Transportation modelling has developed within these boundaries, with implications for the planning, design and management of transportation systems and policy-making. This paper establishes the potential of passively collected GPS-based “Track & Trace” (T&T) datasets of individual mobility profiles towards enhancing transportation modelling and policy-making. T&T is a type of New and Emerging Data Form (NEDF), lying within the broader ‘Big Data’ paradigm, and is typically collected using mobile phone sensors and related technologies. These capture highly grained mobility content and can be linked to the phone owner/user behavioural choices and other individual context. Our meta-analysis of existing literature related to spatio-temporal mobile phone data demonstrates that NEDF’s, and in particular T&T data, have had little mention to date within an applied transportation planning and policy context. We thus establish there is an opportunity for policy-makers, transportation modellers, researchers and a wide range of stakeholders to collaborate in developing new analytic approaches, revise existing models and build the skills and related capacity needed to lever greatest value from the data, as well as to adopt new business models that could revolutionise citizen participation in policy-making. This is of particular importance due to the growing awareness in many countries for a need to develop and monitor efficient cross-sectoral policies to deliver sustainable communities.}

abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has consumed our healthcare system, with immediate resource focus on the management of high numbers of critically ill patients. Those that fare poorly with COVID-19 infection more commonly have cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and diabetes. There are also several other conditions that raise concern for the welfare of patients with and at high risk for CVD during this pandemic. Traditional ambulatory care is disrupted and many patients are delaying or deferring necessary care, including preventive care. New impediments to medication access and adherence have arisen. Social distancing measures can increase social isolation and alter physical activity and nutrition patterns. Virtually all facility based cardiac rehabilitation programs have temporarily closed. If not promptly addressed, these changes may result in delayed waves of vulnerable patients presenting for urgent and preventable CVD events. Here, we provide several recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects of these disruptions in outpatient care. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be continued in patients already taking these medications. Where possible, it is strongly preferred to continue visits via telehealth, and patients should be counselled about promptly reporting new symptoms. Barriers to medication access should be reviewed with patients at every contact, with implementation of strategies to ensure ongoing provision of medications. Team-based care should be leveraged to enhance the continuity of care and adherence to lifestyle recommendations. Patient encounters should include discussion of safe physical activity options and access to healthy food choices. Implementation of adaptive strategies for cardiac rehabilitation is recommended, including home based cardiac rehab, to ensure continuity of this essential service. While the practical implementation of these strategies will vary by local situation, there are a broad range of strategies available to ensure ongoing continuity of care and health preservation for those at higher risk of CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

Participants completed the crime scene report using either the conventional paper form, an electronic form on a tablet computer (to represent the current trend in digitisation of crime scene reports), or a wearable computer (with speech input). While both computer conditions (tablet and wearable) led to faster performance, when compared with the paper condition, there was no difference in content or quality of the reports produced in any of the three conditions; thus, the computer conditions produced acceptable reports in much faster time when compared to conventional practice. Furthermore, activity sampling analysis showed that participants found it much easier to integrate the wearable computer (than either paper forms or tablet computer) into their search and recovery activity.}

This paper examines how people rely, understand and trust tornado alerts and the Early Warning Systems (EWS) that disseminate them, if socio-demographics cause specific groups to experience greater risk, whether these factors have affected the rise in fatalities and what mitigation measures could reverse this. Ford County, Kansas, was selected as a case study. Interviews were conducted with officials and an online survey marketed through Facebook was undertaken, receiving 547 responses. Results showed white men were particularly vulnerable to tornadoes as they were more likely to ignore warnings. Hispanics, older people and those with tornado experience were also at higher risk if they heard an alert from an EWS they distrusted or did not understand. Population growth in these groups and technology changes have helped cause the recent fatality rise and, unless changes are made to the EWS, the continued increase in size of these groups will lead to more people becoming at risk from, or perishing in, tornadoes. Recommendations to prevent this include federal regulation and improved education materials for sirens, alerts translated into Spanish, discontinuing NOAA radio and developing an official forecast and alerting app.}

This research compared shooting performance and underlying postural mechanics of Expert and Novice marksmen during a dynamic, live-fire shooting task. Eighteen military personnel volunteered to participate in this study (n = 9 Experts and n = 9 Novices). All participants completed the dynamic marksmanship task with an M4 carbine under each of two equipment conditions: (I) a No Load Condition (6 kg) and (II) a Loaded Condition (31 kg) using standard-issue military equipment. Marksmanship performance was assessed using lethality measures including total hits and course efficiency. Postural mechanics were collected via body- and weapon-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Significant differences (p < 0.05) in shooting performance and course efficiency were found between Expert and Novice marksmen for both load conditions. Significant differences were also found in postural movement patterns between Expert and Novice marksmen utilizing IMU-derived performance measures, especially when transitioning between targets, though these findings were not always consistent across load conditions. Based on these results, training interventions that focus on target acquisition, increasing torso stability, and maximizing the linkage between the torso and weapon could be recommended to improve performance in Novice marksmen.}

The growing use and functionality of UAVs increases the chances that a digital forensics investigation of a UAV could be required to investigate an accident, incident or just the appearance of a UAV in a specific geographical location. As a result, both industry and academia have published a number of guidelines and publications concerning the forensic investigation of UAV systems. The focus of this paper is the academic perspective of UAV forensics. Specifically, we present a systematic survey of the UAV forensics literature, with the purpose of identifying and documenting research trends describing the digital forensic investigation of UAV incidents, accidents and crimes. The findings from the survey identify the need for an enhanced digital forensics framework to help guide future UAV investigations, as well as a number of research themes that are currently unaddressed in the literature. The research contributions are three-fold. First, the paper categorizes, through a taxonomy, previous UAV forensics literature concerning UAV forensics artifacts, frameworks and models for undertaking UAV forensic investigations, forensic readiness for UAVs, and tools that have been used to conduct UAV forensic investigations. Second, using the findings from the literature, we propose and describe the Conceptual Drone Forensic Framework (CDFF), which attempts to address shortcomings in previous UAV forensics models and frameworks. Third, the paper sets the foundation for future research in UAV forensics by proposing three unaddressed research themes that could help enhance future UAV forensic investigations.}

It suggests that, while there are significant similarities between their respective sources, tools and purposes, there are also arguable differences between consumer protection law and data protection law. One such arguable difference is found in that, while consumer protection law can be seen to merely set a floor in its pursuit of a sufficiently high level of consumer protection, data protection law – due to its clearly articulated dual purposes of (a) protecting individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and (b) providing for the free movement of such data – sets both a floor and a ceiling. Having discussed the relationship between consumer protection law and data protection law in more detail, the argument is made that it seems possible to conclude that the balance struck in the Data Protection Directive, and soon in the General Data Protection Regulation, places limitations on consumer protection law. The implications of this conclusion are then examined briefly in the context of some matters currently coming before the CJEU and the contours of a framework are presented, addressing situations where a data protection-based liability claim is pursued against a third-party non-controller under consumer protection law.}

Prior studies look at people's evaluations in isolation without pitting costs and benefits against each other. We address this limitation with a conjoint experiment (N = 979), using six domains (criminal investigations, crime prevention, citizen scores, healthcare, banking, and employment), where we simultaneously test the relative influence of four factors: the status quo, outcome favorability, data sharing, and data protection on decisions to adopt and perceptions of moral acceptability of the technologies. We present two key findings. (1) People adopt technologies more often when data is protected and when outcomes are favorable. They place equal or more importance on data protection in all domains except healthcare where outcome favorability has the strongest influence. (2) Data protection is the strongest driver of moral acceptability in all domains except healthcare, where the strongest driver is outcome favorability. Additionally, sharing data lowers preference for all technologies, but has a relatively smaller influence. People do not show a status quo bias in the adoption of technologies. When evaluating moral acceptability, people show a status quo bias but this is driven by the citizen scores domain. Differences across domains arise from differences in magnitude of the effects but the effects are in the same direction. Taken together, these results highlight that people are not always primarily driven by self-interest and do place importance on potential privacy violations. The results also challenge the assumption that people generally prefer the status quo.}

The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was performed to verify a significant difference between the labeled states. Then, RevitalMe classified psychological states based on physiological measurements through machine learning, associating them with the behavior of the individual. After that, visual insights were generated through contexts processing and presented to psychotherapists as evidence of an individual’s daily behavior and psychological state. Twelve psychotherapists evaluated the clinical acceptability of RevitalMe, answering six quantitative statements and two qualitative questions. Furthermore, a t-Test was performed to investigate clinical acceptability given therapy field and clinical years. Results: The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test succeeds in proving that labeled states were statistically significant, and RevitalMe achieved an F1-Score of 75% in the binary classification of stressed states in natural environments. The evaluation showed clinical acceptability of 90%, composed by partial agreement of 62% and a total agreement of 28%. In this regard, the t-Test provided that the level of interest from cognitive-behavior therapists in psychophysiological insight was higher than that from psychodynamic therapists. Conclusions: The psychophysiological insights approximate cognitive-behavior psychotherapy to individual’s behavior and daily events, focusing on assistance in mental healthcare.}

abstract = {One hundred years have passed since the discovery of insulin—an achievement that transformed diabetes from a fatal illness into a manageable chronic condition. The decades since that momentous achievement have brought ever more rapid innovation and advancement in diabetes research and clinical care. To celebrate the important work of the past century and help to chart a course for its continuation into the next, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes and the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recently held a joint international symposium, bringing together a cohort of researchers with diverse interests and backgrounds from both countries and beyond to discuss their collective quest to better understand the heterogeneity of diabetes and thus gain insights to inform new directions in diabetes treatment and prevention. This article summarizes the proceedings of that symposium, which spanned cutting-edge research into various aspects of islet biology, the heterogeneity of diabetic phenotypes, and the current state of and future prospects for precision medicine in diabetes.
Résumé
Cent ans se sont écoulés depuis la découverte de l'insuline - un succès qui a converti le diabète, maladie mortelle, en une affection chronique gérable. Les décennies qui ont suivi cette découverte capitale ont apporté des innovations et des progrès toujours plus rapides dans la recherche sur le diabète et les soins cliniques. Pour célébrer l'important travail accompli au cours du siècle dernier et aider à tracer la voie pour le poursuivre au cours du prochain siècle, l'Institut de la nutrition, du métabolisme et du diabète porté par les Instituts de Recherche en Santé du Canada et son pendant américain le «National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases» des Instituts américains de la santé (NIH) ont récemment tenu un symposium international conjoint, qui a réuni une cohorte de chercheurs aux intérêts et aux formations variés, provenant des deux pays et d'ailleurs, pour discuter de leur quête collective d'une meilleure compréhension de l'hétérogénéité du diabète et, par conséquent, de nouvelles orientations dans le traitement et la prévention du diabète. Cet article résume les comptes rendus de ce symposium, qui a porté sur la recherche de pointe dans divers aspects de la biologie des îlots de Langerhans, l'hétérogénéité des phénotypes diabétiques, ainsi que l'état actuel et les perspectives de la médecine de précision dans le diabète.}

In the present paper, we consider human cooperative behaviour in front of wearable security cameras. Moreover, we propose a human cooperation detection pipeline based on deep learning. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have shown remarkable performance on several tasks such as image captioning, video analysis, or natural language processing. Our proposal describes an RNN architecture with the aim at detecting whether a human is exhibiting an adversarial behaviour by trying to avoid the camera. This data is obtained by analysing the noise patterns of human movement. More specifically, we are not only providing an extensive analysis on the proposed pipeline considering different configurations and a wide variety of RNN types, but also an ensemble of the generated models to outperform each single model. The experiment has been carried out using videos captured from a mobile device camera (GOTCHA Dataset) and the obtained results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Background
Many African hospitals participate in technology research studies that take many months or years. Fewer sites have experience with rapid studies, conducted over a period of weeks. Such studies can benefit the institution and its patients in the short term, and in the long term can help prepare the institution for adopting the new technology.
Objectives
We conducted a rapid validation study of consumer fitness device at Mulago National Referral and Teaching Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. In doing so, we captured valuable lessons about how to conduct a rapid study that will be useful to future researchers conducting similar fast-paced studies.
Methods
We conducted a descriptive study of a convenience sample of 57 patients. Patients who volunteered wore a fitness wristband device. Study staff collected vital signs using standard approaches.
Findings
Our findings were as follows: (1) effective partnership by local experts can ensure success; (2) a PI with experience working with the hospital ethics committee is essential to a rapid study; (3) reassurance that the study design benefits patients and the institution can help speed approval; (4) conduct detailed assessment of patient population in advance; (5) allow sufficient time for logistics arrangements; (6) quickly pivot the approach as needed, consistent with the protocol; (7) conduct data quality review on every shift; (8) conduct a supplies inventory at the end of each shift; (9) make rapid decisions about hiring and discontinuing study staff; (10) implement a patient location protocol at the start of the study; and (11) ensure availability of study staff refreshments in the study room.
Conclusion
A rapid study of innovative technology can be successful at a hospital in a resource-limited setting.}

abstract = {Heating and cooling of buildings consume approximately 15% of all energy used in the United States. Such a large energy demand is primarily due to heating and cooling of the entire building space to temperature setpoints usually between 21.1 °C (70 °F) and 23.9 °C (75 °F). However, even with such a narrow range of temperature setpoints, more than 20% of the occupants do not feel thermally comfortable due to individual differences (e.g. age, gender, clothing, or physiology). The personal thermal management techniques, which create a local thermal envelope around a human body instead of heating or cooling the entire building space, have the potential to greatly reduce the building energy consumption and to enhance thermal comfort of individuals. In this study, a portable thermoelectric energy conversion unit (TECU) that converts electricity into cooling and heating energy is developed. The TECU supplies cool air (in the cooling mode) or warm air (in the heating mode) to regulate the thermal comfort of a human body. The cool or warm air is supplied through a tree-like rubber tube network that is knitted into a thermoregulatory undergarment. To achieve a cooling/heating target that provides satisfactory thermal comfort, the required cooling/heating power supply from the TECU is determined first while a theoretical model is then developed to guide the design of the TECU. To minimize the TECU weight and make it suitable for portable applications, relationships between weight and thermal resistances of commercial off-the-shelf heat sinks are established first, and a method to find the minimal weight of heat sinks for the TECU is then developed. This methodology is also applicable for other applications where heat sink weight needs to be minimized. The thermal manikin tests demonstrate that 24.6 W of personal cooling power and 18.5 W of personal heating power are achieved by using the TECU.}

However, little efforts have been made to quantitatively examine the factors influencing construction workers’ acceptance of PPE. Method: In the current study, a PPE acceptance model for construction workers (PAMCW) was proposed to address the noted need. The PAMCW incorporates the technology acceptance model, theory of planned behavior, risk perception, and safety climate for explaining construction worker acceptance of PPE. 413 construction workers participated in this study to fill out a structured questionnaire. The PAMCW was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results: Results provide evidence of the applicability of the technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior to the PPE acceptance among construction workers. The positive influence of safety climate and risk perception-severity on attitude toward using PPE was significant. Safety climate positively influences perceived usefulness. Risk perception-worry and unsafe was found to positively affect intention to use PPE. Practical Applications: Practical suggestions for increasing construction workers’ use of PPE are also discussed.}

Legislation surrounding the use of in-vehicle technologies are explored in this paper from a socio-technical system perspective. This reveals the wider context of the road transport system operating under the current laws using an Accimap analysis. A distinction in the law between the use of hand-held mobile phones, a device that is typically banned for use by drivers worldwide, and the use of other technological devices that are covered by more general laws against ‘careless’ and/or ‘dangerous’ driving was found. Historically, individual drivers’ have been blamed for distraction, whereas the systems approach shows how current legislation may have created the conditions necessary for driver distraction.}

Creative use of new mobile and wearable health information and sensing technologies (mHealth) has the potential to reduce the cost of health care and improve well-being in numerous ways. These applications are being developed in a variety of domains, but rigorous research is needed to examine the potential, as well as the challenges, of utilizing mobile technologies to improve health outcomes. Currently, evidence is sparse for the efficacy of mHealth. Although these technologies may be appealing and seemingly innocuous, research is needed to assess when, where, and for whom mHealth devices, apps, and systems are efficacious. In order to outline an approach to evidence generation in the field of mHealth that would ensure research is conducted on a rigorous empirical and theoretic foundation, on August 16, 2011, researchers gathered for the mHealth Evidence Workshop at NIH. The current paper presents the results of the workshop. Although the discussions at the meeting were cross-cutting, the areas covered can be categorized broadly into three areas: (1) evaluating assessments; (2) evaluating interventions; and (3) reshaping evidence generation using mHealth. This paper brings these concepts together to describe current evaluation standards, discuss future possibilities, and set a grand goal for the emerging field of mHealth research.}

abstract = {Background
Previous research demonstrates that results from observational research correlate well with results from clinical trials, and if the former are well designed these can guide clinical practice. Observational studies in cardiac arrest research are beset by confounding due to illness severity and comorbidity. We aimed to count the number of studies that utilize comorbidity and illness severity scores and indices, and to measure the change in results across analyses that adjust for scores and indices.
Methods
A systematic search of databases for cardiac arrest studies that report survival outcomes for 2015 and that utilize illness severity and comorbidity indices and scores was conducted. We quantified the proportion of studies and the change in magnitude of estimates when adjustment for indices and scores were used.
Results
Sixty (28%) of 213 cardiac arrest studies that report survival outcomes utilize illness severity or comorbidity indices and scores, of which 39 studies (65%) used risk scores and indices to account for the confounding effect of comorbidity or illness severity. A 14% change towards the null in the magnitude of effect sizes was apparent when models included illness severity or comorbidity adjustment (interquartile range −37.7 to 4.4).
Conclusions
A small proportion of cardiac arrest studies account for illness severity and comorbidity with scores and indices, and such adjustment tend to drive estimates towards the null (no difference in groups being compared). Confounding by illness severity and comorbidity is a significant source of bias in non-randomized cardiac arrest studies.}

The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.}

As behaviour and analysis are closely related to psychology, many techniques exist to collect relevant data. The IoB improves the doctor’s and patient’s experience. As IoT and IoB are interconnected, IoB technology collects and analyses data depending on user activity. These offer a practical technique for developing real-time remote health monitoring systems. This technology aids in the optimisation of auto insurance premiums in the healthcare sector. It tries to alter patient behaviour in order to improve the treatment process. IoB has applications in various areas, including retail and entertainment, and has the potential to change the marketing sector significantly. This technology is helpful for the appropriate analysis and comprehension of behavioural data used for creating valuable services for treatment. The primary purpose of this paper is to study IoB and its need for healthcare. The working process structure and features of IoB for the healthcare domain are studied. This paper further identifies and analyses the significant applications of IoB for healthcare. In the future, IoB technologies will give us a higher quality of life and well-being. IoB is the ideal fusion of technology, data analytics, and behavioural science.

The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. Our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners’ thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making.}

Driving measures are frequently collapsed to summary levels across the study period, excluding more fine-grained differences such as changes that occur from trip to trip. By retaining trip-specific data, it is possible to quantify how much a driver differs from trip to trip (within-person variability) in addition to how he or she differs from other drivers (between-person variability). To the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to use multilevel modeling to quantify variability in distracted driving behavior in a naturalistic dataset of older drivers. The current study demonstrates the utility of examining within-person variability in a naturalistic driving dataset of 68 older drivers across two weeks. First, multilevel models were conducted for three distracted driving behaviors to distinguish within-person variability from between-person variability in these behaviors. A high percentage of variation in distracted driving behaviors was attributable to within-person differences, indicating that drivers’ behaviors varied more across their own driving trips than from other drivers (ICCs = .93). Then, to demonstrate the utility of personal characteristics in predicting daily driving behavior, a hypothetical model is presented using simulated daily sleep duration from the previous night to predict distracted driving behavior the following day. The current study demonstrates substantial variability in driving behaviors within an older adult sample and the promise of individual characteristics to provide better prediction of driving behaviors relevant to safety, which can be applied in investigations of current naturalistic driving datasets and in designing future studies.}

We analyze the case of the Google Glass failure to establish this ARSG (Augmented Reality Smart Glasses) extension to Google's digital platform. The paper contributes to the study of controversies by analyzing the digital platform innovation process as a process of translation, in which there are possible controversy emergence points originated in types of disagreements among the different human actors involved and their interactions with non-human elements. These disagreements are related to specific features of digital platforms: the digital platform generativity, the multisided market arrangements in the platform; the loosely coupled layers of technologies and applications involved, and the opaqueness that results from these arrangements. The framework proposed can support digital platform scholars and practitioners to in better understand and manage controversies.}

First, it introduces a socio-material analytic for the study of design materials, and exemplifies this analysis with respect to video data of designers’ uses of sticky notes. Second, it illustrates how the material properties of sticky notes come to have interactional consequences in the performance of particular social actions. Four general thematic considerations emerge from this socio-material analysis of sticky notes: (1) a reappreciation of the embodiment of space, ownership and actions-with-notes; (2) the interactional history of notes; (3) the social and conceptual inertia of gestalt contextures; and (4) the unity of the social, material and conceptual in embodied design activity.}

abstract = {Purpose
Emergency Department (ED) visits are costly to the health service and alternative care pathways may address this whilst improving outcomes. We aimed to describe decision-making and preferences of people with epilepsy (PWE) during emergency service use, and views of ED alternatives, including use of an Urgent Treatment Centre and telephone-based support from an epilepsy nurse specialist.
Methods
We conducted a community-based interview study in South East England, informed by a qualitative framework approach. 25 adults with epilepsy and 5 of their carers took part.
Results
Participants’ choice to attend ED generally corresponded with guidelines, including continuing seizures and injury. Nevertheless, over half reported unwanted or unnecessary ED attendance, mainly due to lack of access to individual patient history, a carer, or seizures occurring in a public place. Participants used proactive strategies to communicate their care needs to others, including 24 -h alarm devices and care plans. Some suggested preventative strategies including referral after ED. Participants highlighted the importance of ambulance staff in providing fast and efficient care that gives reassurance.
Conclusion
Improving communication and access to preventative, proactive services may facilitate better outcomes within existing care pathways. PWE felt ED alternatives were helpful in some circumstances, but Urgent Treatment Centres or epilepsy nurse specialists were not viewed as an ED replacement.}

Here, we describe a soft-bioelectronic platform that uses a thermal expansion valve to collect sweat under programmed time control. By incorporating expandable microspheres, the skin-interfaced microfluidic device platform merges capillary burst valves and irreversible-thermal expansion valves. An expansion layer below the microfluidic channels expands irreversibly upon heat delivery from underlying microheaters. The thermal expansion valve isolates the collected sweat into separate chambers to minimize internal mixing. The human study demonstrates that our novel time-programmed sweat collection device improved sweat analyte data (sweat volume, pH, lactate, and cortisol) from the conventional sweat collection. In addition, the human study results indicate a correlation between sweat rate and sweat lactate with aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Our approach can be integrated with past and current microfluidic systems and other chemical sensing modalities, such as colorimetric and electrochemical measurements of sweat analytes present in current sweat devices for advanced on-board diagnostics.}

The five phases of cognitive work analysis were developed using data gathered via document analysis, behavioural observation, walk-throughs and critical decision method interviews. The analysis demonstrates the complex nature of pedestrian decision making at RLXs and the findings are synthesised to provide a model illustrating the influences on pedestrian decision making in this context (i.e. time, effort and social pressures). Further, the CWA outputs are used to inform an analysis of the risks to safety associated with pedestrian behaviour at RLXs and the identification of potential interventions to reduce risk.}

A substantial amount of research has been conducted on HAR and numerous approaches based on deep learning have been exploited by the research community to classify human activities. The main goal of this review is to summarize recent works based on a wide range of deep neural networks architecture, namely convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for human activity recognition. The reviewed systems are clustered into four categories depending on the use of input devices like multimodal sensing devices, smartphones, radar, and vision devices. This review describes the performances, strengths, weaknesses, and the used hyperparameters of CNN architectures for each reviewed system with an overview of available public data sources. In addition, a discussion of the current challenges to CNN-based HAR systems is presented. Finally, this review is concluded with some potential future directions that would be of great assistance for the researchers who would like to contribute to this field. We conclude that CNN-based approaches are suitable for effective and accurate human activity recognition system applications despite challenges including availability of data regarding composite or group activities, high computational resource requirements, data privacy concerns, and edge computing limitations. For widespread adaptation, future research should be focused on more efficient edge computing techniques, datasets incorporating contextual information with activities, more explainable methodologies, and more robust systems.}

In this sense, the enforcement of the use of masks in crowded areas has been a recurrent concern of governments, which has fostered the development of camera-based approaches to automatically detect people without face masks. In order to tackle this problem, this article proposes a low-cost approach based on the use of affordable and energy-efficient microcontrollers to quickly process images and detect when people are not wearing face masks, performing local decisions. For this on-the-edge processing, reduced Machine Learning models were created and evaluated through different techniques. As a result, a complete processing pipeline was designed to perform a transfer learning process taking as reference the MobileNet model supported by the Edge Impulse platform, achieving an innovative TinyML solution for quick decisions on resource-constrained Internet of Things units. Additionally, we performed a series of experiments on the Arduino Nano 33 board attached to an OV7675 camera module, evaluating the practical application of the proposed solution after proper training using public image datasets. Working as a soft-sensor unit that is reproducible and ready to be used, the defined trainable model and the performed evaluation results represent a significant contribution towards real-world deployment of face masks detection systems.}

abstract = {Context
Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task.
Objective
This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand.
Method
GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime.
Results
We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community – the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.
Conclusion
GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.}

abstract = {Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have become the primary health concern for most countries around the world. Currently, more than 36 million people worldwide die from NCDs each year, accounting for 63% of annual global deaths; most are preventable. The global financial burden of NCDs is staggering, with an estimated 2010 global cost of $6.3 trillion (US dollars) that is projected to increase to $13 trillion by 2030. A number of NCDs share one or more common predisposing risk factors, all related to lifestyle to some degree: (1) cigarette smoking, (2) hypertension, (3) hyperglycemia, (4) dyslipidemia, (5) obesity, (6) physical inactivity, and (7) poor nutrition. In large part, prevention, control, or even reversal of the aforementioned modifiable risk factors are realized through leading a healthy lifestyle (HL). The challenge is how to initiate the global change, not toward increasing documentation of the scope of the problem but toward true action—creating, implementing, and sustaining HL initiatives that will result in positive, measurable changes in the previously defined poor health metrics. To achieve this task, a paradigm shift in how we approach NCD prevention and treatment is required. The goal of this American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation/American College of Preventive Medicine policy statement is to define key stakeholders and highlight their connectivity with respect to HL initiatives. This policy encourages integrated action by all stakeholders to create the needed paradigm shift and achieve broad adoption of HL behaviors on a global scale.}

abstract = {Background
Accurate situation awareness has been identified as a critical component of effective deteriorating patient response systems and an essential patient safety skill for nursing practice. However, situation awareness has been defined and theorised from multiple perspectives to explain how individuals, teams and systems maintain awareness in dynamic task environments.
Aim
Our aim was to critically analyse the different approaches taken to the study of situation awareness in healthcare and explore the implications for nursing practice and research as it relates to clinical deterioration in ward contexts.
Methods
We undertook a meta-narrative review of the healthcare literature to capture how situation awareness has been defined, theorised and studied in healthcare. Following an initial scoping review, we conducted an extensive search of ten electronic databases and included any theoretical, empirical or critical papers with a primary focus on situation awareness in an inpatient hospital setting. Included papers were collaboratively categorised in accordance with their theoretical framing, research tradition and paradigm with a narrative review presented.
Results
A total of 120 papers were included in this review. Three overarching narratives reflecting philosophical, patient safety and solution focussed framings of situation awareness and seven meta-narratives were identified as follows: individual, team and systems perspectives of situation awareness (meta-narratives 1–3), situation awareness and patient safety (meta-narrative 4), communication tools, technologies and education to support situation awareness (meta-narratives 5–7). We identified a concentration of literature from anaesthesia and operating rooms and a body of research largely located within a cognitive engineering tradition and a positivist research paradigm. Endsley's situation awareness model was applied in over 80% of the papers reviewed. A minority of papers drew on alternative situation awareness theories including constructivist, collaborative and distributed perspectives.
Conclusions
Nurses have a critical role in identifying and escalating the care of deteriorating patients. There is a need to build on prior studies and reflect on the reality of nurse's work and the constraints imposed on situation awareness by the demands of busy inpatient wards. We suggest that this will require an analysis that complements but goes beyond the dominant cognitive engineering tradition to reflect the complex socio-cultural reality of ward-based teams and to explore how situation awareness emerges in increasingly complex, technologically enabled distributed healthcare systems.}

abstract = {Increased life expectancy coupled with declining birth rates is leading to an aging population structure. Aging-caused changes, such as physical or cognitive decline, could affect people's quality of life, result in injuries, mental health or the lack of physical activity. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the most promising assistive technologies to support older people's daily life, which has enabled enormous potential in human-centred applications. Recent surveys in HAR either only focus on the deep learning approaches or one specific sensor modality. This survey aims to provide a more comprehensive introduction for newcomers and researchers to HAR. We first introduce the state-of-art sensor modalities in HAR. We look more into the techniques involved in each step of wearable sensor modality centred HAR in terms of sensors, activities, data pre-processing, feature learning and classification, including both conventional approaches and deep learning methods. In the feature learning section, we focus on both hand-crafted features and automatically learned features using deep networks. We also present the ambient-sensor-based HAR, including camera-based systems, and the systems which combine the wearable and ambient sensors. Finally, we identify the corresponding challenges in HAR to pose research problems for further improvement in HAR.}

abstract = {Human behavior inference through smart pervasive technologies is a new research avenue. Sophistication in interaction modalities with self-customization based on context makes interaction easier in natural settings. Despite greater sophistication, disabled and elderly person still face difficulties in interaction with smart devices. The interaction generally depends on two or more sensory channels simultaneously, which is a big concern for persons with impaired vision and hearing. Person with dual sensory loss face problem in interaction with smart devices. Interaction can be effectively possible with this population group using alternative tactile sensory channel and vibro-tactile stimuli could be a great alternative for communication in natural settings to accommodate their needs. Feature-rich handheld and wearable smart devices could be the cost-effective substitute for assisting in ADL in natural settings for disabled and elderly person. Religious worships are important part of human life. By exploiting the advanced sensing technologies in Smartphone, an assistive prayer model is developed which is aimed at assisting deafblind person in semi-isolated natural settings, in a cost-effective manner which emphasizes on utilization of alternative sensory channels of a human. The model is validated through an App SmartPrayerAid aimed to assist deafblind Muslim in offering Islamic worship Namaz in congregational setting. Comprehensive evaluation of the App was conducted to prove the validity of the model and the aptness of the smart devices for assisting disabled person in natural settings. The evaluation was conducted with deafblind, non-deafblind and non-disabled subjects in controlled lab environment. Results indicated that speech recognition was achieved between 77.76% in real environment, while up to 96.29% in controlled lab environment using online speech recognition in Arabic. Effectiveness of Vibro-tactile stimuli perception using Smartphone on different body parts was also evaluated and accuracy in detection observed on front pocket of shirt was 84.29%, front pocket of the trousers was 92.14% and on upper arm was 52.43% and on wrist of the right hand using Smartwatch was observed 97.62%. The model can be utilized in other natural settings in similar situations after slight modification to assist a deafblind person in performing ADL and other social activities.}

There are scientific articles covering recommendation approaches in smart city applications, and there are recommendation solutions implemented in real world smart city initiatives. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive review of the state of the art on recommender systems for smart cities. For this reason, in this paper we present a taxonomy of smart city features, dimensions, actions and goals, and, according to these variables, we survey the existing literature on recommender systems. As a result of our survey, we do not only identify and analyze main research trends, but also show current opportunities and challenges where personalized recommendations could be exploited as solutions for citizens, firms and public administrations.}

While IoT is still a growing and expanding platform, the current research in privacy and security shows there is little integration and unification of security and privacy that may affect user adoption of the technology because of fear of personal data exposure. The surveys conducted so far focus on vulnerabilities based on information exchange technologies applicable to the Internet. None of the surveys has brought out the integrated privacy and security perspective centered on the user. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader with a comprehensive discussion on the current state of the art of IoT, with particular focus on what have been done in the areas of privacy and security threats, attack surface, vulnerabilities and countermeasures and to propose a threat taxonomy. IoT user requirements and challenges were identified and discussed to highlight the baseline security and privacy needs and concerns of the user. The paper also proposed threat taxonomy to address the security requirements in broader perspective. This survey of IoT Privacy and Security has been undertaken through a systematic literature review using online databases and other resources to search for all articles that meet certain criteria, entering information about each study into a personal database, and then drawing up tables summarizing the current state of literature. As a result, the paper distills the latest developments in IoT privacy and security, highlights the open issues and identifies areas for further research.}

Our study aims at examining the adoption factors of social media and the impact of their use in managing disaster. We proposed and empirically validated a research model drawn on three combined theories: TAM, the diffusion-of-innovation theory and the Kahn’s framework of psychological conditions and agility. The obtained model was tested with a sample of 418 respondents using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling method (PLS-SEM). The study revealed the following two main outputs: (i) social media platforms are perceived to be easy to use, useful with a perceived relative advantage, and are therefore essential for disaster management; and (ii) the use of social media impacts information accessibility, adaptability, proactiveness and resilience.}

Those include but are not limited to, increasing economic efficiency, reducing cost and decreasing environmental output. However, the smart city itself is still in its infancy. As it heavily relies on technologies, it opens up doors to cyber attackers and criminals, which can lead to significant losses. An outstanding problem concerns the social and organisational aspects of smart cities security resulting from competing interests of different parties, high levels of interdependence, and social and political complexity. Our review shows that current standards and guidelines have not clearly defined roles and responsibilities of different parties. A common understanding of key security requirements is not shared between different parties. This research assessed the smart cities and their cyber security measures, with a particular focus on technical standards and the regulatory framework. It comprehensively reviewed 93 security standards and guidance. It then performed a comparative case study of Barcelona, Singapore and London smart cities on their governance models, security measures, technical standards and third party management. Based on the review and the case study, this research concluded on a recommended framework encompassing technical standards, governance input, regulatory framework and compliance assurance to ensure that security is observed at all layers of the smart cities.}

Objective
Presented work highlights the development and initial validation of a medical embedded device for individualized care (MEDIC), which is based on a novel software architecture, enabling sensor management and disease prediction capabilities, and commercially available microelectronic components, sensors and conventional personal digital assistant (PDA) (or a cell phone).
Methods and materials
In this paper, we present a general architecture for a wearable sensor system that can be customized to an individual patient’s needs. This architecture is based on embedded artificial intelligence that permits autonomous operation, sensor management and inference, and may be applied to a general purpose wearable medical diagnostics.
Results
A prototype of the system has been developed based on a standard PDA and wireless sensor nodes equipped with commercially available Bluetooth radio components, permitting real-time streaming of high-bandwidth data from various physiological and contextual sensors. We also present the results of abnormal gait diagnosis using the complete system from our evaluation, and illustrate how the wearable system and its operation can be remotely configured and managed by either enterprise systems or medical personnel at centralized locations.
Conclusion
By using commercially available hardware components and software architecture presented in this paper, the MEDIC system can be rapidly configured, providing medical researchers with broadband sensor data from remote patients and platform access to best adapt operation for diagnostic operation objectives.}

By 2030, a 50% rise in lighting demand of the existing consumption is projected due to an increase in the global population. To address the concern of rising lighting electricity consumption, the key strategy is to develop and provide energy efficient lighting products to consumers. In this respect, the Solid-State Lighting (SSL) has the potential to offer power efficiencies that are superior to those of conventional lighting sources. Recently, white organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have emerged as the leading technology for the new display and lighting market which has attracted substantial attention of manufacturers, product designers, and end users. OLED devices have already entered into high end lighting markets such as designer, automotive, aerospace, high-end architectural lighting, and other applications. Moreover, innovative flexible OLED devices are thought to be candidates for the next-generation SSL systems, wearable electronics, mobile devices, microdisplays, etc. as they are lighter, thinner and more durable compared to glass (rigid) based devices. In the present review, distinctive features of OLEDs SSL lighting, technical requirements of lighting for applications, OLED basic, and classification of OLED devices, including quantum dot (QD) OLEDs (QLED) as well as the need of development of OLEDs standards are discussed. Various constituents of flexible OLED lighting, OLED lighting panels by some manufacturers, hurdles in OLED lighting technologies, performance of OLEDs in harsh conditions, challenges in flexible OLEDs, OLED lighting technology comparison, OLED lighting roadmap, and future directions including cost reduction analysis, flexible OLED incorporated into automotive, IoT (Internet of Things) connected lighting system, OLED market projections, etc. are also presented. It is suggested that the white OLEDs, and flexible OLEDs in particular, lighting products have potential to revolutionize the future of lighting systems, industries, and the market.}

With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new ‘symbiotic digital architecture’ to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.}

abstract = {Remote sensing of night light emissions in the visible band offers a unique opportunity to directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development. The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal changes during the night (for example from a geostationary platform or constellation of satellites), and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission (roughly analogous to the BRDF in daylight sensing). Perhaps most importantly, we make the case that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions, and monitor energy use.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

abstract = {A system is context-aware if it can extract, interpret and use context information and adapt its functionality to the current context of use. Multi-agent planning generalizes the problem of planning in domains where several agents plan and act together, and share resources, activities, and goals. This contribution presents a practical extension of a formal theoretical model for Context-Aware Multi-Agent Planning based upon an argumentation-based defeasible logic. Our framework, named CAMAP, is implemented on a platform for open multi-agent systems and has been experimentally tested, among others, in applications of ambient intelligence in the field of health-care. CAMAP is based on a multi-agent partial-order planning paradigm in which agents have diverse abilities, use an argumentation-based defeasible contextual reasoning to support their own beliefs and refute the beliefs of the others according to their context knowledge during the plan search process. CAMAP shows to be an adequate approach to tackle ambient intelligence problems as it gathers together in a single framework the ability of planning while it allows agents to put forward arguments that support or argue upon the accuracy, unambiguity and reliability of the context-aware information.}

abstract = {Recent technological breakthroughs and significant expansion in the number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, a new paradigm of unparalleled user experiences, dramatically improved a host of innovative applications, and the emergence of various use cases has begun. To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}

abstract = {Fog computing allows the implementation of information processes on the native net, mainly because of its ability to process in real-time. On the other hand, the principles of Mist Computing have not been matured yet to be successfully adopted for daily use by communities. Research shows that it is possible to classify computational resources from computational paradigms, especially using multiple edge devices, so that they can perform cost-effective tasks using clustering software. However, the application of these solutions still faces several limitations in the resources that exist in the devices, including the diversity of the device and the mobility of IoT environments. Providing clustering methods for fog nodes can help address these issues. But, cooperation among things on the Internet of things faces many challenges in developing real-time applications. Mist computing infrastructure, located between the fog and the end nodes at the edge, In addition to intelligent offloading, can enable local decision-making with the help of sensors and actuators. It adopts appropriate layer-specific data transmission policies to ensure delay-tolerant data transmission of real-time information as well as big data. It can also help conserve bandwidth and battery power while single urgent information is transferred toward a server or router. Thus, collaborative clustering techniques can presumably be applied for IoT-mist. This requires a comprehensive study of clustering techniques and their applications in IoT-mist networks. In this paper, Our goal of this survey is, how collaborative clustering techniques in IoT-mist can improve network lifespan, optimize energy, and reduce delay in the network. We then review fog node clustering and how it allows more demanding applications to be processed in the mist layer, which in turn facilitates the fog of some tasks. Next, we discuss the challenges of applying clustering techniques on the IoT-mist network, and finally, we provide a conclusion and future works for this research.}
