abstract = {One of the most applied value scales in research is personal shopping value (PSV) by Babin, Darden, and Griffin (1994). PSV assesses consumers’ shopping experiences along hedonic and utilitarian value. The purpose of this research is the corroboration of the original article and the PSV scale to investigate the impact of the past 25 years on the scale’s dimensionality and item composition. The corroboration mirrors the original store environment, while an extension additionally considers two contemporary shopping environments: online websites and mobile apps. Results across six studies confirm shopping value’s two-dimensional structure of work and fun. However, individual items capturing hedonic and utilitarian value deviate from original PSV scale items in number and nature for current stores, online, and mobile apps environments. Researchers and practitioners should exhibit caution to blindly administer or adapt measures without considering temporal or contextual aspects of the scale that limit its applicability.}

abstract = {Background
Accurate situation awareness has been identified as a critical component of effective deteriorating patient response systems and an essential patient safety skill for nursing practice. However, situation awareness has been defined and theorised from multiple perspectives to explain how individuals, teams and systems maintain awareness in dynamic task environments.
Aim
Our aim was to critically analyse the different approaches taken to the study of situation awareness in healthcare and explore the implications for nursing practice and research as it relates to clinical deterioration in ward contexts.
Methods
We undertook a meta-narrative review of the healthcare literature to capture how situation awareness has been defined, theorised and studied in healthcare. Following an initial scoping review, we conducted an extensive search of ten electronic databases and included any theoretical, empirical or critical papers with a primary focus on situation awareness in an inpatient hospital setting. Included papers were collaboratively categorised in accordance with their theoretical framing, research tradition and paradigm with a narrative review presented.
Results
A total of 120 papers were included in this review. Three overarching narratives reflecting philosophical, patient safety and solution focussed framings of situation awareness and seven meta-narratives were identified as follows: individual, team and systems perspectives of situation awareness (meta-narratives 1–3), situation awareness and patient safety (meta-narrative 4), communication tools, technologies and education to support situation awareness (meta-narratives 5–7). We identified a concentration of literature from anaesthesia and operating rooms and a body of research largely located within a cognitive engineering tradition and a positivist research paradigm. Endsley's situation awareness model was applied in over 80% of the papers reviewed. A minority of papers drew on alternative situation awareness theories including constructivist, collaborative and distributed perspectives.
Conclusions
Nurses have a critical role in identifying and escalating the care of deteriorating patients. There is a need to build on prior studies and reflect on the reality of nurse's work and the constraints imposed on situation awareness by the demands of busy inpatient wards. We suggest that this will require an analysis that complements but goes beyond the dominant cognitive engineering tradition to reflect the complex socio-cultural reality of ward-based teams and to explore how situation awareness emerges in increasingly complex, technologically enabled distributed healthcare systems.}

Aging-caused changes, such as physical or cognitive decline, could affect people's quality of life, result in injuries, mental health or the lack of physical activity. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the most promising assistive technologies to support older people's daily life, which has enabled enormous potential in human-centred applications. Recent surveys in HAR either only focus on the deep learning approaches or one specific sensor modality. This survey aims to provide a more comprehensive introduction for newcomers and researchers to HAR. We first introduce the state-of-art sensor modalities in HAR. We look more into the techniques involved in each step of wearable sensor modality centred HAR in terms of sensors, activities, data pre-processing, feature learning and classification, including both conventional approaches and deep learning methods. In the feature learning section, we focus on both hand-crafted features and automatically learned features using deep networks. We also present the ambient-sensor-based HAR, including camera-based systems, and the systems which combine the wearable and ambient sensors. Finally, we identify the corresponding challenges in HAR to pose research problems for further improvement in HAR.}

abstract = {Human behavior inference through smart pervasive technologies is a new research avenue. Sophistication in interaction modalities with self-customization based on context makes interaction easier in natural settings. Despite greater sophistication, disabled and elderly person still face difficulties in interaction with smart devices. The interaction generally depends on two or more sensory channels simultaneously, which is a big concern for persons with impaired vision and hearing. Person with dual sensory loss face problem in interaction with smart devices. Interaction can be effectively possible with this population group using alternative tactile sensory channel and vibro-tactile stimuli could be a great alternative for communication in natural settings to accommodate their needs. Feature-rich handheld and wearable smart devices could be the cost-effective substitute for assisting in ADL in natural settings for disabled and elderly person. Religious worships are important part of human life. By exploiting the advanced sensing technologies in Smartphone, an assistive prayer model is developed which is aimed at assisting deafblind person in semi-isolated natural settings, in a cost-effective manner which emphasizes on utilization of alternative sensory channels of a human. The model is validated through an App SmartPrayerAid aimed to assist deafblind Muslim in offering Islamic worship Namaz in congregational setting. Comprehensive evaluation of the App was conducted to prove the validity of the model and the aptness of the smart devices for assisting disabled person in natural settings. The evaluation was conducted with deafblind, non-deafblind and non-disabled subjects in controlled lab environment. Results indicated that speech recognition was achieved between 77.76% in real environment, while up to 96.29% in controlled lab environment using online speech recognition in Arabic. Effectiveness of Vibro-tactile stimuli perception using Smartphone on different body parts was also evaluated and accuracy in detection observed on front pocket of shirt was 84.29%, front pocket of the trousers was 92.14% and on upper arm was 52.43% and on wrist of the right hand using Smartwatch was observed 97.62%. The model can be utilized in other natural settings in similar situations after slight modification to assist a deafblind person in performing ADL and other social activities.}

Within ICT, recommender systems are strong tools that filter relevant information, upgrading the relations between stakeholders in the polity and civil society, and assisting in decision making tasks through technological platforms. There are scientific articles covering recommendation approaches in smart city applications, and there are recommendation solutions implemented in real world smart city initiatives. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive review of the state of the art on recommender systems for smart cities. For this reason, in this paper we present a taxonomy of smart city features, dimensions, actions and goals, and, according to these variables, we survey the existing literature on recommender systems. As a result of our survey, we do not only identify and analyze main research trends, but also show current opportunities and challenges where personalized recommendations could be exploited as solutions for citizens, firms and public administrations.}

While IoT is still a growing and expanding platform, the current research in privacy and security shows there is little integration and unification of security and privacy that may affect user adoption of the technology because of fear of personal data exposure. The surveys conducted so far focus on vulnerabilities based on information exchange technologies applicable to the Internet. None of the surveys has brought out the integrated privacy and security perspective centered on the user. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader with a comprehensive discussion on the current state of the art of IoT, with particular focus on what have been done in the areas of privacy and security threats, attack surface, vulnerabilities and countermeasures and to propose a threat taxonomy. IoT user requirements and challenges were identified and discussed to highlight the baseline security and privacy needs and concerns of the user. The paper also proposed threat taxonomy to address the security requirements in broader perspective. This survey of IoT Privacy and Security has been undertaken through a systematic literature review using online databases and other resources to search for all articles that meet certain criteria, entering information about each study into a personal database, and then drawing up tables summarizing the current state of literature. As a result, the paper distills the latest developments in IoT privacy and security, highlights the open issues and identifies areas for further research.}

Our study aims at examining the adoption factors of social media and the impact of their use in managing disaster. We proposed and empirically validated a research model drawn on three combined theories: TAM, the diffusion-of-innovation theory and the Kahn’s framework of psychological conditions and agility. The obtained model was tested with a sample of 418 respondents using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling method (PLS-SEM). The study revealed the following two main outputs: (i) social media platforms are perceived to be easy to use, useful with a perceived relative advantage, and are therefore essential for disaster management; and (ii) the use of social media impacts information accessibility, adaptability, proactiveness and resilience.}

An outstanding problem concerns the social and organisational aspects of smart cities security resulting from competing interests of different parties, high levels of interdependence, and social and political complexity. Our review shows that current standards and guidelines have not clearly defined roles and responsibilities of different parties. A common understanding of key security requirements is not shared between different parties. This research assessed the smart cities and their cyber security measures, with a particular focus on technical standards and the regulatory framework.

Objective
Presented work highlights the development and initial validation of a medical embedded device for individualized care (MEDIC), which is based on a novel software architecture, enabling sensor management and disease prediction capabilities, and commercially available microelectronic components, sensors and conventional personal digital assistant (PDA) (or a cell phone).
Methods and materials
In this paper, we present a general architecture for a wearable sensor system that can be customized to an individual patient’s needs. This architecture is based on embedded artificial intelligence that permits autonomous operation, sensor management and inference, and may be applied to a general purpose wearable medical diagnostics.
Results
A prototype of the system has been developed based on a standard PDA and wireless sensor nodes equipped with commercially available Bluetooth radio components, permitting real-time streaming of high-bandwidth data from various physiological and contextual sensors. We also present the results of abnormal gait diagnosis using the complete system from our evaluation, and illustrate how the wearable system and its operation can be remotely configured and managed by either enterprise systems or medical personnel at centralized locations.
Conclusion
By using commercially available hardware components and software architecture presented in this paper, the MEDIC system can be rapidly configured, providing medical researchers with broadband sensor data from remote patients and platform access to best adapt operation for diagnostic operation objectives.}

By 2030, a 50% rise in lighting demand of the existing consumption is projected due to an increase in the global population. To address the concern of rising lighting electricity consumption, the key strategy is to develop and provide energy efficient lighting products to consumers. In this respect, the Solid-State Lighting (SSL) has the potential to offer power efficiencies that are superior to those of conventional lighting sources. Recently, white organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have emerged as the leading technology for the new display and lighting market which has attracted substantial attention of manufacturers, product designers, and end users. OLED devices have already entered into high end lighting markets such as designer, automotive, aerospace, high-end architectural lighting, and other applications. Moreover, innovative flexible OLED devices are thought to be candidates for the next-generation SSL systems, wearable electronics, mobile devices, microdisplays, etc. as they are lighter, thinner and more durable compared to glass (rigid) based devices. In the present review, distinctive features of OLEDs SSL lighting, technical requirements of lighting for applications, OLED basic, and classification of OLED devices, including quantum dot (QD) OLEDs (QLED) as well as the need of development of OLEDs standards are discussed. Various constituents of flexible OLED lighting, OLED lighting panels by some manufacturers, hurdles in OLED lighting technologies, performance of OLEDs in harsh conditions, challenges in flexible OLEDs, OLED lighting technology comparison, OLED lighting roadmap, and future directions including cost reduction analysis, flexible OLED incorporated into automotive, IoT (Internet of Things) connected lighting system, OLED market projections, etc. are also presented. It is suggested that the white OLEDs, and flexible OLEDs in particular, lighting products have potential to revolutionize the future of lighting systems, industries, and the market.}

abstract = {A significant bottleneck that hampers the adoption of many current technologies and wearable devices is power supply requirements. The quest to innovate portable self-powered systems has shed light on miniaturized energy harvesting devices called nanogenerators (NGs) that apply a wide variety of nanomaterials to achieve feasibility, flexibility, and enhanced electrical output. This systematic review provides a nearly complete list of all the NG devices present in the literature that have used carbon nanomaterials and harnessed renewable energy sources, namely mechanical, thermal, and fluid/blue energies, which were separately discussed and only deliberated to a certain limit with little demonstration of the materials and devices in previous publications. This review also draws attention to the overall aspects of carbon nanomaterial-based NGs, particularly in terms of electrical performance, and the role of carbon nanomaterials in how they have contributed to the advancement and application of energy harvesting devices, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, reduced graphene oxide, activated carbon, and graphitic carbon. Finally, the concluding section addresses the current challenges and provides an outlook on the potential future trends in energy harvesting.}

abstract = {The UK has set plans to increase offshore wind capacity from 22GW to 154GW by 2030. With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new ‘symbiotic digital architecture’ to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.}

abstract = {Remote sensing of night light emissions in the visible band offers a unique opportunity to directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development. The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal changes during the night (for example from a geostationary platform or constellation of satellites), and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission (roughly analogous to the BRDF in daylight sensing). Perhaps most importantly, we make the case that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions, and monitor energy use.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

abstract = {A system is context-aware if it can extract, interpret and use context information and adapt its functionality to the current context of use. Multi-agent planning generalizes the problem of planning in domains where several agents plan and act together, and share resources, activities, and goals. This contribution presents a practical extension of a formal theoretical model for Context-Aware Multi-Agent Planning based upon an argumentation-based defeasible logic. Our framework, named CAMAP, is implemented on a platform for open multi-agent systems and has been experimentally tested, among others, in applications of ambient intelligence in the field of health-care. CAMAP is based on a multi-agent partial-order planning paradigm in which agents have diverse abilities, use an argumentation-based defeasible contextual reasoning to support their own beliefs and refute the beliefs of the others according to their context knowledge during the plan search process. CAMAP shows to be an adequate approach to tackle ambient intelligence problems as it gathers together in a single framework the ability of planning while it allows agents to put forward arguments that support or argue upon the accuracy, unambiguity and reliability of the context-aware information.}

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}

abstract = {Fog computing allows the implementation of information processes on the native net, mainly because of its ability to process in real-time. On the other hand, the principles of Mist Computing have not been matured yet to be successfully adopted for daily use by communities. Research shows that it is possible to classify computational resources from computational paradigms, especially using multiple edge devices, so that they can perform cost-effective tasks using clustering software. However, the application of these solutions still faces several limitations in the resources that exist in the devices, including the diversity of the device and the mobility of IoT environments. Providing clustering methods for fog nodes can help address these issues. But, cooperation among things on the Internet of things faces many challenges in developing real-time applications. Mist computing infrastructure, located between the fog and the end nodes at the edge, In addition to intelligent offloading, can enable local decision-making with the help of sensors and actuators. It adopts appropriate layer-specific data transmission policies to ensure delay-tolerant data transmission of real-time information as well as big data. It can also help conserve bandwidth and battery power while single urgent information is transferred toward a server or router. Thus, collaborative clustering techniques can presumably be applied for IoT-mist. This requires a comprehensive study of clustering techniques and their applications in IoT-mist networks. In this paper, Our goal of this survey is, how collaborative clustering techniques in IoT-mist can improve network lifespan, optimize energy, and reduce delay in the network. We then review fog node clustering and how it allows more demanding applications to be processed in the mist layer, which in turn facilitates the fog of some tasks. Next, we discuss the challenges of applying clustering techniques on the IoT-mist network, and finally, we provide a conclusion and future works for this research.}
