abstract = {Extended-release naltrexone (XRNTX) is an effective treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We sought to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of XRNTX delivered as a stand-alone service to persons with severe AUD who are high utilizers of multiple urgent and emergency medical services (HUMS). Of 15 HUMS persons with severe AUD selected based on chart review, 11 agreed to participate. Participants received a mean of 4.5 injections (range 2–7). Modest benefits from XRNTX were observed in terms of patients' Urge-to-Drink Score and the costs of emergency medical services utilized. Though limited by a small sample size, costs including client utilization and study related expenses during the post-enrollment period were less than client utilization costs in the pre-enrollment period. We also observed non-significant improvements in the number of drinking days, but no change in quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D. Eighty-eight percent of participants perceived XRNTX as helping with their drinking. Findings need to be replicated in a larger study, however if replicated, the cost savings could be substantial.}

This study assesses the impact of smoke-free legislation on the incidence rate for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke in Shenzhen.
Methods
Data on ischemic (n = 72,945) and hemorrhagic (n = 18,659) stroke and AMI (n = 17,431) incidence covering about 12 million people in Shenzhen from 2012 to 2016 were used. Immediate and gradual changes in incidence rates were analyzed using segmented Poisson regression.
Results
Following the smoke-free legislation, a 9% (95% CI: 3%–15%) immediate reduction was observed in AMI incidence, especially in men (8%, 95% CI: 1%–14%) and in those aged 65 years and older (17%, 95% CI: 9%–25%). The gradual annual benefits were observed only in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke incidence, with a 7% (95% CI: 2%–11%) and 6% (95% CI: 4%–8%) decrease per year, respectively. This health effect extended gradually to the 50–64 age group. In addition, neither the immediate nor gradual decrease in stroke and AMI incidence rates did not show statistical significance among the 35–49 age group (P > 0.05).
Conclusion
Smoke-free legislation was enforced well in Shenzhen, which would generate good experiences for other cities to enact and enforce smoke-free laws. This study also provided more evidence of the health benefits of smoke-free laws on stroke and AMI.}

(MS), M. rotundifolia (Roxb.) Kuntze (MR), M. diversifolia (Wall. ex G. Don) Havil. (MD), and M. hirsuta Havil. (MH), occur in Thailand. M. speciosa, commonly known as ‘Kratom’ in Thai, is the only narcotic species for which buying, selling, importing or possessing has been prohibited by law in Thailand and some other countries. Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, the major psychoactive compounds, are important in the treatment of opioid withdrawal. However, this species is used in traditional medicine to relieve pain and inflammation. Consequently, a rapid and easy technique for differentiating M. speciosa from closely related species is needed for routine forensic analysis. In this study, polymerase chain reaction coupled with lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (PCR-LFA) based on matK was developed for the detection of M. speciosa in forensic specimens. Duplex primers (MS-F-FAM, Ctrl-F-DIG and Ctrl-R-Biotin) were designed based on species-specific nucleotide indels observed exclusively in the matK sequences of M. speciosa. Positive results for M. speciosa are indicated by the clear presence of three black lines on the lateral flow cassette. Forensic samples were investigated, and the three black test lines indicating M. speciosa were observed for seven of eight specimens. PCR-LFA has been proven to be fast, easy and efficient for detecting the narcotic M. speciosa and could be developed as a rapid forensic diagnostic technique for other plants.}

More data can be gathered from the crisis site, arriving in a large flow of various types from multiple sources such as sensors, open data, or social media. This huge amount of data coming continuously from the crisis site leads to an ever-changing situational awareness that must be built and understood as quickly as it is evolving to ensure a relevant and effective crisis response. To build a shared situational awareness, decision-makers can gather in a room where they can share and compare the information they receive from the crisis site to build a common operational picture that they can use to make decisions and implement them: this is a crisis management cell. However, the tools in traditional crisis management cells may not be able to keep up with the new requirements induced by these changes: we need modular and dynamic tools able to adapt to the crisis and the needs of the crisis managers while ensuring collaboration and information sharing not only between the stakeholders but also with remote experts that might be needed to understand the situation. We need to start conceiving the future crisis management cell that would meet the new exigencies of crisis management. This paper proposes our version of that future crisis management cell, using virtual reality to provide a dynamic and modular crisis management cell linked to artificial intelligence and decision-support systems.}

abstract = {Buprenorphine induction for treating opioid use disorder is being implemented in emergency care. During this era of high-potency synthetic opioid use, novel and divergent algorithms for buprenorphine induction are emerging to optimize induction experience, facilitating continued treatment. Specifically, in patients with chronic fentanyl or other drug exposures, some clinicians are using alternative buprenorphine induction strategies, such as quickly maximizing buprenorphine agonist effects (eg, macrodosing) or, conversely, giving smaller initial doses and slowing the rate of buprenorphine dosing to avoid antagonist/withdrawal effects (eg, microdosing). However, there is a lack of foundational theory and empirical data to guide clinicians in evaluating such novel induction strategies. We present data from clinical studies of buprenorphine induction and propose a neuropharmacologic working model, which posits that acute clinical success of buprenorphine induction (achieving a positive agonist-to-withdrawal balance) is a nonlinear outcome of the opioid balance at the time of initial buprenorphine dose and mu-opioid–receptor affinity, lipophilicity, and mu-opioid–receptor intrinsic efficacy (the “ALE value”) of the prior opioid. We discuss the rationale for administering smaller or larger doses of buprenorphine to optimize the patient induction experience during common clinical situations.}

We propose a method consisting of three algorithms: a distributed path planner to obtain communication-aware trajectories; a deployment planner providing dual-use of the robots, visiting primary goals and performing connectivity tasks; and a clustering algorithm to allocate the tasks to robots, and obtain the best goal visit order for the mission.}

abstract = {Objectives
Adderall (amphetamine-dextroamphetamine) is a controlled substance with harmful adverse effects if abused or misused. We assessed the availability of Adderall from common search engines, and evaluated the safety and marketing characteristics of online pharmacies selling Adderall.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting and participants
From December 2019 to February 2020, the phrase “buy Adderall online” was queried in four search engines: Google (N = 100), Bing (N = 100), Yahoo (N = 50) and DuckDuckGo (N = 50). Online pharmacies that claimed to sell Adderall and had unique Uniform Resource Locators, were active, free-access, and in English language were included.
Outcome measures
Online pharmacies were categorized as rogue, unclassified, or legitimate on the basis of LegitScript classifications. Safety and marketing characteristics, and costs were collected.
Results
Of the 62 online pharmacies found to sell Adderall, 61 were rogue or unclassified. Across all rogue and unclassified online pharmacies, prescriptions were not required (100%), pharmacist services were not offered (100%), and quantity limits were not placed on the number of Adderall purchases (100%). Rogue and unclassified online pharmacies appealed to cost, offering price discounts (61%), bulk discounts (67%), and coupon codes (70%). Contrary to their claims, cheaper prices were available for all formulations and dosages of Adderall from GoodRx than from these online pharmacies. Rogue and unclassified online pharmacies promoted and enabled the illicit purchase of Adderall, appealing to privacy (74%), offering purchase through cryptocurrency (74%), and claiming registration or accreditation of their sites (33%).
Conclusion
Rogue online pharmacies are pervasive in search engine results, enabling the illicit purchase of Adderall without a prescription. Consumers are at risk of purchasing Adderall, a medication with high abuse potential, from unsafe sources. Law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and search engines should work to further protect consumers from unregistered and illegitimate online pharmacies selling Adderall.}

In this study, location analysis of emergency system vehicles is discussed using an approximate queueing model (AQM) on fully connected networks. We relax single vehicle restriction in each vehicle location which is commonly employed in the literature. Order of districting structure is used to transition rates in AQM. Service rates are computed regarding the location of the demand call and the vehicle, which provides higher resolution than inter-intra district service rates. Generic rate formulations are delivered for service rate calculations. A coverage threshold is used and all location solutions for a problem instance having a higher coverage than the threshold are analyzed. Mean response time for these solutions are found using AQM and an exact simulation model. Mean absolute percent error for mean response time is reported against different order of districting levels and network specific variables such as distribution of demand over the area, traffic intensity or the number of vehicles.}

Whilst research at the site of news content (e.g. newspaper articles) has proliferated, there is little understanding about the site of news production (i.e. the role that powerful actors play in shaping news content). Here, both news content (via newspaper articles) and news production (via image collections) are examined together to seek to understand how climate protest has been visually represented. This study focuses on the period between 2019 and 2020, a time of significant growth for climate protest through the expansion of movements including Extinction Rebellion and Fridays For Future. Historically, protest is often represented in the media through the ‘protest paradigm’, with protestors depicted as socially deviant. This study sought to examine if this paradigm held true for these most recent protests. Climate protest imagery was collected from a globally-dominant image collection, Getty Images; and from the digital archives of five major UK newspapers. Secondary analysis was also undertaken of a longitudinal visual media datasource featuring three of the same UK newspapers from 2001 to 2009. The study shows that in 2001–2009, climate protest was typically visualised in a way which obscured the human face of protest and was consistent with the protest paradigm. In contrast, in 2019–20, protesters – and particularly school strikers – were depicted in an individualised, powerful, and hopeful way. The dominant face of climate protest in 2019–20 is visually represented in the media as young and female. We conclude that the visual discourse of climate protest has shifted away from the protest paradigm to instead depict climate change as an issue of intergenerational equity.}

Mass casualty incidents can be devastating events associated with a large number of fatalities, morbidities, and long-lasting sequelae. The negative outcomes can be further amplified if the incident occurred during a pandemic surge, such as what occurred in Beirut, Lebanon with the August 4, 2020 Beirut Port explosion. To decrease the mortality and morbidity and avoid inefficiency, management depends on having an established coordinated multidisciplinary approach from transport and triage to emergency department care and in-hospital management.

Numerous barriers exist to providing MOUD within the criminal justice system and/or to justice-involved populations. The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature on implementation of MOUD within criminal justice settings and with justice-involved populations. Methods: A systematic search process identified 53 papers that addressed issues pertaining to implementation barriers or facilitators of MOUD within correctional settings or with justice-involved populations; these were coded and qualitatively analyzed for common themes. Results: Over half of the papers were published outside of the U.S. (n = 28); the most common study designs were surveys or structured interviews (n = 20) and qualitative interviews/focus groups (n = 18) conducted with correctional or treatment staff and with incarcerated individuals. Four categories of barriers and facilitators were identified: institutional, programmatic, attitudinal, and systemic. Institutional barriers typically limited capacity to provide MOUD to justice-involved individuals, which led to programmatic practices in which MOUD was not implemented following clinical guidelines, often resulting in forcible withdrawal or inadequate treatment. These programmatic practices commonly led to aversive experiences among justice-involved individuals, who consequently espoused negative attitudes about MOUD and were reluctant to seek treatment with MOUD following their release to the community. Facilitators of MOUD implementation included increased knowledge and information from training interventions and favorable prior experiences with individuals being treated with MOUD among correctional and treatment staff. Few systemic facilitators to implementing MOUD with justice-involved individuals were evident in the literature. Conclusion: Barriers to implementing MOUD in criminal justice settings and/or with justice-involved populations are pervasive, multi-leveled, and inter-dependent. More work is needed on facilitators of MOUD implementation.}

This resulted in the evaluation of 67 relevant journal articles collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The review revealed that ImTs have been applied for OSH training and education in various industries including transportation, construction, mining, and healthcare. It was also revealed that the OSH hazards addressed by ImT-based training and education include but are not limited to fire, fall, electrical and chemical hazards in order to prevent or reduce injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition, it was revealed that one of the benefits of ImTs for OSH training and education is better retention of concepts when compared to conventional training and education. Challenges associated with the use of ImTs for OSH training and education include insufficient display brightness for users to effectively see virtual objects in a brightly luminated environment. Among the recommendations for future work is research into how to develop effective communication methods between trainers and trainees immersed in a virtual environment for trainers to fully understand the difficulties trainees experience in operating the developed ImT-based platform and provide solutions to such difficulties.}

A-600 portable X-ray imaging system (Vidisco Inc.) was used as the experiment equipment. The imaging relation among the ray-source, video camera unit (VCU) and control display unit (CDU) was studied by using geometric formations to avoid shooting mistakes. The optimum shooting distance, angle and pulse parameters for simulated suitcase IED were determined in a closed environment under normal conditions. With the determined parameters, X-ray images were taken from three main directions to obtain a 2-dimension image of a 3-dimension substance. With the shootings from these main directions, the images taken onto the VCU were determined as square, rectangular and hexagonal. The picture enhancement techniques were also determined to avoid the blurring, enlargement and penumbra shadow on the images taken. It was concluded that the proper images of simulated IED placed in a suitcase were taken with 150cm distance, 99 pulse and 90° main and 45°/135° supporting side angles.}

A huge number of review research studies have been published that review previous IoT related research and more recent advances in a wide number of different IoT technologies and applications. However, as yet, there has not been any meta-review conducted to comprehensively analyze all current IoT review publications. The main objective of this survey is to present the research community with an overview and analysis of IoT review studies that have been published so far, and what challenges still remain that need to be addressed in this field. This paper also attempts to report the enabling factors that were identified, as well as the weaknesses and the risk factors in the current published survey papers. First, IoT review publications were classified into eight categories: IoT applications, types, security, data, communication networks, development, protocol standards, and technologies. Second, the bibliometric indicators were used to identify the leading trends in the IoT field. Third, a graphical/spatial mapping of the bibliographic material, journals and author co-citation networks, the bibliometric coupling of countries, and the co-occurrence of keyword network maps were developed from the IoT reviews. The results indicate that IoT applications, technologies, and security categories had the highest number of publications, whereas the IoT data and network categories had the lowest amount of publications, each of them had less than 5.5% of the total. The USA had the highest h-index at 56, the leading country in this field.}

abstract = {Background
Sex and prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) are known independent prognostic factors following an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We aimed to examine whether the association between sex and 30-day mortality differ according to the presence of previous CVD in STEMI patients.
Methods
Prospective, observational, multicentre registry of consecutive patients managed in 17 STEMI networks in Spain (83 centres), between April and June 2019. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models assessed the association of 30-day mortality with sex and prior CVD status, as well as their interaction.
Results
Among 4366 patients (mean age 63.7 ± 13.0 years; 78% male), there were 337 (8.1%) deaths within the first 30 days. There was an association between crude 30-day mortality and sex (women 10.4% vs. men 7.4%, p = 0.003), and prior CVD (CVD 13.7% vs non-CVD 6.8%, p < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounding, neither sex nor prior CVD were apparently associated with mortality. Nevertheless, we found a significant sex-CVD interaction (p-interaction = 0.006), since women were at lower risk than men in the subset of patients with prior CVD (OR = 0.30, 95%CI = 0.12–0.80) but not in those without CVD (OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 0.79–1.74).
Conclusions
Women as well as patients with prior CVD have an increased crude risk of 30-day mortality. However, sex-related differences in short term mortality are modulated by the interaction with CVD in STEMI patients. Compared to men, women had a similar prognosis in the subset of patients without CVD, whereas they were associated with a lower risk of mortality among those with prior CVD after adjusting for other prognostic factors.}

We thus present a multiobjective integer programming model, incorporating both equity and overall survival rates, to help decision-makers select BLS companies in a jurisdiction to equip with AEDs. The model can also accommodate restrictions that decision-makers might wish to impose in terms of specifying BLS units on which an AED must, or must not, be placed. In addition to the model itself, a heuristic solution procedure is presented. A case study in which the model was applied successfully is also described.}

abstract = {In recent years, emotional contagion has drawn great attention in the field of public security since it often leads to stampedes and crushes during large-scale emergencies. To date, there have been many studies on emotional contagion in both cyberspace and physical space, bringing a strong impetus to the simulation of crowd evacuation in emergencies. However, due to the heterogeneity of crowds in cyberspace and physical space, emotional contagion is rarely comprehensively considered in the cyber-physical society (CPS). In addition, the characteristics of emotional recurrence prone to appear in large-scale evacuation have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, the existing models cannot accurately describe the real situation of emotional contagion since there is a wide deviation between it and the reality. To solve this problem, we propose a recurrent emotional contagion (REC) method for crowd evacuation of the CPS. First, we construct a CPS-oriented REC model by considering the influence of emotional recurrence on the emotional contagion process. Second, we build the degree-based Mean-Field Equations to describe the dynamic evolution of the number of individuals while considering the heterogeneity of crowds. Furthermore, we use the Finite Difference Method to derive the numerical solution. Third, we construct recurrent small-world networks, which constitute a special case of CPS-REC, to verify the effectiveness of our model. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system based on the CPS-REC model to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that our method can more realistically simulate the emotional contagion process.}

The recent availability of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, provides new opportunities for treatment and prevention, but little is known about patient preferences. We conducted qualitative analysis using focus groups (FG) of PWID recruited based on OAT experience: currently, previously, and never on OAT in five Ukrainian cities. FG included 199 PWID in 25 focus groups. Focus group transcripts were coded and analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach to identify common themes and domains related to attitudes about and preferences for XR-NTX, relative to other treatments. Interest in XR-NTX was supported if supervised opioid withdrawal and psychological support were assured. Other factors supporting XR-NTX included a focus on younger PWID early in their injection career and motivated for recovery. Perceptions of recovery included not receiving psychoactive medications like methadone or buprenorphine. With more information, XR-NTX could be a viable option for PWID in Ukraine, especially if concerns regarding withdrawal and psychological support are adequately addressed.}

The policy consistency from up to down in a big country lays a solid foundation for sustainable recycling. However, quantitative comparison or evaluation of power batteries recycling policies (PBRPs) from various levels of government is insufficient in the existing literature. In this paper, text mining technology and the Policy Modelling Consistency Index (PMC-Index) model are used to evaluate the longitudinal and horizontal consistency level of China's 13 central PBRPs as well as 25 local PBRPs from 2016 to 2022. The findings demonstrated that: (1) Longitudinally, the local governments present a high consistency level with the central government in the objective and content of PBRPs via comparison analysis of high-frequency words, which embodies the local governments firmly advocating the national strategy for retired battery recycling. (2) Horizontally, the number of central PBRPs with excellent and good consistency is five and seven, respectively, while the number of local PBRPs with excellent and good consistency is six and seven, respectively. One central and twelve local PBRPs are of acceptable consistency, indicating significant disparity in local governments' policymaking ability. (3)The drawbacks of those acceptable policies attribute to the policy tendency of traceability management, policy timeliness, policy content in terms of incentives and business recycling model. Finally, management implications were summarized to optimize China's PBRPs system and PBR performance based on the empirical result, an overview of PBRPs and recycling practices in developed countries.}

Unchecked hypomanic symptoms may include risky behaviors, through which a patient could sustain irreparable damage to relationships, careers, and finances. Sometimes, patients are familiar enough with bipolar illness that they may anticipate or interpret inquiry regarding hypomanic symptomology (Goodwin & Jamison, 1990). Applying their own stigmas to bipolar illness, such patients may only admit to depressive symptoms to avoid a bipolar diagnosis (Goodwin & Jamison, 1990). Also, hypomanic symptoms can be nuanced and difficult to detect in patients who may misinterpret the elevated mood state as a return to good mental health rather than the pathologic condition it is. These and other factors, such as poor memory, substance use, physical problems, and co-morbid mental illnesses, contribute to the misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of bipolar II disorder for many patients (APA, 2013; Goodwin & Jamison, 1990). The astute clinician, however, can bypass the cascade of events leading up to the poor outcomes associated with unrecognized and mistreated hypomanic symptoms by committing to due diligence when assessing mood symptoms, depressed and elevated.}

The specimen, calibrator and control preparation involved hydrolysis of conjugated benzodiazepines using β-glucuronidase in sodium acetate buffer, with incubation at 60°C for 2h. Specimens were then centrifuged, before being diluted 1 in 5 (total dilution 1 in 10), with 10% acetonitrile in water. Specimens were analysed using a Shimadzu Prominence UPLC coupled to an AB Sciex 4000 QTrap LC–MS-MS. The chromatographic column was a Shim-pack XR ODS 2.2μm. 3.0×50mm column and the mobile phase was a binary gradient system comprising of mobile phase A which was an ammonium formate/formic acid buffer dissolved in water and mobile phase B which was an ammonium formate/formic acid buffer dissolved in Acetonitrile. APCI was selected as the ionisation technique and the MS was operated in MRM mode, monitoring 2 transitions per analyte. The validation of the method is described. The method was found to be linear, accurate and precise (within day and between day) for diazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, nordiazepam, desalkylflurazepam, alprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. The results of 480 cases are reviewed and show that alprazolam use was found in 35% of cases. Use of benzodiazepines resulting in oxazepam, nordiazepam or temazepam were found ca. 70% of cases analysed.}

Localization capabilities represent fundamental supports in emergency situations. Although localization has been largely investigated in the field of mobile robotics and produced a large variety of applications, in emergency response scenarios it still remain a challenge, due to the demanding operating conditions. In this contribution, an indoor localization framework for rescue teams is presented. The peculiarity of the proposed system relies on the integration between human operators and robots. Moreover, a network composed by RFID tags is used to structure the environment and to reduce positioning uncertainties. The paper represents a preliminary study and presents mainly a conceptual architecture for rescue localization.}

abstract = {Reliable, selective and sensitive approaches for trinitrophenol (TNP) detection are highly desirable with respect to national security and environmental protection. Herein, a simple and novel fluorescent strategy for highly sensitive and specific TNP assay has been successfully developed, which is based on the quenching of the fluorescent poly(thymine)-templated copper nanoclusters (DNA-CuNCs), through the synergetic effects of acid induction and electron transfer. Upon the addition of TNP, donor-acceptor complexes between the electron-deficient nitro-groups in TNP and the electron-donating DNA templates are formed, resulting in the close proximity between TNP and CuNCs. Moreover, the acidity of TNP contributes to the pH decrease of the system. These factors combine to dramatically quench the fluorescence of DNA-CuNCs, providing a “signal-off” strategy for TNP sensing. The as-proposed strategy demonstrates high sensitivity for TNP assay, and a detection limit of 0.03μM is obtained, which is lower than those reported by using organic fluorescent materials. More significantly, this approach shows outstanding selectivity over a number of TNP analogues, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), 3-nitrophenol (NP), nitrobenzene (NB), phenol (BP), and toluene (BT). Compared with previous studies, this method does not need complex DNA sequence design, fluorescent dye labeling, or sophisticated organic reactions, rendering the strategy with additional advantages of simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the as-proposed strategy has been adopted for the detection of TNP in natural water samples, indicating its great potential to be applied in the fields of public safety and environmental monitoring.}

The XR device, which is at the core of this method, supports an interactive environment using a holographic overlay of graphical information on the spatial environment and physical objects being inspected. By leveraging this capability, a novel XR-supported inspection pipeline, called eXtended Reality-based Inspection and Visualization (XRIV), is developed. Key tasks supported by this method include detecting visual damage from sensory data acquired by the XR device, estimating its size, and visualizing (overlaying) information on the spatial environment. The crucial step of real-time interactive segmentation—detection and pixel-wise damage boundary refinement—is achieved using a feature Back-propagating Refinement Scheme (f-BRS) algorithm. Then, a ray-casting algorithm is applied to back-project the 2D image pixel coordinates of the damage region to their 3D world coordinates for damage area quantification in real-world (physical) units. Finally, the area information is overlaid and anchored to the scene containing damage for visualization and documentation. The performance of XRIV is experimentally demonstrated by measuring surface structural damage of an in-service concrete bridge with less than 10% errors for two different test cases, and image processing latency of 2–3 s (or 0.5 s per seed point) from f-BRS. The proposed XRIV pipeline underscores the advantages of real-time interaction between expert users and the XR device through immersive visualization so that a human–machine collaborative workflow can be established to obtain better inspection outcomes in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

However, these resources do need to be carefully constructed and grounded in pedagogic theory to be effective. This article details eXtended Reality (XR) learning and teaching environments to facilitate effective online teaching and learning for forensic geoscientists. The first two case studies discussed in this article make use of Thinglink software to produce virtual learning and teaching XR resources through an internet system, which was delivered to undergraduate students in 2021. Case one details a range of XR virtual laboratory-based equipment resources, providing a consistent, reliable and asynchronous learning and teaching experience, whilst the second case study presents an XR virtual learning applied geophysics resource developed for a 12-week CPD training programme. This programme involves recorded equipment video resources, accompanying datasets and worksheets for users to work through. Both case studies were positively received by learners, but there were issues encountered by learners with poor internet connections or computer skills, or who do not engage well with online learning. A third case study showcases an XR educational forensic geoscience eGame that was developed to take the user through a cold case search investigation, from desktop study through to field reconnaissance and multi-staged site investigations. Pedagogic research was undertaken with user questionnaires and interviews, providing evidence that the eGame was an effective learning and teaching tool. eGame users highly rated the eGame and reported that they raised awareness and understanding of the use of geophysics equipment and best practice of forensic geoscience search phased investigations. These types of XR virtual learning digital resources, whilst costly to produce in terms of development time and staff resource, provide a complementary virtual learning experience to in-situ practical sessions, and allow learners to asynchronously familiarise themselves with equipment, environments and techniques resulting in more efficient use of in situ time. The XR resources also allow learners to reinforce learning post in-situ sessions. Finally, XR resources can provide a more inclusive and authentic experience for learners who cannot attend or complete work synchronously.}

We evaluated the relationship between XR-NTX adherence and criminal recidivism (re-arrest and re-incarceration) and opioid and cocaine use. Twenty-seven pre-release male and female prisoners who had opioid disorders during the year prior to index incarceration were recruited and received one XR-NTX injection once each month for 7months (1 injection pre-release from prison and 6 injections in the community) and of those 27, 10 (37%) were retained in treatment at 7-months post release. Results indicate those completing 6 compared to those completing <6 injections were less likely to test positive for opioids in the community (0% vs. 62.5%, respectively; p=0.003). Although not statistically significant, individuals who did not complete all 6 injections were more likely to be re-arrested compared to those completing all 6 community injections (31.3% vs. 0%, respectively; p=0.123). Contingent upon further study of a randomized controlled trial, XR-NTX may be a feasible option in the prison setting in view of the lack of potential for diversion. Furthermore, these data suggest that completing the entire course of treatment (6 injections) may reduce opioid use and, to a lesser degree, re-arrest and re-incarceration.}

abstract = {Background
Buprenorphine can be effective in a variety of community substance use treatment settings outside of methadone programs, including outpatient programs and medical practices. In these settings, it has been found to be effective in reducing opioid use and retaining patients in treatment. Despite its effectiveness and safety, it is rarely provided to individuals with opioid use disorders in probation and parole settings.
Methods
Male and female individuals under probation or parole supervision (N = 320) with histories of opioid use disorder will be enrolled in this randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms: Buprenorphine Bridge Treatment (BBT): Participants will begin buprenorphine using the MedicaSafe dispensing device immediately after an on-site intake at a community supervision office and continue such treatment until they are transitioned to a community program; or Treatment as Usual (TAU): Participants will receive a referral to buprenorphine pharmacotherapy treatment in the community. Treatment outcomes will be: (a) illicit opioid oral saliva drug test results; and (b) treatment adherence (i. entered community based treatment; ii. number of days receiving opioid treatment).
Results
We describe the background and rationale for the study, its aims, hypotheses, and study design.
Conclusions
If shown to increase compliance rates with conditions of probation and parole, buprenorphine treatment co-located at community supervision field offices could have a major impact on delivery of buprenorphine treatment to the criminal justice population. The public health impact of the proposed study would be widespread because this intervention could be implemented throughout areas of the US.}

abstract = {During ship emergencies, a reliable and efficient evacuation system is able to guide passengers to the appropriate muster stations as quickly as possible. The majority of the existing indoor evacuation systems provide emergency guidance for people trapped in general buildings. However, those systems fail to consider the unique challenges of ship passenger evacuation, such as the effect of ship motion on pedestrian motion and the feedback of pedestrian motion on ship inclination state. Consequently, evacuation guidance provided by these schemes may not always be optimal or may even make the evacuation worse due to the differences in the critical factors influencing emergency guiding between land-based buildings and passenger ships. This paper presents a systematic literature overview of recent advances in building evacuation, followed by a description of the challenges unique to evacuating passengers on vessels. Furthermore, the existing ship evacuation research is reviewed from three aspects, i.e., passenger behavior study, ship evacuation optimization, and evaluation of evacuation on passenger ships. A discussion of land-based evacuation schemes and prospects for ship evacuation is also presented.}

keywords = {Price, Purity, Purity-adjusted price, Affordability, Heroin, Cocaine, Europe},
abstract = {Background
The importance of illicit drug price data and making appropriate adjustments for purity has been repeatedly highlighted for understanding illicit drug markets. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has been collecting retail price data for a number of drug types alongside drug-specific purity information for over 15 years. While these data are useful for a number of monitoring and analytical purposes, they are not without their limitations and there are circumstances where additional adjustment needs to be considered. This paper reviews some conceptual issues and measurement challenges relevant to the interpretation of price data. It also highlights the issues with between-country comparisons of drug prices and introduces the concept of affordability of drugs, going beyond purity-adjustment to account for varying national economies.
Methods
Based on a 2015 European data set of price and purity data across the heroin and cocaine retail markets, the paper demonstrates a new model for drug market comparative analysis; calculation of drug affordability is achieved by applying to purity-adjusted prices 2015 Price Level Indices (PLI, Eurostat).
Results
Available data allowed retail heroin and cocaine market comparison for 27 European countries. The lowest and highest unadjusted prices per gram were observed for heroin: in Estonia, Belgium, Greece and Bulgaria (lowest) and Finland, Ireland, Sweden and Latvia (highest); for cocaine: the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom (lowest) and Turkey, Finland, Estonia and Romania (highest). The affordability per gram of heroin and cocaine when taking into account adjustment for both purity and economy demonstrates different patterns.
Conclusion
It is argued that purity-adjusted price alone provides an incomplete comparison of retail price across countries. The proposed new method takes account of the differing economic conditions within European countries, thus providing a more sophisticated tool for cross-national comparisons of retail drug markets in Europe. Future work will need to examine other potential uses of the drug affordability tool.
Limitations
The limitations of this measure reflect primarily the limitations of the constituent data; in addition to issues inherent in collecting accurate data on illicit markets, analysis that relies on data collected from multiple countries is susceptible to discrepancies in data collection practices from country to country.}

A radiolabeled probe (14-carbon sodium dodecyl sulfate (14C-SDS)) was used to trace the penetration of a model anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), into excised human skin and into an inert membrane composite in vitro. SDS dose varied from 0.03 to 15 mg/cm2, mimicking the exposure of a rinse-off cleanser on skin. Two surfactant exposure lengths were tested, 2 min and 5 h. SDS penetration into excised human skin was constant from 50 to 600 mM for skin samples exposed to SDS for 2 min. For skin samples exposed to SDS for 5 h, SDS penetration into skin increased log-linearly with increasing SDS concentration. SDS penetration into the inert membrane composite was constant from 50 to 600 mM SDS regardless of length of surfactant exposure. Penetration of the radiolabeled probe into skin and into the inert membrane correlated well with the monomeric concentration of the radiolabeled probe in the applied surfactant solution. These results support that monomer concentration is the driving force for initial SDS penetration into upper layers of the stratum corneum over a wide range of concentrations. With prolonged exposure, SDS penetrates the skin in a dose-dependent manner due to surfactant-induced damage to the skin.}

Patient navigation has potential for assisting patients who initiate methadone during pretrial detention to enter and remain in treatment following release, but we know little about participants' experiences with this service.
Methods
This study drew a purposive sample of male and female participants (N = 17) from participants enrolled in a randomized trial of initiating methadone with vs. without patient navigation while in the Baltimore City Detention Center. The study interviewed participants in the community at 1 and 3 months following release and asked them about their experiences of reentry, methadone treatment continuation, drug use, and interactions with the patient navigator. The study recorded, transcribed, coded using Atlas.ti, and analyzed thematically the interviews.
Results
Participants reported encountering four key challenges in the community: getting to treatment following release, assembling basic supports, managing criminal justice system demands, and staying in treatment. Participants' experiences of the patient navigator's support to address these challenges fell into six thematic groups: showing nonjudgmental caring and persistence, advocating within programs, brokering resources, managing interactions with the criminal justice system, balancing encouragement and self-determination, and offering genuine and familial-type support.
Conclusion
Nearly all participants appreciated the navigator's support and deemed it helpful. The previously reported randomized trial found that participants assigned to initiate methadone treatment with navigation had higher rates of receiving their first “guest” methadone dose in the community but did not have significantly different rates of treatment enrollment or of illicit opioid use compared to those assigned to begin methadone treatment without navigation. Treatment programs should work to improve retention and postrelease outcomes among this population.}

Age-invariant face recognition (AIFR) models find applicability in several real time applications such as criminal identification, missing person detection, and so on. The main issue is the high intra-personal disparities because of complicated and non-linear age progression process. An essential component of face recognition model is the extraction of important features from the facial images for reducing intrapersonal differences produced by illumination, expression, pose, age, etc. The recent advances of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models pave a way for effective design of AIFR models. In this view, this study presents a new Bald Eagle Search Optimization with Deep Transfer Learning Enabled AFIR (BESDTL-AIFR) model. The presented BESDTL-AIFR model primarily pre-processes the facial images to enhance the quality. Besides, the BESDTL-AIFR model utilizes Inception v3 model for learning high level deep features. Next, these features are passed into the optimal deep belief network (DBN) model for face recognition. Finally, the hyperparameters of the DBN model are optimally chosen by the use of BES algorithm. Experimentation analysis on challenging benchmark datasets pointed out the promising outcomes of the BESDTL-AIFR model compared to recent approaches.}

The current study is a formative qualitative evaluation of the implementation of a cross-system (corrections and community-based) opioid use treatment initiative supported by Opioid State Targeted Response (STR) funding. The purpose of the study is to assess the fit of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to a cross-system initiative, and to identify key barriers and facilitators to implementation. The process evaluation showed that adaptability of the clinical model and staff flexibility were critical to implementation. Cultural and procedural differences across correctional facilities and community-based treatment programs required frequent and structured forums for cross-system communication. Challenges related to recruitment and enrollment, staffing, MAT, and data collection were addressed through the collaborative development and continuous review of policies and procedures. This study found CFIR to be a useful framework for understanding implementation uptake and barriers. The framework was particularly valuable in reinforcing the use of implementation research as a means for continuous process improvement. CFIR is a comprehensive and flexible framework that may be adopted in future cross-system evaluations.}

In recent years, social media has been repeatedly used as a tool to incite communal aggression, spread distorted propaganda, damage social harmony and demean the identity of individuals or a community in the public spaces. Therefore, restraining the proliferation of aggressive content and detecting them has become an urgent duty. Studies of the identification of aggressive content have mostly been done for English and other high-resource languages. Automatic systems developed for those languages can not accurately identify detrimental contents written in regional languages like Bengali. To compensate this insufficiency, this work presents a novel Bengali aggressive text dataset (called ‘BAD’) with two-level annotation. In level-A, 14158 texts are labeled as either aggressive or non-aggressive. While in level-B, 6807 aggressive texts are categorized into religious, political, verbal and gendered aggression classes each having 2217, 2085, 2043 and 462 texts respectively. This paper proposes a weighted ensemble technique including m-BERT, distil-BERT, Bangla-BERT and XLM-R as the base classifiers to identify and classify the aggressive texts in Bengali. The proposed model can readdress the softmax probabilities of the participating classifiers depending on their primary outcomes. This weighting technique has enabled the model to outdo the simple average ensemble and all other machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) baselines. It has acquired the highest weighted f1-score of 93.43% in the identification task and 93.11% in the categorization task.

Consequently, strategies for identifying evasive language under interrogation are suggested. In essence, by not giving direct answers, the examples underscore the creative and powerful crafting of political discourse by skilled speakers to assuage the appearance of culpability in actions or inactions which could prove politically damaging while providing “appropriate” responses (Berlin, 2007, Harris, 1991, Janney, 2002) within the context of an investigative hearing.}

Demographic and psychosocial characteristics are compared to a national, population-based study. RECOVER participants (N = 533) tend to be single, white, males aged 26 years or older. Mean age at first opioid use was 21.7 years; lifetime substance-related overdose was 24.2%. At first assessment, 334 (62.7%) participants reported past 7-day and 296 (55.5%) reported past 28-day opioid abstinence. Five hundred UDS were collected at the first assessment; buprenorphine (90.6%), marijuana (45.2%), and opiates (34.4%) were most commonly identified. Two hundred forty-nine (47.2%) participants reported full- or part-time employment. Participants were like a national sample with differences found for age, race/ethnicity, employment, education, and health-related quality of life.

More precisely, we focus on issues arising in multiple drone systems to support communications and situational awareness for the planning and execution of agile and effective search and rescue operation in diverse disaster scenarios. This is of utmost importance to mitigate the impact of the destruction and, in particular, the loss of life. After describing two key operation scenarios, we point out challenges arising in communications and control, and outline a systems design framework leading to the formulation of the several optimal motion control problems that, typically, feature state constraints. Then, a Pontryagin maximum principle in the Gamkrelidze form is presented. Under certain regularity assumptions, its measure multiplier is continuous, and, thus, amenable to the formulation of effective computational algorithms based on indirect methods. Feedback control strategies to compensate for motion disturbances, on the one hand, and the optimization over multiple concatenated modes of operation - often entailing the need of different dynamic models -, on the other hand, are obtained by embedding the procedure to solve the optimal control problem in a receding horizon framework of the model predictive control type.}

abstract = {Objectives
The rapid increase in opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD) over the past 20 years is a complex problem associated with significant economic costs for healthcare systems and society. Simulation models have been developed to capture and identify ways to manage this complexity and to evaluate the potential costs of different strategies to reduce overdoses and OUD. A review of simulation-based economic evaluations is warranted to fully characterize this set of literature.
Methods
A systematic review of simulation-based economic evaluation (SBEE) studies in opioid research was initiated by searches in PubMed, EMBASE, and EbscoHOST. Extraction of a predefined set of items and a quality assessment were performed for each study.
Results
The screening process resulted in 23 SBEE studies ranging by year of publication from 1999 to 2019. Methodological quality of the cost analyses was moderately high. The most frequently evaluated strategies were methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments; the only harm reduction strategy explored was naloxone distribution. These strategies were consistently found to be cost-effective, especially naloxone distribution and methadone maintenance. Prevention strategies were limited to abuse-deterrent opioid formulations. Less than half (39%) of analyses adopted a societal perspective in their estimation of costs and effects from an opioid-related intervention. Prevention strategies and studies’ accounting for patient and physician preference, changing costs, or result stratification were largely ignored in these SBEEs.
Conclusion
The review shows consistently favorable cost analysis findings for naloxone distribution strategies and opioid agonist treatments and identifies major gaps for future research.}

Among 938,245 examinations, 0.17% had an SUD-related indication. Patients with SUD-related indications were younger (mean 37.2 ± 11.1 versus 53.5 ± 22.4, P < .001) and more commonly male (65% versus 52%, P < .001). The proportions of MR (17%), spine (17%), and extremities (33%) studies performed for SUD-related indications were larger among SUD than non-SUD indications (6%, 8%, 26%, respectively, all P < .001). Regression analysis demonstrated the odds of acquiring an ED imaging examination with an SUD-related indication significantly increased over time (P < .001, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.06), which was most pronounced among MR (P < .001, aOR = 1.23). For all regression models, younger age, male gender, and body part being imaged were identified as independent predictors of an SUD-related indication for ED imaging.
Conclusion
Imaging performed for an SUD-related indication represented a small but increasing subset of overall ED imaging. Utilization of MR for SUD-related indications significantly outpaced growth of MR without SUD-related indications.}

abstract = {Metaverse is the next disruptive technology that will impact society in the coming decades, by enabling immersive experiences in both virtual and physical environments. Although still conceptual, Metaverse converges the physical and digital universe, allowing users to seamlessly traverse between them. Digital immersion offers opportunities for people to travel in time, supporting users to experience virtually ancient encounters, space explorations or dangerous natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions. Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse. Although still experimental, Metaverse is expected to revolutionize travel and tourism management and marketing. It empowers destination awareness, positioning and branding, as well as coordination and management, through digital twins. Metaverse provides opportunities to support trip planning, interaction and engagement, effectively transforming consumer behaviour. Visiting and engaging with destinations virtually is expected to motivate real travel, rather than replace it. This paper provides a vision of how Metaverse can revolutionize tourism experiences and transform tourism management and marketing. Drawing on a systematic review of scholarly works, articles from media and industry reports, this study defines and conceptualizes the Metaverse ecosystem for tourism and travel. It explores the foundations of the disruptions that Metaverse brings to tourism destinations and organisations and identifies the building blocks of Metaverse tourism. The study outlines research directions so that the tourism industry can take full advantage of the Metaverse capabilities and opportunities emerging as well as identify challenges for the future.}

Moreover, recent results and industrial proofs of concept show that these technologies demonstrate critical advantages in the industry. Nevertheless, the authoring and editing process of virtual and augmented content remains time-consuming, especially in complex industrial scenarios. While the use of interactive virtual environments through virtual and augmented reality presents new possibilities for many domains, a wider adoption of VR/AR is possible only if the authoring process is simplified, allowing for more rapid development and configuration without the need for advanced IT skills. To meet this goal, this study presents a new framework: INTERVALES. First, framework architecture is proposed, along with its different modules; this study then shows that the framework can be updated by not only IT workers, but also other job experts. The UML data model is presented to format and simplify the authoring processes for both VR and AR. This model takes into account virtual and augmented environments, the possible interactions, and ease operations orchestration. Finally, this paper presents the implementation of an industrial use case composed of collaborative robotic (cobotic) and manual assembly workstations in VR and AR based on INTERVALES data.}

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is effective for alcohol and opioid use disorders but it is stigmatized and underutilized in criminal justice settings.
Methods
This study cluster-randomized 20 community corrections sites to determine whether an experimental implementation strategy of training and an organizational linkage intervention improved staff perceptions of MAT and referral intentions more than training alone. The 3-hour training was designed to address deficits in knowledge, perceptions and referral information, and the organizational linkage intervention brought together community corrections and addiction treatment agencies in an interagency strategic planning and implementation process over 12months.
Results
Although training alone was associated with increases in familiarity with pharmacotherapy and knowledge of where to refer clients, the experimental intervention produced significantly greater improvements in functional attitudes (e.g. that MAT is helpful to clients) and referral intentions. Corrections staff demonstrated greater improvements in functional perceptions and intent to refer opioid dependent clients for MAT than did treatment staff.
Conclusion
Knowledge, perceptions and information training plus interorganizational strategic planning intervention is an effective means to change attitudes and intent to refer clients for medication assisted treatment in community corrections settings, especially among corrections staff.}

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

abstract = {Background
The Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) is an emergency medical dispatch (EMD) system that is widely used to prioritize 9-1-1 calls and optimize resource allocation. Calls are assigned an MPDS determinant, which includes a number (1–32) representing chief complaint and priority (Alpha through Echo) representing acuity.
Objective
This study evaluates the number of emergency dispatches per cardiac arrest (NOD-CA) in cardiac arrest and non-cardiac arrest MPDS determinants.
Methods
All patients assigned a determinant by MPDS from January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 in a large metropolitan area were included. Prehospital electronic patient care records were linked with dispatch data. For each MPDS determinant, the number of calls for which the paramedic impression was listed as “Cardiac Arrest – Non-Traumatic” was tabulated. The NOD-CA was calculated for each cardiac arrest and non-cardiac arrest MPDS determinant. Non-MPDS calls with cardiac arrests were analyzed separately.
Results
A total of 101,642 patients were included. Among them, 555 had “Cardiac Arrest – Non-Traumatic” listed as the paramedic impression. The Cardiac/Respiratory Arrest/Death protocol had the highest number of cardiac arrests (285), followed by Breathing Problems (99) and Unconscious/Fainting (76). Overall, 183 dispatched occurred for each cardiac arrest, 131 of which resulted in a lights and sirens response. The NOD-CA was 7 in the Cardiac Arrest/Death protocol, 122 in Breathing Problems, and 104 in Unconscious/Fainting. 31 Cardiac arrests occurred in non-MPDS dispatch categories (N=62,989), most of which were calls for medical assistance from police or fire units.
Conclusions
MPDS was designed to detect cardiac arrest with high sensitivity, leading to a significant degree of mistriage. The number of dispatches for each cardiac arrest may be a useful way to quantify the degree of mistriage and optimize EMS dispatch. This large descriptive study revealed a low NOD-CA in most cardiac arrest MPDS determinants. We demonstrated significant variability in the NOD-CA among non-cardiac arrest MPDS determinants, and few cardiac arrests in non-MPDS dispatch categories.}

It has currently been identified in the environment and human bodies; nonetheless, the possible toxicities are not well-known. Zebrafish have been used as a toxicant screening model due to their fast and transparent developmental processes. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFHxS for five days, and various experiments were performed to monitor the developmental and cellular processes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis confirmed that PFHxS was absorbed and accumulated in the zebrafish embryos. We reported that 2.5 µM or higher PFHxS exposure induced phenotypic abnormalities, marked by developmental delay in the mid-hind brain boundary and yolk sac edema. Additionally, larvae exposed to PFHxS displayed facial malformation due to the reduction of neural crest cell expression. RNA sequencing analysis further identified 4643 differentiated expressed transcripts in 5 µM PFHxS-exposed 5-days post fertilization (5-dpf) larvae. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress were enriched in the PFHxS-exposed larvae. To validate these findings, a series of biological experiments were conducted. PFHxS exposure led to a nearly 4-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, possibly due to hyperglycemia and impaired glutathione balance. The Oil Red O’ staining and qPCR analysis strengthens the notions that lipid metabolism was disrupted, leading to lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde formation. All these alterations ultimately affected cell cycle events, resulting in S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PFHxS could accumulate and induce various developmental toxicities in aquatic life, and such data might assist the government to accelerate the regulatory policy on PFHxS usage.}

Thus, based on the headache history, clinical examination, and presence of headache red flags, a focused diagnostic evaluation is recommended, ranging from blood tests to neuroimaging, depending on the headache characteristics. Regardless of the primary or secondary headache disorder diagnosis, treatment options may be limited in older patients and may need to be tailored to the presence of comorbid medical conditions. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the management of headache in older adults, from diagnosis to treatment.}

abstract = {Background
Interventions requiring abstinence from alcohol are neither preferred by nor shown to be highly effective with many homeless individuals with alcohol dependence. It is therefore important to develop lower-threshold, patient-centered interventions for this multimorbid and high-utilizing population. Harm-reduction counseling requires neither abstinence nor use reduction and pairs a compassionate style with patient-driven goal-setting. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), a monthly injectable formulation of an opioid receptor antagonist, reduces craving and may support achievement of harm-reduction goals. Together, harm-reduction counseling and XR-NTX may support alcohol harm reduction and quality-of-life improvement.
Aims
Study aims include testing: a) the relative efficacy of XR-NTX and harm-reduction counseling compared to a community-based, supportive-services-as-usual control, b) theory-based mediators of treatment effects, and c) treatment effects on publicly funded service costs.
Methods
This RCT involves four arms: a) XR-NTX+harm-reduction counseling, b) placebo+harm-reduction counseling, c) harm-reduction counseling only, and d) community-based, supportive-services-as-usual control conditions. Participants are currently/formerly homeless, alcohol dependent individuals (N=300). Outcomes include alcohol variables (i.e., craving, quantity/frequency, problems and biomarkers), health-related quality of life, and publicly funded service utilization and associated costs. Mediators include 10-point motivation rulers and the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale. XR-NTX and harm-reduction counseling are administered every 4weeks over the 12-week treatment course. Follow-up assessments are conducted at weeks 24 and 36.
Discussion
If found efficacious, XR-NTX and harm-reduction counseling will be well-positioned to support reductions in alcohol-related harm, decreases in costs associated with publicly funded service utilization, and increases in quality of life among homeless, alcohol-dependent individuals.}

Over the years, Logistic Service Providers (LSPs) have learned how to ensure resilience to confront uncertainties and risks triggered by adverse events. However, quite unlike any seen in recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic brings about unavoidable uncertainties and risks for the logistics industry. Yet, there is no common approach to contextualize how they interact together. We incorporate an empirical research design and make a threefold contribution: first, we identify uncertainties and risks that LSPs encounter during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate their prominence. Second, we unveil intertwined schemes of afore-identified uncertainties and risks and augment the understanding of their cause-effect structure. Third, we provide an uncertainty and risk assessment guideline for LSPs affected by threats emerging from unforeseeable crises. In this study, we combine qualitative work and the fuzzy DEMATEL method. Qualitative thematic analysis of in-depth interviews reveals the most important uncertainties (COVID-19 measures, employee welfare, forecast horizon, demand change, and government regulations) and risks (COVID-19 risk, delivery delays, supply chain disruptions, financial failure, and product returns) for LSPs. The fuzzy DEMATEL method shows that COVID-19 measures and COVID-19 risk are highly prominent and influence other factors. The results indicate that demand change, government regulations, and supply chain disruptions are net causers, and employee welfare, financial failure, forecast horizon, delivery delays, and product returns are net receivers. Distinctly, employee welfare is the most affected factor, empirically confirming that major risks for LSPs are related to the human factor. More investigation in our results suggests that supply chain disruptions and demand change, two factors triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, influence financial failure and forecast horizon, two factors associated with operational performance.}

The prototype provides a full-body and multi-user VR experience, based on the synthesis of position data provided by the motion capture system and orientation data from the VR headsets. As a consequence, the prototype allows an initial evaluation of results. The results confirm the value of using VR to train procedures that are difficult to train in the real world.

Atlantooccipital dislocation (AOD) is a highly unstable and often neurologically devastating injury to the craniocervical junction that typically results from high-energy trauma. Management of these devastating injuries is complex, with prognostication difficult due to high rates of concomitant intracranial and systemic injuries. This report highlights advances in management of AOD and appropriate implementation of operative adjuncts including neuronavigation and the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring.
Methods
All patients with AOD presenting to a high-volume, level 1 trauma center between January 2015 and August 2021 were retrospectively identified through a prospectively maintained database of patients presenting with traumatic spine injuries. Medical records, including imaging reports, clinical documentation, and intraoperative neurophysiological reports were reviewed.
Results
A total of 11 patients were identified with patterns of injury consistent with AOD. Fifty-five percent of patients survived until discharge. 73% of patients underwent surgery for stabilization. All 4 patients with preoperative neurologic deficits who underwent surgery had monitorable transcranial motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials. Two experienced significant motor recovery postoperatively, and 2 did not survive to discharge. Blunt cerebrovascular injuries were identified in 73% of patients.
Conclusion
AOD is encountered with increasing frequency. The identification and management of this specific injury is complicated by the volume and severity of associated injuries, especially concomitant traumatic brain injury. Timely recognition is critical and the use of surgical adjuncts including intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring and surgical navigation can increase the safety and success of these procedures while also providing prognostic information on potential for motor recovery.}

We propose a theoretical model that reconciles our findings with the results in the literature. In our model, during “normal times” strong firm-level governance is crucial to attract outside financing in countries with weak investor protection, but is less important in countries with good investor protection. During a crisis, however, investment opportunities decline even in countries with strong investor protection, and, as a result, relative importance of firm-level governance increases in such places.}

More than just game content, metaverses are driving everyday innovation across industries. However, threats are also prevalent, with crimes such as child sexual exploitation and privacy violations occurring in metaverses that mimic reality, making digital forensics for metaverse threats essential. Nevertheless, technical standards for different types of metaverses have yet to be defined, making investigation difficult. Furthermore, even though metaverses are complex forms that combine multiple hardware devices and software applications, existing studies have either focused on a single component or not analyzed the real-world environment. In this study, we derived a metaverse ecosystem with common components that comprise a metaverse and analyzed the hardware and software used throughout the user's metaverse lifecycle from a digital forensics perspective. In particular, we applied real-case-based scenario to the metaverse environment of the most popular Meta's currently in use to identify various artifacts that can be used across the ecosystem and validate the effectiveness of the process. We also developed a metaverse digital forensics tool for the first time in the current situation where open-source and commercial tools do not support metaverse investigations.}

However, there is a gap of information on the potential misuse of fentanyl and tramadol in China. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing fentanyl and tramadol in wastewater of major cities across China to estimate their use. Wastewater samples were collected from 30 cities located across all seven geographic regions of China, from 2016 to 2019. Fentanyl was detected in only a few samples, suggesting a low prevalence of this potent opioid drug in China. Meanwhile, tramadol was found in most samples with concentrations ranging up to 186 ng/L. The per capita daily consumption of tramadol estimated from wastewater across China ranged from 6 mg/d/1000 in. to 213 mg/d/1000 inh. The consumption of tramadol seems to be similar among all the days of the week. Tramadol use is overall higher in Northeast China than in other regions, which is different from heroin, another popular opioid in China. Temporally, there is a significant decrease in tramadol use in major cities of China from 2016 to 2019. The results of our study suggested that tramadol use in China was predominantly from pharmaceutical prescription and not as prevalent as in other countries.}

This framework includes elements for hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, verification of barrier performance and monitoring for any changes to the hazards that influence source water quality. The next revision of the ADWG will incorporate Health-Based Targets (HBTs) for achieving microbiologically safe drinking water. This incorporates Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment and the metric of Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) to define safety, with a target of 1×10−6 Disability Adjusted Life Year (1 microDALY) set as the maximum tolerable disease burden from drinking water, which in the case of Cryptosporidium is <1.3×10−5oocysts/L. The resulting product water specification, in combination with knowledge of pathogen challenges in source waters, allows the determination of the treatment requirements to ensure public safety. The ADWG revision provides default removal values for Cryptosporidium for particular treatment processes, such as conventional coagulation and dual media filtration. However, these values are based on assumptions regarding treatment plant design, operation and water quality. To properly manage risk and demonstrate compliance with the guidelines, water utilities may need to validate treatment performance for Cryptosporidium removal. A particular limitation is the absence of Cryptosporidium surrogates for full-scale filter validation. This paper will provide an overview of risk-based management of drinking water safety in Australia, the development of health-based targets for microbial pathogens and the evaluation of Cryptosporidium surrogates for conventional coagulation and dual media filtration.}

abstract = {Background
The opioid epidemic remains a public health crisis and most people with opioid use disorder (OUD) do not receive effective treatment. The emergency department (ED) can be a critical entry point for treatment. EDs are developing and implementing ED-based efforts to address OUD to improve access to OUD treatment. This study's objective is to identify features of ED-based OUD treatment programs that relate to program implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability.
Methods
We obtained data through literature review and semistructured interviews with ED physicians and leaders. The study analyzed these data to develop a framework of key components of ED-based efforts and highlight barriers and facilitators to implementation and program effectiveness.
Results
We identify five key features of ED-based opioid treatment programs that vary across programs and may influence effectiveness and impact: patient identification methods; treatment approaches; program structure; relationship with community partners; and financing and sustainability. Successful implementation of ED-based OUD treatment includes having a champion, a reliable referral network, and systematic tracking and reporting of data for monitoring and feedback.
Conclusion
Going forward, attention to these features may help to improve effectiveness. As researchers conduct studies of ED-based care models, they should assess the impact of variation in key features to improve program effectiveness.}

When these disasters strike, it is imperative to rapidly locate and recover human victims, both the living and deceased. While search and rescue dogs are used to locate the living, cadaver detection dogs are typically tasked with locating the dead. This can prove challenging because commingling of victims is likely to occur during disasters in populated areas which will impact the decomposition process and the resulting odour produced. To date, there has been no research to investigate the process of human decomposition in a mass disaster scenario or to understand which compounds are detectable by cadaver detection dogs. Hence, the current study investigated the human decomposition process and subsequent volatile organic compound (VOC) production in two simulated building collapse scenarios with six human donors placed in each scenario. The human remains were only recovered after a period of one month, during which time VOC samples were collected and analysed using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A considerable degree of differential decomposition was observed upon recovery of the human remains, which was carried out as a part of a police disaster victim recovery training exercise. The location of the bodies in the disaster area was found to impact the decomposition process. The VOC profile was found to correlate with the decomposition process. Fifteen days following the simulated disaster, the VOC profile changed showing that a detectable change in the decomposition process had occurred. Overall, the changing VOC profile can inform the training of cadaver detection dogs for these unique scenarios.}

It is concluded that the reduction in road injuries in the year following the change was consistent with contemporary claims that changes to the rural speed distribution were major causative factors. These changes included a sharp drop in rural mean speeds and a sharp contraction in the spread of these speeds. Although mean speeds have since climbed to nearly their 1973 levels, the spread of speeds, manifested particularly by the number travelling at very high speeds, remains smaller than in 1973. It would appear probable that this factor is still favourably influencing road injury levels. It is also suggested the lack of a discernible link between rural speed limit violations and speeds since 1974 should raise questions as to the effectiveness of speed law enforcement in New Zealand.}

Developments in generative design, topology optimization, light weighting and latticing software, and new additive manufacturing processes has increased the robustness and quickness to manufacture PPE, s with exceptional design freedom and superior performance. In today’s world where corona virus is creating a huge problem to everyone, the industrial sector is down all across the globe as most industries are working on 30% of overall workers, a process like 3D printing is the right way to still keep the production level high. In 3D printing one only needs to feed the machine the design that you want to make, and the machine prints that model using plastic or metal material. This can be especially useful as there is no contact between the workers and can be done easily. The design can be made while sitting at home and the model after printing can be taken out by a single worker, thus allowing the industry to work at 30% of its workforce. Currently there is a huge requirement of personal protective equipment as they can be proved as the line between life and death. This review paper discusses the capabilities of 3D printing in making protective equipment such as helmets, protective masks, prosthesis, knee braces, goggles, test swabs, fire fighting gears and earplugs.}

Convensional queuing theory that concentrates on measures of average performance is not readily adaptable to this application. In a major police department, average values of delay response were found to be acceptable, and preliminary analysis showed that sufficient resources were available to avoid excessive queuing at peak loads. Nevertheless, reports of occasional excessively delayed responses indicated the existence of serious problems. Extreme value theory concentrates on the statistically rare long delays that, because of the many repetitions of requests for service, can occur more frequently in time than is acceptable to police management. In the example discussed, the predicted magnitudes and frequencies of these long delays provided the justification for an immediate improvement program. In general, the straightforward methodology described would appear to have broad applications and great practical value.

Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder but is rarely initiated in US prisons or with criminal justice populations. Mobile treatment for chronic diseases has been implemented in a variety of settings. Mobile treatment may provide an opportunity to expand outreach to parolees to surmount barriers to traditional clinic treatment.
Methods
Male and female prisoners (240) with pre-incarceration histories of opioid use disorder who are within one month of release from prison will be enrolled in this randomized clinical trial. Participants are randomized to one of two study arms: 1) [XR-NTX-OTx] One injection of long-acting naltrexone in prison, followed by 6 monthly injections post-release at a community opioid treatment program; or 2) [XR-NTX+ MMTx] One injection of long-acting naltrexone in prison followed by 6 monthly injections post-release at the patient's place of residence utilizing mobile medical treatment. The primary outcomes are: treatment adherence; opioid use; criminal activity; re-arrest; reincarceration; and HIV risk-behaviors.
Results
We describe the background and rationale for the study, its aims, hypotheses, and study design.
Conclusions
The use of long-acting injectable naltrexone may be a promising form of treatment for pre-release prisoners. Finally, as many individuals in the criminal justice system drop out of treatment, this study will assess whether treatment at their place of residence will improve adherence and positively affect treatment outcomes.

These videos can be shared across different platforms exposing them to any kind of intentional manipulation by criminals who are aware of the weaknesses of forensic techniques to accuse an innocent person or exonerate a guilty person in a judicial process. Commonly, manufacturers do not comply 100% with the specifications of the standards for the creation of videos. Also, videos shared on social networks, and instant messaging applications go through filtering and compression processes to reduce their size, facilitate their transfer, and optimize storage on their platforms. The omission of specifications and results of transformations carried out by the platforms embed a features pattern in the multimedia container of the videos. These patterns make it possible to distinguish the brand of the device that generated the video, social network, and instant messaging application that was used for the transfer. Research in recent years has focused on the analysis of AVI containers and tiny video datasets. This work presents a novel technique to detect possible attacks against MP4, MOV, and 3GP format videos that affect their integrity and authenticity. The method is based on the analysis of the structure of video containers generated by mobile devices and their behavior when shared through social networks, instant messaging applications, or manipulated by editing programs.

abstract = {Background
The incidence of cardiovascular disease is on the increase in Africa and with it, an increase in the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). OHCA carries a high mortality, especially in low-resource settings. Interventions to treat OHCA, such as mass cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training campaigns are costly. One cost-effective and scalable intervention is telephone-guided bystander CPR (tCPR). Little data exists regarding the quality of tCPR. This study aimed to determine quality of tCPR in untrained members of the public. Participants were also asked to provide their views on the understandability of the tCPR instructions.
Methods
This study followed a prospective, simulation-based observational study design. Adult laypeople who have not had previous CPR training were recruited at public CPR training events and asked to perform CPR on a manikin. Quality was assessed in terms of hand placement, compression rate, compression depth, chest recoil, and chest exposure. tCPR instructions were provided by a trained medical provider, via loudspeaker. Participants were also asked to complete a short questionnaire afterwards, detailing the understandability of the tCPR instructions. Data were analysed descriptively and compared to recommended quality guidance.
Results
Fifty participants were enrolled. Hand placement was accurate in 74 % (n = 37) of participants, while compression depth and chest recoil only had compliance in 20 % (n = 10) and 24 % (n = 12) of participants, respectively. The mean compression rate was within guidelines in just under half (48 %, n = 24) of all participants. Only 20 (40 %) participants exposed the manikin's chest. Only 46 % (n = 23) of participants felt that the overall descriptions offered during the tCPR guidance were understandable, while 80 % (n = 40) and 36 % (n = 18) felt that the instructions on hand placement and compression rate were understandable, respectively. Lastly, 94 % (n = 47) of participants agreed that they would be more likely to perform bystander CPR if they were provided with tCPR.
Conclusion
The quality of CPR performed by laypersons is generally suboptimal and this may affect patient outcomes. There is an urgent need to develop more understandable tCPR algorithms that may encourage bystanders to start CPR and optimise its quality.}

abstract = {A two-phase method of key recovery which will be referred to as Secure Key Recovery (SKR) is presented. The proposed key recovery system permits a portion of the key recovery information to be generated once and then used for multiple encrypted data communications sessions and encrypted file applications. In particular, the portion of the key recovery information that is generated just once is the only portion that requires public key encryption operations. We also describe a verification mode in which the communicating parties each produce SKR recovery information independently, without checking the other's so produced information. In this mode, if at least one side is correctly configured, all required recovery information is correctly produced. In addition, the communicating parties are free to include any optional recovery fields without causing a false invalidation of what the other parties sent. Further, we present a method of verification of key recovery information within a key recovery system, based on a variation of the three-party Diffie-Hellman key agreement procedure. Without communication with a trustee, the sender is able to encrypt recovery information in such a way that both the receiver and the respective trustee can decrypt it. This reduces the number of encryptions, and inherently validates the recovery information when the receiver decrypts it. The method allows full caching of all public key operations, thus further reducing computational overhead.}

abstract = {Growing concern over the environmental and health impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has led to the development of increasingly stringent regulatory guidelines. To meet these guidelines for the determination of PFASs in surface-water, solid-phase extraction (SPE) is commonly implemented for clean-up and pre-concentration of samples. In this paper a micro-SPE method for the clean-up and pre-concentration of PFASs from surface-water was developed. A micro-SPE packing phase was created to retain 13 long and short chain PFAS after examining combinations of four 3 µm particle size sorbents, with the optimal phase consisting of a 50:50 mixture of C18 and aminopropyl silica. Micro-SPE achieved similar results to conventional SPE methods while reducing sample preparation time to 5 min and using only 2 mL of sample. The method was validated using spiked recoveries (100 ng L−1) from PFAS contaminated surface-water samples with recoveries ranging from 86% to 111% and relative standard deviations below 18%. Concentrations of the PFASs in the samples ranged from below the limit of quantification to 898 ± 15 ng L−1. Automation of sample preparation, including the micro-SPE extraction, was also demonstrated. These results show the potential for automated micro-SPE to replace conventional SPE, with the decreases in sample preparation time, sample and solvent volumes crucial for incorporation into routine analyses in commercial laboratories.}

abstract = {Objective
Successful retention on buprenorphine improves outcomes for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, we know little about associations between use of non–prescribed buprenorphine (NPB) preceding treatment intake and clinical outcomes.
Methods
The study conducted observational retrospective analysis of abstracted electronic health record (EHR) data from a multi-state nationwide office-based opioid treatment program. The study observed a random sample of 1000 newly admitted patients with OUD for buprenorphine maintenance (2015–2018) for up to 12 months following intake. We measured use of NPB by mandatory intake drug testing and manual EHR coding. Outcomes included hazards of treatment discontinuation and rates of opioid use.
Results
Compared to patients testing negative for buprenorphine at intake, those testing positive (59.6%) had lower hazards of treatment discontinuation (HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.60, p < 0.01). Results were little changed following adjustment for baseline opioid use and other patient characteristics (aHR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.70, p < 0.01). Risk of discontinuation did not significantly differ between patients by buprenorphine source: prescribed v. NPB (reference) at admission (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.46). Opioid use was lower in the buprenorphine positive group at admission (25.0% vs. 53.1%, p < 0.0001) and throughout early months of treatment but converged after 7 months for those remaining in care (17.1% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.89).
Conclusion
NPB preceding treatment intake was associated with decreased hazards of treatment discontinuation and lower opioid use. These findings suggest use of NPB may be a marker of treatment readiness and that buprenorphine testing at intake may have predictive value for clinical assessments regarding risk of early treatment discontinuation.}

abstract = {A novel and accurate method for matching of heterogeneous faces, such as sketch and near-infrared (NIR) images, with the visible (VIS) photo gallery and vice a versa has been presented here. A new geometric edge-texture feature (GETF) is proposed, which is not only able to capture the edge information but also the texture information. GETF is constructed from the combined information of edge and texture image of same individual. For texture information local binary pattern (LBP) is used, while for edge information canny edge detection is chosen. Edges are sensitive to illumination, so before applying canny edge operation, we convert the image into illumination invariant gradient domain. For each pixel of the edge image, the nearest edge pixel is found. Finally, the total hamming distance between any pixel and its nearest edge pixel of the corresponding texture image gives GETFDist and the angle between them gives the GETFAng feature. To classify the heterogeneous faces we proposed a multiple fuzzy-classifier system, which is a combination of fuzzy partial least square (FPLS) and fuzzy local feature-based discriminant analysis (FLFDA). We have tested statistically that, the proposed classifier performs better than the individual classifiers. In sketch-photo matching, a rank-1 accuracy of 99.66% is achieved in a gallery of 606 photos consisting of CUHK student dataset, AR face dataset, and XM2VTS dataset. In NIR–VIS image matching, a rank-1 accuracy of 99.50% is achieved in a gallery of 400 VIS images from CASIA-HFB dataset.}

Based on a county-industry level panel from 1998 to 2007 in China, we find that industrial clusters significantly increase local industries' productivity by lifting the average firm productivity and reallocating resources from less to more productive firms. Moreover, we find major mechanisms through which resource reallocation is improved within clusters: (i) clusters are associated with a higher firm turnover with increased entry and exit rates simultaneously; and (ii) within clusters' environment, the dispersion of individual firm's markup is significantly reduced, indicating intensified local competition within clusters. Such results suggest that industrial clusters in China help improve regional productivity and resource allocation efficiency with intensified competition and accelerated firm dynamics. The identification issues are carefully addressed by two-stage estimations with instrumental variables and other robustness checks.}

abstract = {Background
Methamphetamine use is increasing among persons with opioid use disorder (OUD). The study aims were to describe methamphetamine/amphetamine (MA/A) use among patients treated for OUD with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP-NX) or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), and to explore associations between treatment arm and MA/A use.
Methods
Secondary analysis of data from a multi-site, open-label, randomized controlled trial of XR-NTX versus BUP-NX for 24 weeks. The outcome variable was MA/A use defined by either positive urine drug toxicology or self-report. The main predictor was treatment assignment (BUP-NX v. XR-NTX). Longitudinal mixed-effects logistic regression models were fit to model the odds of MA/A use during the study. Additional predictors included study visit and baseline MA/A use.
Results
Among the sample of 570 participants with OUD, baseline use of MA/A was observed in 105 (18.4%). There was no significant treatment effect over the study period, though BUP-NX subjects, on average, had about half the odds of MA/A use compared to XR-NTX subjects (OR=0.50; p = 0.051). In the same model, baseline MA/A use and study visit were both significantly associated with MA/A use over time.
Conclusion
In this sample of treated OUD patients, nearly a fifth of participants had MA/A use at baseline and the frequency of use did not decline over time: in fact, the odds of use slightly increased for each later visit. These secondary analyses found no significant difference in MA/A use between BUP-NX and XR-NTX treatment arms, however, the observation of less MA/A in the buprenorphine arm merits further investigation.

abstract = {DNA in eukaryotic cells is packaged into the compact and dynamic structure of chromatin. This packaging is a double-edged sword for DNA repair and genomic stability. Chromatin restricts the access of repair proteins to DNA lesions embedded in nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures. However, chromatin also serves as a signaling platform in which post-translational modifications of histones and other chromatin-bound proteins promote lesion recognition and repair. Similarly, chromatin modulates the formation of DNA damage, promoting or suppressing lesion formation depending on the chromatin context. Therefore, the modulation of DNA damage and its repair in chromatin is crucial to our understanding of the fate of potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic lesions in DNA. Here, we survey many of the landmark findings on DNA damage and repair in chromatin over the last 50 years (i.e., since the beginning of this field), focusing on excision repair, the first repair mechanism studied in the chromatin landscape. For example, we highlight how the impact of chromatin on these processes explains the distinct patterns of somatic mutations observed in cancer genomes.}

Participants from the CoVIDA project were included. A logistic regression using the model was chosen based on biological plausibility and the Akaike Information criterion. Also, we performed an analysis using machine learning with random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting. The study included 58,577 participants with a positivity rate of 5.7%. The logistic regression showed that anosmia (aOR = 7.76, 95% CI [6.19, 9.73]), fever (aOR = 4.29, 95% CI [3.07, 6.02]), headache (aOR = 3.29, 95% CI [1.78, 6.07]), dry cough (aOR = 2.96, 95% CI [2.44, 3.58]), and fatigue (aOR = 1.93, 95% CI [1.57, 2.93]) were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model had an area under the curve of 0.73. The symptoms-based model correctly identified over 85% of participants. This model can be used to prioritize resource allocation related to COVID-19 diagnosis, to decide on early isolation, and contact-tracing strategies in individuals with a high probability of infection before receiving a confirmatory test result. This strategy has public health and clinical decision-making significance in low- and middle-income settings like Latin America.}

Amongst these are communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks, and audio–video surveillance. Each of these can potentially provide the means for privacy intrusion. De-identification is one of the main approaches to privacy protection in multimedia contents (text, still images, audio and video sequences and their combinations). It is a process for concealing or removing personal identifiers, or replacing them by surrogate personal identifiers in personal information in order to prevent the disclosure and use of data for purposes unrelated to the purpose for which the information was originally obtained. Based on the proposed taxonomy inspired by the Safe Harbour approach, the personal identifiers, i.e., the personal identifiable information, are classified as non-biometric, physiological and behavioural biometric, and soft biometric identifiers. In order to protect the privacy of an individual, all of the above identifiers will have to be de-identified in multimedia content. This paper presents a review of the concepts of privacy and the linkage among privacy, privacy protection, and the methods and technologies designed specifically for privacy protection in multimedia contents. The study provides an overview of de-identification approaches for non-biometric identifiers (text, hairstyle, dressing style, license plates), as well as for the physiological (face, fingerprint, iris, ear), behavioural (voice, gait, gesture) and soft-biometric (body silhouette, gender, age, race, tattoo) identifiers in multimedia documents.}

abstract = {Introduction
In June of 2008, Karoli Lwanga (“Nyakibale”) Hospital and Global Emergency Care Collaborative (GECC) opened the first functional Emergency Centre (EC) in rural Uganda. GECC is developing a training programme for a new cadre of midlevel Emergency Care Practitioners (ECPs), to increase access to quality emergency care. In order to determine the skills and resources needed, the unique practice demographics and the feasibility of treating patients in this setting must be understood.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional analysis of the first 500 consecutive patient visits in the EC’s patient care log was reviewed. Data on demographics, procedures performed, laboratory testing, bedside ultrasounds (USs) performed, radiographs (XRs) ordered, diagnoses, condition upon discharge and disposition were collated. Descriptive statistics were performed.
Results
Of the first 500 patient visits, there were 275 (55%) male visits and 132 (26.4%) visits for children under five. Procedures were performed in 367 (73.4%) patients. Laboratory testing, XRs and USs were performed in 188 (37.6%), 99 (19.8%) and 45 (7%) patients, respectively. Infectious diseases were diagnosed in 217 (43.4%) patients; traumatic injuries in 140 (28%) patients. Only one patient expired in the ED, and 401 (80.2%) were in good condition after treatment. One person was transferred to another hospital. After treatment, 180 (36%) patients were discharged home. Only five (1.0%) patients went directly to the operating theatre.
Conclusions
This pilot study describes the patient population, resource and training needs of a rural Emergency Centre in SSA. It demonstrates that acute care providers will be required to evaluate a wide variety of patient complaints, effectively utilise laboratory and radiologic testing, and perform numerous focused treatments and therapies. Specialised training programmes, such as GECC’s ECP programme, are needed to create providers able to provide high quality, lifesaving care.
Introduction
En juin 2008, l’hôpital KaroliLwanga (“Nyakibale”) et Global Emergency Care Collaborative (GECC) ont ouvert le premier centre d’urgence fonctionnel en zone rurale en Ouganda. GECC développe un programme de formation pour un nouveau corps de médecins urgentistes intermédiaires, afin d’augmenter l’accès à des soins d’urgence de qualité. Pour déterminer les compétences et les ressources requises, les comportements démographiques particuliers et la faisabilité du traitement des patients dans ce contexte doivent être compris.
Méthode
Une analyse transversale descriptive des 500 premières visites consécutives de patients inscrites au registre des patients du centre d’urgence a été réalisée. Les données démographiques, les procédures réalisées, les tests de laboratoire, les ultrasons pratiqués au chevet du patient, les radiographies prescrites, les diagnostics, l’état de santé à la sortie de l’hôpital ont été rassemblées. Des statistiques descriptives ont été élaborées.
Résultats
Sur les 500 premières visites de patients, 275 (55%) étaient des visites d’hommes et 132 (26,4%) des visites d’enfants de moins de 5 ans. Des procédures ont été réalisées pour 367 (73,4%) patients. Des tests de laboratoires, des radiographies, des ultrasons ont été réalisés respectivement chez 188 (37,6%), 99 (19,8%) et 45 (7%) patients. Des maladies infectieuses ont été diagnostiquées chez 217 (43,4%) patients; des blessures traumatiques chez 140 (28%) patients. Seul un patient est décédé dans le centre d’urgence, et 401 (80,2%) étaient en bonne santé après le traitement. Une personne a été transférée vers un autre hôpital. Après le traitement, 180 (36%) patients ont pu rentrer chez eux. Cinq patients seulement (1,0%) sont allés directement en salle d’opération.
Conclusions
Cette étude pilote décrit la population de patients, les besoins en ressources et en formation d’un service d’urgence en zone rurale en Afrique sub-saharienne. Elle montre que les prestataires de soins aigus seront requis pour évaluer une grande variété de plaintes des patients, utiliser efficacement les tests de laboratoire et radiologiques, réaliser de nombreux traitements locaux et des thérapies ciblées. Des programmes de formation spécialisés, tels que le Programme pour les médecins urgentistes du GECC, sont nécessaires pour que les prestataires dispensent des soins de bonne qualité et pouvant sauver la vie.}

Fingerprint samples were collected on glass slides from a volunteer who consumed separately tablets containing pseudoephedrine, codeine, dextromethorphan, and used lidocaine spray. Moreover, fingerprints of individuals receiving sertraline, hydroxyzine and trazodone as part of their long-term treatment were analysed. The detection of drugs was conducted using the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique. After administration of single doses of drugs, they were detected up to 36 h (pseudoephedrine), 24 h (codeine), and less than 6 h (dextromethorphan and lidocaine) with maximum concentrations observed at 1–4 h. In fingerprints of a person who has finished treatment with hydroxyzine and sertraline it was possible to detect these drugs even 20 days after last drug administration. Cetirizine (hydroxyzine metabolite) and mCPP (trazodone metabolite) were determined in fingerprints of individuals under long-term treatment. This work has demonstrated that forensic toxicology can use fingerprints as alternative material. Drugs can be detected in fingerprints even after their single doses. Parent compounds predominate over metabolites in the fingerprints. The detection window depends on the type of drug and duration of the treatment.}

abstract = {Objective
Despite the increasing use of e-scooters globally, the pattern of injuries on diagnostic imaging had not been well-documented to date. We performed a retrospective study utilizing our health system's radiology database to characterize the injury distribution and imaging features of scooter injuries.
Methods
We utilized our radiology report database searching for any imaging report containing the word “scooter”, beginning September 1, 2017, when scooters were first introduced to our area through December 1, 2018.
Results
Our search yielded a total of 54 patients with 105 imaging studies. The injuries predominantly affected the musculoskeletal system, with a predilection to the upper extremity. We had no cases of visceral or neurotrauma.
Conclusion
Musculoskeletal injuries were the predominant form of scooter injury. The lack of visceral injury suggests that emergency physicians should consider having a higher clinical threshold for ordering these studies in patients with scooter injuries.}

abstract = {Background
The most common immediate hypersensitivity to macrogols is associated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350; however, the epidemiology, mechanisms, and cross-reactivity are poorly understood. Thousands of medications contain either PEGs or structurally similar polysorbates.
Objective
Our objective was to better understand the mechanism, cross-reactivity, and scope of PEG hypersensitivity.
Methods
Two cases with a past history of immediate hypersensitivity to PEG-containing medications were used to study potential mechanisms and cross-reactivity of immediate reactions to PEG 3350. Skin testing and oral challenges with PEG and polysorbate-containing agents were employed to determine clinical reactivity and cross-reactivity between the 2 allergens. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and electrochemiluminescent immunoassay were used to detect anti-PEG specific IgG and IgE, respectively, using PEGylated protein or PEG alone as antigens in 2 cases and 6 PEG 3350 tolerant controls. We searched US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reports for immediate reactions to PEG 3350 to determine the potential scope of this problem in the United States.
Results
Skin and provocation testing demonstrated symptomatic reactivity in both cases to PEG 3350 and polysorbate 80. Plasma samples were positive for anti-PEG specific IgE and IgG antibodies only in cases and binding increased directly proportional to the molecular weight of PEG tested. FDA adverse event reports revealed 53 additional cases of possible PEG 3350 anaphylaxis.
Conclusions
Immediate hypersensitivity to PEG 3350 with cross-reactive polysorbate 80 hypersensitivity may be underrecognized in clinical practice and can be detected with clinical skin testing. Our studies raise the possibility of an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity mechanism in some cases.}

This study describes the degradation and defluorination of PFAS in stormwater collected from an AFFF-impacted site. Silica-based granular media (SGM) containing titanium dioxide was packed into a column reactor and placed between ultraviolet (UV) lamps to excite the photocatalyst within the SGM and generate free radicals to degrade PFAS present in water that was passed through the media. The system was amended with nucleophiles (hydroxyls) to facilitate the destruction of PFAS. Results showed rapid degradation of 17 identified PFAS, including perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors, perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). Significant defluorination was observed, indicating PFAS destruction as a result of the coupled photocatalytic and nucleophilic attack. Column reactor experiment findings indicate SGM in the presence of UV light passively degraded a mixture of PFAS in a concentrated waste stream at ambient conditions.}

abstract = {Objective
It remains unclear whether clinicians can rely on specific symptoms and signs to detect or exclude serious head and spinal injury sustained during near-shore aquatic activities. Our study investigated patients' history of present illness (HPI) and physical examination (PE) for their utility in detecting serious head and spinal injury.
Methods
We conducted a multicenter retrospective comparative analysis of adult patients who were transported from the beach in Ocean City, Maryland, to three nearby emergency departments for possible spinal injury from 2006 through 2017. Patients suspected to have any spinal injury from beach activities were eligible. We excluded patients who could not verbalize their symptoms or with insufficient emergency department records. We compared components of each patient's HPI and PE with radiologic evidence of spinal injury. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive likelihood ratios (LRs).
Results
We analyzed 278 patients with suspected spinal injury. Midline spinal tenderness was associated with increased likelihood of thoracic (LR+ 2.6) and lumbar spinal fractures (LR+ 3.5). HPI complaints of paralysis (LR+ 13.9) and sensory loss (LR+ 5.8) had strong associations with spinal cord injuries. Weakness found through PE was also associated with spinal cord injury (LR+ 5.3).
Conclusions
We identified several components of the clinical evaluation that had clinically significant association with spinal injuries from beach-related trauma. While prospective studies are needed to confirm our observations, clinicians may consider these high-risk features in patients with beach-related trauma and adjust testing and level of care appropriately.}

abstract = {A rapid and non-destructive approach for characterizing and discriminating trace evidences is one of the hotspots and focuses in forensic science. The vehicle bumpers fragments, as a trace evidence, are often found and extracted from the clothing of victims, the crashed vehicle, and the road at the scenes. Micro-laser Raman spectroscopy (MLRM) and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) has been used with principal component analysis (PCA), Multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) to propose a method for characterizing and discriminating 160 vehicle bumpers fragments from 8 manufacturers. The spectra were pre-treated by automatic baseline correction, multivariate scatter correction, standard normal variate and Savitzky-Golay algorithm. PCA was used to reduce the dimension and extraction of feature variables, while MLPNN, FDA, the several supervised pattern recognition methods, were used as algorithms of constructing classifiers. The results displayed that the discrimination ability of fusion spectra model was stronger than that of single spectra dataset. In MLPNN model, the order of it from high to low was feature-level fusion (93.5%) > data-level fusion (90.3%) > MLRM (74.2%) > ATR-FTIR (64.5%). In FDA model, the order of it from high to low was feature-level fusion (100%) > data-level fusion (93.5%) > MLRM (77.4%) > ATR-FTIR (61.3%). Fisher discriminant analysis model based on feature-level fusion dataset was the more optimal and practical method for discriminating the vehicle bumpers fragments. “Audi”, “Hyundai”, and “Chery” samples, the similar kind from different manufacturers, were also distinguished exactly, which was satisfactory. The designed method represented a potentially rapid and non-destructive approach for differentiation trace evidences in forensic science.}
