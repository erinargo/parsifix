abstract = {Three steps are required in the design of reliable nuclear power plants to be located in seismic areas. In addition to development of realistic analytical models, it is necessary to perform dynamic tests to verify the models and acquire the information needed to establish the dynamic parameters for modeling. The third and final step is to perform high level proof tests to validate analysis and test results. This report is an overview of dynamic testing methods. Testing can be performed in the laboratory or in the field. Laboratory tests are useful because a wide range of effects can be studied and test parameters are more easily controlled. Care must be exercised to insure that the laboratory situation faithfully reproduces the actual structure in such details as supports, appurtenances, appendages, and mounting methods. In general, laboratory methods permit high level excitation of structures weighing up to a few metric tons (a few facilities in the world have capabilities up to 100 t). Since actual structures of interest to nuclear power plant designers often weigh up to 10 000 t, field testing is also important. Test procedures have been developed, using portable structural vibrators, for testing structures as large as nuclear power plant containment buildings. High level tests can be performed using explosives buried in the soil to excite structures. Recent work performed by the author demonstrates that explosive tests which produce a predetermined, specified response spectrum can be conducted.}

abstract = {Summary
Glutamatergic gliotransmission provides a stimulatory input to excitatory synapses in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Here, we show that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) critically controls this process. With constitutive TNFα present, activation of astrocyte P2Y1 receptors induces localized [Ca2+]i elevations followed by glutamate release and presynaptic NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation. In preparations lacking TNFα, astrocytes respond with identical [Ca2+]i elevations but fail to induce neuromodulation. We find that TNFα specifically controls the glutamate release step of gliotransmission. In cultured astrocytes lacking TNFα glutamate exocytosis is dramatically slowed down due to altered vesicle docking. Addition of low picomolar TNFα promptly reconstitutes both normal exocytosis in culture and gliotransmission in situ. Alternatively, gliotransmission can be re-established without adding TNFα, by limiting glutamate uptake, which compensates slower release. These findings demonstrate that gliotransmission and its synaptic effects are controlled not only by astrocyte [Ca2+]i elevations but also by permissive/homeostatic factors like TNFα.

abstract = {Summary
The application of a new signal processing methodology to the analysis of epicardial array ECG signals is presented as an alternative to isopotential or isochrones mapping by the use of a zero-delay wavenumber spectrum (ZDWS) estimation technique. The methodology “explains” the array data as the sum of modulated wideband (non-sinusoidal) propagating waves projected onto the array plane and provides an accurate estimate of their number and bearing. The slowness distribution of each of the waves is then obtained by estimating their temporal spectrum. In this experimental study the effects of localized noninfarcting reversible low flow ischemia, digoxin toxicity and verapamil reversal of digoxin toxicity are quantified via the ZDWS methodology and are compared with the information that can be extracted from isopotential mapping. It is demonstrated that the ZDWS methodology permits the epicardial electric activation to be decomposed into a number of quantification parameters which possess a hierarchical “tree” structure and therefore provide a means for an objective and robust characterization of the effects of agents which alter myocardial conduction and arrhythmia generation.}

abstract = {In 1977 the World Health Organisation adopted the strategic goal “Health For All by the Year 2000”. The Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organisation has taken important steps toward the attainment of the goal, with the formulation in 1980 of a common health policy and the adoption by the Regional Committee in 1984 of 38 wide-ranging targets. The targets represent a common view of what could be Health For All in Europe and constitute a major challenge which the 33 member states in the European Region have set for themselves. Thus, the targets offer a different way or approach to the building of a local strategy. This paper reviews the extent to which Health For All and its associated targets constitute part of the planning process at district level. At the core of the paper is the results of a survey of health authorities and boards in the United Kingdom which sought details on the extent to which health planners and policy makers have embraced the concept of Health For All in applying it to a local setting. The findings of the survey are discussed within the context of whether or not Health For All should be a centrally driven or locally derived policy. And how the experience in Britain could be of value to others embarking on such a venture.}

abstract = {Analyses of the rules governing conversation have frequently pointed to the existence of a rule dictating that responses to others' communications should be relevant. Unfortunately, there have been few systematic theoretical analyses of the consequences of violations of the response relevance rule. The present research was designed to extend our previous analyses of the consequences of responsiveness in dyadic interaction to examine in detail the effects of irrelevant response on processing and retention of response content, and attributions concerning the speaker. It was argued that irrelevant responses will be processed and retained more poorly, because the preceding utterance will provide a less adequate context for their interpretation. In addition, it was argued that unresponsiveness will generally be attributed to the lack of one or more of four factors previously suggested to facilitate responsiveness: attention to the other, understanding of the preceding communication, adequate response repertoire, or motivation to be responsive—along with situational (e.g., distraction) or dispositional (e.g., incompetence) reasons for their absence. These processes were examined in the context of a political debate, in which the relevance of candidates' answers to the questions was varied. As expected, response relevance was shown to facilitate processing (as indexed by ratings of clarity and organization) and retention (both recall and recognition memory) of response content. Further, the unresponsive speaker was perceived to have less clearly understood the questions asked, to possess less knowledge of the facts and understanding of the issues concerning the questions raised, and to be less motivated to discuss the issues raised (as opposed to facilitating his self-presentational goals). Moreover, those attributions were accompanied by attributions of dispositional incompetence. Finally, the unresponsive candidate was perceived as less attractive than the responsive candidate.}

abstract = {For the last few decades, wireless communication has been facing a technological revolution. High data rate and continuous connectivity are the necessities because the technology has turned from simple voice communication to newly high interactive multimedia applications. Also, the demands for mobile devices are growing tremendously. Researchers are developing fifth-generation (5G) and beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless communication networks to fulfill the needs in the future. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can be a promising scheme to meet the demands of an enormously growing number of users, connectivity requirements, low-cost requirements, limited bandwidth requirements, and high coverage requirements for future wireless communication networks. NOMA-assisted wireless communication networks have to face several challenges along with several benefits. In the previous survey papers, the main focus of the researchers was on the concepts of NOMA, its comparison with other techniques, and issues related to NOMA. This paper presents a thorough survey on NOMA and future 5G and B5G wireless communication networks. We have arranged the paper in such a way that conveys all the aspects of 5G and B5G networks and NOMA’s application in 5G and B5G. This paper includes the study of existing survey papers, comparison with our paper, our contribution, uniqueness, and benefits of our paper. It includes requirements and technologies for 5G and B5G, channel modeling, the role of NOMA in 5G and B5G, types of NOMA, NOMA’s network architecture, mobility management (MM) in NOMA, asynchronous and synchronous operations in NOMA, energy and green aspects of NOMA in 5G and B5G, NOMA’s challenges, solutions to these challenges, NOMA’s performance indicators. This paper also includes the problems of resource allocation in 5G and B5G, role of NOMA in improving resource allocation and future research directions for next-generation wireless communication networks. This paper also discusses cloud virtualization (CV), fog networking (FN), and edge networking (EN), enterprise and industry 4.0 perspectives, the importance of standardization of NOMA, third generation partnership project (3GPP) standards for NOMA. This paper also highlights the security, blockchain aspects, practicality, and industry acceptance for NOMA in 5G and B5G.}

abstract = {This paper suggests that the growing use of computer and communications technologies has serious long and short term implications for Canadian society. Of immediate concern to a broad spectrum of Canadian society is the inadequacy of many of today's information systems to meet the test of social acceptability. In many cases, the interfaces between people and machine systems are underdeveloped, causing problems in error correction, human frustration, misuses or abuses of personal information, and, to a lesser extent, invasions of personal privacy. The paper suggests that the designers of today's machine-oriented “data processing” systems must accept a large share of the responsibility for these problems because the human component, which should be present in every “information processing” system, had frequently been overlooked. Serious long term social and economic dislocations are likely if Canada fails to align overall social and economic policies with the on-going transition towards the “information economy and society”. The paper examines the growing confrontations between labour and consumers, sellers and buyers, state and society and among the regional, national and international economies arising out of the pervasive use of computer/communications technologies. The social implications of national productivity and job exports are examined. The point is made that the social implications of the use of these technologies are much broader than privacy and encompass economic, political, legal and other social issues which cannot be resolved in isolation. It is suggested that in analysing these issues full consideration be given to technological, economic and social aspects. A number of different approaches are outlined to initiate broader discussion of these issues; among these a data protection approach. Three basic requirements are introduced in an attempt to formulate guidelines for dealing with national and corporate data protection requirements. Collaboration and co-operation among Canadian government, industry and professional associations is proposed as the most desirable approach to meeting requirements in this area. The avoidance of premature legislative measures of the kind visible in the United States is recommended. The paper concludes with a summary of unresolved data protection issues.}

The model is a two-class economy with an official and an unofficial labour market. Official income is taxed non-linearly, while unofficial income is only observable after a costly audit upon which it is taxed at an exogenous penalty rate. After characterisation of the Pareto efficient audit and tax policies, it is verified how these policies react to a higher government revenue requirement, an increase in the penalty rate, a stronger ambition to redistribute. In the two last scenarios, the effect on the marginal tax and the audit rate is shown to decompose into a government revenue effect and a substitution effect. A numerical example shows that the substitution effects are of minor importance, suggesting that first intuition about the best way for a government to cope with increased evasion opportunities— substituting auditing effort for high marginal tax rates—sketches only part of the picture.}

abstract = {Summary
The ruminant pestiviruses, bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and border disease virus (BDV) are highly successful and important pathogens which infect ruminant species worldwide. Although the serological relationships among ruminant pestiviruses require further clarification, there is growing evidence for two antigenic groups, one of which predominates in cattle and one in sheep. The success of pestiviruses stems from the ability of the non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype of the virus to cross the placenta and establish a persistent infection (PI) in the developing foetus. This biotype should be regarded as the ‘normal’ biotype with the cytopathic (CP) biotype being an abnormal virus that is usually isolated only from PI animals dying from mucosal disease. Recent molecular evidence points to CP viruses arising from their NCP counterparts by recombination events that include the insertion of host RNA and/or the duplication of viral RNA sequences. However, the biological mechanism through which CP viruses kill cells remains unknown. Virtually all CP and NCP viruses cause only mild, transient clinical symptoms in healthy adult animals and stimulate a protective immune response. Despite the urgent requirement for a safe, effective vaccine, there is still no commercial vaccine that has been shown to immunize dams so that foetal infection is prevented. In the absence of an effective vaccine, reliable diagnostic techniques are essential to implement effective control measures. There is now a range of monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for identifying PI or convalescent animals. These tests are specific, rapid, sensitive and reliable but may themselves become redundant as they are superceded by ever-increasing molecular biology-based techniques.}

abstract = {At present, fewer than 10% of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts prehospital or in hospitals outside special care units result in survival without brain damage. Minimizing response times and optimizing CPR performance would improve results. A breakthrough, however, can be expected to occur only when cerebral resuscitation research has achieved consistent conscious survival after normothermic cardiac arrest (no flow) times of not only five minutes but up to ten minutes. Most cerebral neurons and cardiac myocytes tolerate normothermic ischemic anoxia of up to 20 minutes. Particularly vulnerable neurons die, in part, because of the complex secondary postreflow derangements in vital organs (the postresuscitation syndrome) which can be mitigated. Brain-orientation of CPR led to the cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) system of basic, advanced, and prolonged life support. In large animal models with cardiac arrest of 10 to 15 minutes, external CPR, life support of at least three days, and outcome evaluation, the numbers of conscious survivors (although not with normal brain histology) have been increased with more effective reperfusion by open-chest CPR or emergency cardiopulmonary bypass, an early hypertensive bout, early postarrest calcium entry blocker therapy, or mild cerebral hypothermia (34 C) immediately following cardiac arrest. More than ten drug treatments evaluated have not reproducibly mitigated brain damage in such animal models. Controlled clinical trials of novel CPCR treatments reveal feasibility and side effects but, in the absence of a breakthrough effect, may not discriminate between a treatment's ability to mitigate brain damage in selected cases and the absence of any treatment effect. More intensified, coordinated, multicenter cerebral resuscitation research is justified.}

abstract = {Transport of contaminants was analyzed for dual-porosity formations in which advection occurs only through fractures, but contaminants can diffuse into the rock matrix porosity. Transport was shown to occur in three distinct regimes: fracture, dual-porosity and total porosity transport. In the fracture transport regime, contaminant transport is controlled by fracture porosity alone. This was shown to end too quickly to have any significance for nuclear waste repositories like the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Dual-porosity transport, in which contaminants are predominantly inside the matrix porosity and in the process of diffusing deeper into the rock, was shown to be controlled by a single formation parameter, called here the transport length, which can be estimated from tracer tests. Although conventional two-well tracer tests yield ambiguous values for fracture width and porosity, they provide useable estimates of the transport length. The effect on tracer tests of random heterogeneity and anisotropy in the formation was analyzed; the arithmetic mean of inferred values from different tests is the correct average for the transport length and the harmonic mean is the correct average for the kinematic porosity. Data were analyzed from nine tracer tests in a dual-porosity dolomite in the Culebra formation above the WIPP repository, including one test repeated at a different flow rate. The effect of dual-porosity on the mean transport rate of contaminants potentially leaking from the WIPP repository was shown to be negligible. Thus, for off-site transport at the WIPP, the formation is adequately modeled as a single-porosity, matrix-only medium.}

Ischemic heart disease and contributing risk factors such as the hyperlipoproteinemic states affect a great percentage of the general population. Because these disease processes can effectively place patients at risk for a life-threatening event, every health care provider must be knowledgeable, disciplined to take a thorough medical history, and prepared for emergency situations that may arise in the clinical practice of dentistry. A proactive approach to identification of risk factors and to primary prevention of ischemic heart disease not only helps to lengthen and improve the quality of patient’s lives, but also ensures that necessary modifications of treatment reflect each patient’s medical and pharmacologic status.}

The new capabilities of such systems give them the ability to collect and index a huge amount of private information about each individual. Next-generation systems have to solve this issue in order to obtain the users’ acceptance. Therefore, there is a need for mechanisms or tools to protect and preserve people’s privacy.

This chapter discusses the piezoelectric crystal detectors for environmental pollutants. A block diagram of the simplest typical experimental setup is presented. The piezoelectric crystal is housed in the detector cell and driven by a low frequency transistor oscillator. The frequency of the crystal is monitored by a frequency counter modified by a digital-to-analog converter. Piezoelectric detectors are used for the detection of dissolved gases in aqueous solutions. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are determined utilizing gas-permeable membranes to isolate the crystal from the solution. The catalytic effect of bromide on the oxidation of iodine to iodate by permanganate in acidic medium is utilized for the determination of bromide with a piezoelectric crystal detector. Iodide in solution is determined by means of a piezoelectric crystal with silver electrodes connected to a normal TTL oscillator. The effect of metal ions on a piezoelectric crystal in aqueous solution and the adsorptive determination of Fe(III) as phosphate is studied.}

The complex task adopted for these experiments consisted of (a) a centrally located high priority pointer following task which had to be performed continuously and (b) the response to the onset of any one of four lights two of which were situated in front of the subject and two on his periphery of vision. The task was performed over a period of 36 minutes. Our results indicate that although performance in the infrasound condition does not suffer significant decrements in either the primary task or the central and peripheral components of the secondary task, the effects through time, both within the infrasound condition and in relation to the control, produce changes which are of a different nature to those of audible noise. In audible noise performance is maintained through time, whereas with infrasound and alcohol it appears to be degraded.}

abstract = {Urban mass fires are relatively infrequent events which have historically resulted in immense losses of life and property. Mass fires often have occurred as the result of natural disasters or warfare. The development of nuclear weapons has increased the likelihood of urban mass fires due to the high level of thermal radiation generated by a nuclear detonation. There are a large number of wind-fire interactions which are important in the initiation, development, and spread of these large fires. Dramatic examples include the extremely high winds and fire whirls which are often generated by such fires. Other effects such as wind-aided fire spread, fire brand spotting, and the effects of the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer can contribute significantly to the growth and behavior of mass fires. In this review characteristics of the two types of mass fire—fire storm and conflagration—are discussed. Brief histories of urban mass fire and research efforts on this topic are given. Models which have been developed to predict the initiation, development, spread, and behavior of mass fires following the detonation of a nuclear device in an urban environment are summarized. The current understanding of the fire processes which are believed to control mass fire behavior are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on the wind-fire interactions mentioned in the last paragraph. This discussion forms the basis for an analysis of the effectiveness of existing models for mass fire growth and behavior. It is concluded that the understanding of the important physical processes is incomplete and that models for mass fire development and behavior are likely to be subject to large and uncharacterized errors. The possibility of improving our understanding of the underlying physical and chemical processes utilizing reduced-scale experiments is assessed.}

Reliability problems have historically been a major cause of poor performance for desalination plants. The emphasis of this paper is on the importance of availability modeling methodology to MSF desalination plant reliability problems by providing a context in which the effect of unit unavailability can be quantified. An assessment is made of failures and outages which impact the availability of MSF desalination plants. Limited fault tree logic for system failures is developed and reliability data from the literature is incorporated, where possible. The impact of other water supply system failures on the reliability requirements of the desalination plant is quantified as are the effects of increased average water system demands. The single largest influence on the effective capacity of a water supply system based on MSF desalination of sea water is found to be the availability and maintainability of the desalination plant. Forced outages as a result of equipment failure are significant, but other dominant contributions to unit unavailability include externally caused problems, such as silting. The design configuration of the desalination plant is also found to have an impact on the acceptability of water supply system performance.}
