abstract = {This study presents the application of integer goal programming to the facility location and products allocation problem with multiple, competing objectives. The proposed model describes the situation in which a firm evaluates six potential production plant location sites in four states that would serve four distribution centers. The model considers multiple objectives including several qualitative factors of location analysis and cost-related objectives have been considered in the model. The result of the model indicates that integer goal programming is one of the promising techniques which are applicable to the real-world location/allocation problems.}

abstract = {Radiocesium isotopes were released into the environment in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, which resulted from the massive Tohoku earthquake in March 2011. Lake Inba is located in Chiba Prefecture about 200 km from the FDNPP site and the lake was contaminated by radioactivity from the accident. The present work was carried out in order to investigate the vertical distributions and accumulations of radiocesium and Pu in sediment cores collected during 2011–2015, and to study the migration behaviors of radiocesium and Pu isotopes in the sediments. The observed 134Cs/137Cs activity ratios in the core samples were approximately 1 (decay-corrected to 15 March, 2011), suggesting that sediment samples were contaminated by the FDNPP-released radiocesium. Compared with radiocesium inventories in soil in the area surrounding the Lake Inba, the calculated higher radiocesium inventories of the collected sediment cores indicated that most of the radiocesium was subsequently accumulated in the lake, and that the radiocesium input by atmospheric deposition and input from surrounding soil were greater than the output of the radiocesium. The 239+240Pu activities in the sediments were all within the background level seen before the accident. The atom ratios of 240Pu/239Pu ranged from 0.175 to 0.210, suggesting that Pu originated from global stratospheric fallout rather than from the FDNPP accident.}

Crime is produced through offenders supplying time in search of victims and victims demanding to expose themselves to the environment. A model is set up in which the crime rate, the probability of being a victim per unit of exposure time, and the probability of finding a victim per unit of offenders' search time are simultaneously determined. The model leads us to distinguish the “real” crime rate (the probability of being a victim per unit of exposure time) from the “nominal” crime rate (the number of crimes per capita). The nominal crime rate can be inversely related to the real crime rate.}

abstract = {The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) has increased the appetite for the energy efficient wireless infrastructures. Most of the IoT devices are inherently resource constrained and heterogeneous in respect of their traffic demand. Moreover, these devices need to be made adaptable to the varying environmental conditions. However, existing traffic scheduling and duty cycling algorithms lack the capability to meet the dynamic service quality requirements of IoT applications with variable context information. Specifically, they are infeasible for IoT use-cases where multi-hop communication is required. This paper strives to realize efficient resource allocation to the Wi-Fi based IoT devices in multi-hop IoT infrastructures. Firstly, IoT applications are characterized as per their heterogeneous traffic demand and mapped to the distinct weighted quality classes. Then, context awareness is introduced for IoT devices and an optimization model constrained by their service quality requirements and context priorities is presented. Further, an energy efficient context aware traffic scheduling (EE-CATS) algorithm is proposed wherein the convergence of model is specified by a sub-gradient projection method. The EE-CATS algorithm efficiently allocates resources to multi-hop IoT devices and reduce their total awake time by employing adaptive duty cycling. The performance evaluation is done for various IoT use-cases through simulations in Network Simulator (ns-2) and testbed implementation in Contiki operating system. The results suggest substantial improvements in the energy efficiency of IoT devices while ensuring their dynamic service requirements. In addition, the proposed algorithm minimizes the end-to-end delays in overall IoT networks.}

abstract = {In combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, photodynamic therapy can induce robust immune responses capable of preventing local tumor recurrence and delaying the growth of distant, untreated disease (ie. the abscopal effect). Previously, we found that repeated photodynamic therapy (R-PDT) using porphyrin lipoprotein (PLP) as a photosensitizer, without the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, can induce the abscopal effect. To understand why PLP mediated R-PDT alone can induce the abscopal effect, and how the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor can further strengthen the abscopal effect, we investigated the broader immune mechanisms facilitated by R-PDT and combination R-PDT + anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (αPD-1) in a highly aggressive, subcutaneous AE17-OVA mesothelioma dual tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. We found a 46.64-fold and 61.33-fold increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) after R-PDT and combination R-PDT + αPD-1 relative to PBS respectively, suggesting broad innate immune activation. There was a greater propensity for antigen presentation in the spleen and distal, non-irradiated tumor draining lymph nodes, as dendritic cells and macrophages had increased expression of MHC class II, CD80, and CD86, after R-PDT and combination R-PDT + αPD-1. Concurrently, there was a shift in the proportions of CD4+ T cell subsets in the spleen, and an increase in the frequency of CD8+ T cells in the distal, non-irradiated tumor draining lymph nodes. While R-PDT had an acceptable safety profile, combination R-PDT + αPD-1 induced 1.26-fold higher serum potassium and 1.33-fold phosphorus, suggestive of mild laboratory tumor lysis syndrome. Histology revealed an absence of gross inflammation in critical organs after R-PDT and combination R-PDT + αPD-1 relative to PBS-treated mice. Taken together, our findings shed light on how the abscopal effect can be induced by PDT and strengthened by combination R-PDT + αPD-1, and suggests minimal toxicities after R-PDT.}

abstract = {The traditional anaerobic sewage treatment facilities are unsuitable for the widely uncontrolled spread of antibiotic residues in hospital or on livestock farm, which have raised the risk levels of high concentrations of antibiotic residues leakages and seriously threatened the aquatic ecology safeties. Thus, to develop an effective adsorbent with safe, low cost, and high firmly adsorptive capacity are imminent required. In this investigated, a self-templating hydrothermal alkali fore-modified & ultrasonic treatment was developed to achieve the highly adsorptive capacity and low desorption rate of biochar. As expected, the prepared biochar adsorbents present plenty of surface functional groups and micro pores. The BET value is raised up 1452 cm2·g−1 for biochar treated by the associated alkali fore-modified and ultrasonic treatment (UFB), whereas it is only 415.8 cm2·g−1 for the biochar treated by traditional carbonization (AC) and 1205 cm2·g−1 for the biochar by further hydrothermal alkali fore-modification (FB). Congruously, UFB exhibits the removal abilities of 397.70 mg·g−1 of levofloxacin (LEV) and 320.99 mg·g−1 of chlorotetracycline (CTC), 3.5–6.3 times absorbability towards familiar antibiotics than traditional biochar. Moreover, the corresponding the lowest desorption of 1.30 mg·g−1 (LEV) and 0.43 mg·g−1 (CTC) mg·g−1 by UFB have been confirmed. Meanwhile, Furthermore, both the adsorption and desorption mechanisms have been addressed by kinetic studies, pore width distributions, XPS and FTIR surveys. It is proposed the fore-modified treatment is more helpful for carbon functionalization while the ultrasonic treatment dedicates to the largely microporous structures. Consequently, the adsorption's capacity and stability of UFB adsorbents is large promoted due to its more micro- and meso-porous structure through a jointly hydrothermal alkali fore-modified and ultrasonic treatment. The present investigation will provide a novel alternative preparation strategy of the highly efficient adsorbent for emergency medical wastewater treatment.}

To date, the innate cellular and molecular mechanism(s) orchestrating the HDM-induced allergic inflammation remains partially deciphered. Understanding the kaleidoscope of HDM-induced innate immune responses is hampered by (1) the large complexity of the HDM allergome with very diverse functional bioreactivities, (2) the perpetual presence of microbial compounds (at least LPS, β-glucan, chitin) promoting as well pro-Th2 innate signaling pathways and (3) multiple cross-talks involving structural, neuronal and immune cells. The present review provides an update on the innate immune properties, identified so far, of multiple HDM allergen groups. Experimental evidence highlights the importance of HDM allergens displaying protease or lipid-binding activities on the initiation of the allergic responses. Specifically, group 1 HDM cysteine proteases are considered as the key initiators of the allergic response through their capacities to impair the epithelial barrier integrity, to stimulate the release of pro-Th2 danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in epithelial cells, to produce super-active forms of IL-33 alarmin and to mature thrombin leading to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Remarkably, the recently evidenced primary sensing of cysteine protease allergens by nociceptive neurons confirms the critical role of this HDM allergen group in the early events leading to Th2 differentiation.}

Senataxin-associated exonuclease (San1) is a protein that interacts with Senataxin (SETX), a helicase resolving R-loops. It remains unknown if R-loops-induced DNA damage plays a role in the heart, especially in the proliferative neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs). San1−/− mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. The newborn San1−/− mice show no overt phenotype, but their hearts were smaller with larger, yet fewer CMs. CM proliferation was impaired with reduced cell cycle-related transcripts and proteins. S9.6 staining revealed that excessive R-loops accumulated in the nucleus of neonatal San1−/− CMs. Increased γH2AX staining on newborn and adult heart sections exhibited increased DNA damage. Similarly, San1−/− AC16-cardiomyocytes showed cumulative R-loops and DNA damage, leading to the activation of cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATR and PARP1 hyperactivity, arresting G2/M cell-cycle and CM proliferation. Together, the present study uncovers an essential role of San1 in resolving excessive R-loops that lead to DNA damage and repressing CM proliferation, providing new insights into a novel biological function of San1 in the neonatal heart. San1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of hypoplastic cardiac disorders.}

This approach allows parameters to be automatically selected from a database and optimally combined to form decision rules, allowing both the structure and parameters of the decision rules to evolve. The generated decision rules support capacity expansion activities by clearly providing guidance to adjust the expansion level and timing according to the changing environment. The proposed approach was applied to a waste-to-energy system, to flexibly expand capacity under uncertainty. The empirical results demonstrate that the decision rules generated by our proposed approach improved system performance in terms of expected net present value, relative to decision rules generated by a method based on differential evolution algorithm. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under changes to the major assumptions, and results indicated that the generated decision rule can guide capacity expansion under different situations.}

Thus, traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) approaches cannot keep up with rapidly evolving application requirements. This challenge has motivated the adoption of the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept to adapt the automation into network services management. By automating network and service management, ZSM offers efficiency to control network resources and enhance network performance visibility. The ultimate target of the ZSM concept is to enable an autonomous network system capable of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization based on service-level policies and rules without human intervention. Thus, the paper focuses on conducting a comprehensive survey of E2E ZSM architecture and solutions for 5G and beyond networks. The article begins by presenting the fundamental ZSM architecture and its essential components and interfaces. Then, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for key technical areas, i.e., ZSM automation, cross-domain E2E service lifecycle management, and security aspects, are presented. Furthermore, the paper contains a summary of recent standardization efforts and research projects towards the ZSM realization in 5G and beyond networks. Finally, several lessons learned from the literature and open research problems related to ZSM realization are also discussed in this paper.}

abstract = {Buprenorphine-based medications were first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2002 for the treatment of opioid dependence, or opioid use disorder (OUD) as the condition is presently known. This regulatory milestone was the outcome of 36 years of research and development, which also led to the development and approval of several other new buprenorphine-based medications. In this short review, we first describe the discovery and early development stages of buprenorphine. Second, we review key steps that led to the development of buprenorphine as a drug product. Third, we explain the regulatory approval of several buprenorphine-based medications for the treatment of OUD. We also discuss these developments in the context of the evolution of regulations and policies that have progressively improved OUD treatment availability and efficacy, although challenges remain in removing system-level, provider-level, and local-level barriers to quality treatment, to integrating OUD treatment into routine care and other settings, to reducing disparities in access to treatment, and to optimizing person-centered outcomes.}

What methods can be used to assess and compare the environmental practices and performance of different companies?

The business practices and performances were assessed using the best practice model adopted in the Australian Manufacturers Council study (AMC, November 1994, Melbourne, 112pp.). The environmental practices and performance of the companies were assessed based on a five stage framework of business response to environmental issues presented here. A strong correlation was observed between environmental performance and business practices (correlation coefficient, r = 0.85, p < 0.05). The company closest to best practice had a strong focus on quality, efficiency and elimination of waste, well-developed strategy, good teamwork and a high level of commitment and also had the highest score for environmental performance. The company with poorest score for its business practices had the poorest environmental performance, with the remaining companies lying between on both scores. There was no significant correlation between business performance outcomes and environmental performance.}

The crucial question for policymakers seems to be ignored: Can interdiction succeed as a means to control drug traffic and use? A dynamic model of the illegal drug business indicates that feedback mechanisms exist that will thwart interdiction efforts by stabilizing price and street supply. The model suggests that efforts to control drug traffic and disrupt international drug cartel operations should concentrate on money flows and reduction of demand. It also suggests how to maximize the effect of interdiction, should that still be used as a strategy.}

The method was validated according to the requirements of ISO 15189. A simple and fast liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with De-Tox Tube-A was performed leading to better recovery of molecules in urine than in blood samples. Depending on the compound, the limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.01 to 0.10 ng/mL and from 0.02 to 0.05 ng/mL in whole blood and urine, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the range 0.5–50.0 ng/mL and the limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.10 to 0.40 ng/mL in blood. Internal quality controls at 1 and 40 ng/mL showed intra-day and between-day precision and accuracy bias below 10% in urine and 15% in blood. The method was applied to the screening of 211 urine samples from patients admitted in emergency or addiction departments. The presence of legal fentanyl analogues in 5 urine samples was justified by their therapeutic use as analgesics. Only one patient was concerned by fentanyl misuse and addiction whereas no illegal SO was detected. This study is not in favor of a huge misuse of SO in the Lorraine region.}

In the presence of nitroaromatic vapors, the fluorescence of the material was found to decrease due to the adsorption of nitroaromatic molecules on its specific adsorption sites. The sensor exhibited a large sensitivity to TNT or DNT at their vapor pressures (respectively 6 and 148ppbv) and the detection threshold was evaluated on a laboratory test setup and was found to be 0.75ppbv for TNT. Moreover, the detector demonstrated no loss of performance in the presence of humidity or interfering compounds. All the tests led to the conclusion that the sensor fulfills the main requirements for the identification of suspect luggage, forensic analyses or battlefields clearing.}

Amplified by the speed and scope of social media, they can quickly reach millions of people and result in a wide range of marketplace deceptions. However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn. We then accumulate and present knowledge on the strategies and mechanisms to safeguard against deepfake-based marketplace deception. Furthermore, we uncover and report the various legitimate opportunities offered by this new technology. Finally, we present an agenda for future research in this emergent and highly critical area.}

Phytoplankton samples were taken monthly at upstream, aquaculture, and downstream locations during August 2008 to November 2011. The phytoplankton community was primarily diatoms and cryptophytes. Diatom biomass was correlated with greater mixing depth, while cryptophyte biomass was correlated with higher dissolved nutrients. Phytoplankton biomass was characterized by date, season and year, and this information was used to test spatial differences between upstream, farm and downstream locations. There was no significant difference in chlorophyte, chrysophyte or dinoflagellate biomass spatially. Upstream sites (US) had higher diatom biomass in the fall (US-DS=329mg/m3). Downstream sites (DS) had higher cryptophyte biomass in the summer (DS-US=241mg/m3) and higher cyanobacteria biomass in the fall (DS-US=15mg/m3). Spatial trends in diatoms, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria between upstream and downstream locations were found to be significantly related to distance downstream, but failed to provide evidence of a fish farm effect. There was far greater inter-annual variability than spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass of Lake Diefenbaker, a lake prone to flooding and drought. For instance, flooding in 2011 resulted in elevated suspended solids, nutrient concentrations, and algal biomass (particularly cryptophytes and dinoflagellates) due to a La Niňa winter. Flood inputs of suspended solids to Lake Diefenbaker favour low-light adapted taxa (e.g., Rhodomonas minuta Skuja) over potentially toxic cyanobacteria.}

abstract = {Shingleback lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) are among the most trafficked native fauna from Australia in the illegal pet trade. There are four morphologically recognised subspecies of shinglebacks, all with differing overseas market values. Shinglebacks from different geographic locales are often trafficked and housed together, which may complicate identifying the State jurisdiction where the poaching event occurred. Additionally, shinglebacks can be housed and trafficked with other species within the same genus, which may complicate DNA analysis, especially in scenarios where indirect evidence (e.g. swabs, faeces) is taken for analysis. In this study, a forensic genetic toolkit was designed and validated to target shingleback DNA for species identification and geographic origin. To do this, field sampling across Australia was conducted to expand the phylogeographic sampling of shinglebacks across their species range and include populations suspected to be poaching hotspots. A commonly used universal reptile primer set (ND4/LEU) was then validated for use in forensic casework related to the genus Tiliqua. Two additional ND4 primer sets were designed and validated. The first primer set was designed and demonstrated to preferentially amplify an ∼510 bp region of the genus Tiliqua over other reptiles and builds on existing data to expand the available phylogeographic database. The second primer set was designed and demonstrated to solely amplify an ∼220 bp region of T. rugosa ND4 over any other reptile species. Through the validation process, all primers were demonstrated to amplify T. rugosa DNA from a variety of sample types (e.g. degraded, low quality and mixed). Two of the primer sets were able to distinguish the genetic lineage of T. rugosa from the phylogeographic database. This work provides the first forensically validated toolkit and phylogeographic genetic database for Squatmate lizards.}

Our approach is to use the paradigm of self-stabilization in distributed fault tolerance. We provide time complexity analysis of the algorithms in terms of the number of rounds needed for the algorithm to stabilize after a topology change, where a round is defined as a period of time in which each node in the system receives beacon messages from all its neighbors. In any ad hoc network, the participating nodes periodically transmit beacon messages for message transmission as well as to maintain the knowledge of the local topology at the node; as a result the nodes get the information about its neighbor nodes synchronously (at specific time intervals). Thus, the paradigm to analyze the complexity of the self-stabilizing algorithms in the context of ad hoc networks is very different from the traditional concept of adversary oracle used in proving the convergence and correctness of self-stabilizing distributed algorithms in general.}

We show that sanctions which do not work instantaneously (ie there is neither political compliance nor economic adjustment) can work in the long run, but only if the learning effect dominates the adjustment effect. A sufficient condition for ultimate compliance is that (potential) sanction damage that cannot be avoided by adjustment in the long run exceeds the yield of misconduct.}

This work presents fully-coupled thermo-poroelastic solutions for transversely isotropic medium, incorporating three novel components: (a) thermo-osmosis, thermal-filtration, and heat sink due to fluid dilation; (b) transient heat transfer between source/sink and the target layer; and (c) vertical confinement governed by seal rock stiffness. The first component (a) is found to be most substantial subsequent to source/sink implementation, generating considerable pore pressures that dissipate over time. The ratio of fluid bulk module (Kf) to that of the solid phase (Ks) governs the importance of the aforementioned short-term thermal effects (inconsequential heat sink due to fluid dilation for Kf/Ks < 0.05). Stress paths incorporating component (a) show notably higher (3–4 times) deviatoric stresses under heating, and a more complex behavior under cooling compared to traditional thermo-poroelasticity. The second component (b) is crucial at early times, and can generate early failure that otherwise is impossible to capture using conventional solutions. The third component (c) captures thermal-induced dilation prior to compaction adjacent to source, while conventional plane strain overlooks the former behavior at this critical location.}

abstract = {Tritium (3H) is one of the hardest isotopes to detect by most traditional radiometric means due to the low energy of the β− emission, (β−MEAN 5.67 keV, β−MAX 18.59 keV). The high mobility of the isotope in groundwater environments and subsequent entry into the food chain constitutes a radiation safety risk justifying assessment. Accordingly, there is a need to measure 3H accurately and efficiently, often in low concentrations, both in laboratory settings and on-line flow-cells for potential in situ measurement requirements. This review covers technologies developed to assess aqueous tritium-containing samples. Of the techniques reviewed, liquid scintillation counting (LSC) is the best performing means of aqueous 3H detection with a minimal detectable activity of 6 × 10−4 Bq L−1 for a 195-min counting time. LSC is also established as the industry standard and is the basis of the first, commercially-available, real-time 3H detection system. This review also covers the other means described in literature for the detection of tritium in aqueous samples, including the use of plastic and inorganic scintillators, imaging plates, both in off-line and on-line modes of operation. Whilst most of these techniques lag LSC in terms of technological maturity, several offer detection sensitivities that could rival LSC, without the need for the sample preparation and waste generation associated with LSC, and providing real-time in situ measurements.}

Several approaches ranging from detoxification, behavioral therapy, and the use of antagonists or drugs with counter effects are currently being applied for its management. Amongst these, drug therapy is the mainstay for some drug abuse incidences, as is in place specifically for opioid abuse or alcohol dependence. The severity of the havocs observed with the SUDs has triggered constant interest in the discovery and development of novel medications as well as suitable or most appropriate methods for the delivery of these agents. The chronic need of such drugs in users warrants the need for their prolonged or sustained systemic availability. Further, the need to improve patient tolerance to medication, limit invasive drug use and overall treatment outcome are pertinent considerations for embracing sustained release designs for medications used in managing SUDs. This review aims to provide an overview on up-to-date advances made with regards to sustained delivery systems for the drugs for treatment of different types of SUDs such as opioid, alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and cannabis use disorders. The clinical relevance, promises and the limitations of deployed sustained release approaches along with future opportunities are discussed.}

At present, mobile users are getting familiar with the latest 5G networks, and the discussion for the next generation of Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks has already been initiated. It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks. This work provides a basis for privacy aspects that will significantly impact peoples’ daily lives when using these future networks.}

Allowing collusion is costly because the dishonest auditors will erode the deterrence of the punishment. We show that the principal may find it optimal to allow collusion. When the punishment is high enough, allowing collusion is always optimal. We also study how collusion is optimally managed in different environments.}

As such, the general public writ-large has had to wrestle with the colonization of publicly funded space, and the outcomes to each of our personal lives as a result of the massive harvesting and storing of our data, and the potential machine learning and processing applied to that data. Facebook, once content to harvest our data through its website, cookies, and apps on mobile phones and computers, has now planned to follow us more deeply into the Commons by developing new mapping technology combined with smart camera equipped Augmented Reality (AR) eyeglasses, that will track, render and record the Commons—and us with it. The resulting data will privately benefit Facebook's continued goal to expand its worldwide reach and growth. In this paper, we examine the ethical implications of Facebook's Project Aria research pilot through the perspectives of Responsible Innovation, comparing both existing understandings of Responsible Research and Innovation and Facebook's own Responsible Innovation Principles; we contextualise Project Aria within the Commons through applying current social multi-dimensional communications theory to understand the extensive socio-technological implications of Project Aria within society and culture; and we address the potentially serious consequences of the Facebook Project Aria experiment, inspiring countless other companies to shift their focus to compete with Project Aria, or beat it to the consumer marketplace.}

abstract = {A set of equations incorporating alternative explanations of municipal expenditures is estimated using data from Cleveland, Ohio. One explanation is the determinants of demand or external theory, the second is the bureaucratic or internal explanation, and the third is a political or electoral approach. This latter view accepts the notion that mayors, department heads and financial officers may behave in a bureaucratic fashion. However, the political explanation contends that mayors are elected to and remain in office on their ability to provide the services desired by their constituents. This political explanation was tested by including variables measuring the different budgetary strategies followed by the three post-World War II municipal administraitons in Cleveland. These differences refer to each administration's decisions on the overall size of the public sector and to the different expenditure priorities within this total budget. Additional variables were included to represent the determinants model, e.g., crime rates, population, and income and the bureaucratic model, e.g., a constant incremental increase and changes in total revenues. The results suggest that all three explanations have some validity as well as some shortcomings. Changes in budgetary strategies could be associated with changes in administrations for some expenditures. At the same time, the demand-related variables were significant in many equations, as was the change in total revenue variable. One conclusion from these results is that administrations and elections are important and that the next step is to relate these changes directly to the electoral process.}

With billions of devices connected, most of the current IoT systems are using centralized cloud-based data sharing systems, which will be difficult to scale up to meet the demands of future IoT systems. The involvement of such a third-party service provider requires also trust from both the sensor owner and sensor data user. Moreover, fees need to be paid for their services. To tackle both the scalability and trust issues and to automatize the payments, this paper presents a blockchain-based marketplace for sharing of the IoT data. We also use a proxy re-encryption scheme for transferring the data securely and anonymously, from data producer to the consumer. The system stores the IoT data in cloud storage after encryption. To share the collected IoT data, the system establishes runtime dynamic smart contracts between the sensor and data consumer without the involvement of a trusted third-party. It also uses a very efficient proxy re-encryption scheme which allows that the data is only visible by the owner and the person present in the smart contract. This novel combination of smart contracts with proxy re-encryption provides an efficient, fast and secure platform for storing, trading and managing sensor data. The proposed system is implemented using off-the-shelf IoT sensors and computer devices. We also analyze the performance of our hybrid system by using the permission-less Ethereum blockchain and compare it to the IBM Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain.}

abstract = {Significant controversy over the environmental and public health impact of depleted uranium use in the Gulf War and the war in the Balkans has prompted the investigation and use of other materials including heavy metal tungsten alloys (HMTAs) as nontoxic alternatives. Interest in the health effects of HMTAs has peaked since the recent discovery that rats intramuscularly implanted with pellets containing 91.1% tungsten/6% nickel/2.9% cobalt rapidly developed aggressive metastatic tumors at the implantation site. Very little is known, however, regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with the effects of inhalation exposure to HMTAs despite the recognized risk of this route of exposure to military personnel. In the current study military-relevant metal powder mixtures consisting of 92% tungsten/5% nickel/3% cobalt (WNiCo) and 92% tungsten/5% nickel/3% iron (WNiFe), pure metals, or vehicle (saline) were instilled intratracheally in rats. Pulmonary toxicity was assessed by cytologic analysis, lactate dehydrogenase activity, albumin content, and inflammatory cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 24h after instillation. The expression of 84 stress and toxicity-related genes was profiled in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage cells using real-time quantitative PCR arrays, and in vitro assays were performed to measure the oxidative burst response and phagocytosis by lung macrophages. Results from this study determined that exposure to WNiCo and WNiFe induces pulmonary inflammation and altered expression of genes associated with oxidative and metabolic stress and toxicity. Inhalation exposure to both HMTAs likely causes lung injury by inducing macrophage activation, neutrophilia, and the generation of toxic oxygen radicals.}

The EM result is driven primarily by majority but not full control transactions, and by risky acquirers. We also find evidence of wealth transfer from acquirers’ bondholders to shareholders in EM acquisitions, which is stronger when transactions result in majority but not full control of the target or when acquirers are rated sub-investment grade. We attribute the rise in the U.S. bidders’ credit risk around announcements of majority but not full control EM acquisitions to the weaker legal environment and creditor protection in the target nation relative to those in the U.S.}

Accurate distributed estimation of the position of network nodes is essential for many applications, including localization, geographic routing, and vehicular networks. When nodes are mobile and their mobility pattern is unknown, there are not yet adequate techniques to achieve high accuracy and low estimation errors. In this paper, a new distributed estimator of the position of mobile nodes is proposed. No model of the mobility is assumed. The estimator combines heterogeneous information coming from pre-existing ranging, speed, and angular measurements, which is jointly fused by an optimization problem where the squared mean and variance of the localization error is minimized. Challenges of this optimization are the characterization of the moments of the noises that affect the measurements. The estimator is distributed in that it requires only local processing and communication among the nodes of the network. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator outperforms traditional approaches based on the extended Kalman filter.}

The level of the core crest is an essential parameter since temporary overtopping of the core has been discussed in Scandinavia as a possible way of coping with extreme floods. Detection methods of the time rate of change in soil characteristics and the exact location of the core crest and its variability would be valuable for analyses of the risk of internal erosion and planning of remedial measures. A system based on ground penetrating radar with multiple antennas has been developed partly to detect the core crest. The system operates with an accuracy significantly higher than single-antenna systems. Crosshole electromagnetic tomography supplies information on the porosity variation in the plane analyzed. In particular, time changes in porosity indicate that internal erosion is a serious problem.}

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To observe the impact of Xinfeng capsule (XFC) on cardiovascular function in adjuvant arthritis (AA) model rats and investigate the mechanism though toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κβ) signaling pathway.
METHODS
Seventy rats were randomly divided into seven groups: normal control (NC), model control (MC), tripterygium glycosides tablet (TPT), methotrexate (MTX), high, moderate and low dose XFC group. The administration began from day 19 after modeling for 30 day. Paw swelling, arthritic index (AI), cardiac function indexes and myocardial pathological pattern were detected. The expression of TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor (MyD) 88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF) 6, NF-κβ, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) proteins in myocardial tissue were determined by western blot method.
RESULTS
Paw swelling and AI in MC group increased in MC group (P < 0.01), and decreased in high and moderate dose XFC groups (P < 0.01 or P > 0.05). Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), heart rate (HR) were elevated in MC group (P < 0.01), and ± dp/dtmax and CI were reduced (P < 0.01); while LVSP, LVEDP and HR declined and ±dp/dtmax, CI improved in high dose XFC group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). LVSP in high dose XFC group were reduced more than other treatment groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The improvements on LVEDP, dp/dt-max were superior to MTX and low dose XFC group, and the improvement on CI was better than low dose XFC group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Myocardial fibers arranged irregular in MC group with intracellular edema and mitochondria damage. The modifications on myocardial structural were shown in each treatment group, but more prominent in TPT, high and moderate dose XFC group. The proteins of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, NF-κβ, TNF-α were highly expressed in MC group, and those proteins declined in high and moderate dose XFC group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). High dose XFC group was superior to MTX and low dose XFC group on reducing TLR4, NF-κβ, TNF-α (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION
XFC can not only inhibit the excessive activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and the increased inflammatory mediators, but also reduce the damage of myocardial tissue and cells.}

abstract = {Purpose
Radiology departments around the world have been faced with the challenge to adapt, and recover to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is part of a worldwide survey of radiologists' responses to COVID-19 in 18 different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to analyze the changes made in international radiology departments and practices in response to the pandemic.
Methods
The 18-item survey was sent via email from April to May 2020 to radiologists in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America to assess their response to COVID-19. Our survey included questions regarding imaging, workforce adjustments, testing availability, staff and patient safety, research and education, and infrastructure availability.
Results
Twenty-eight survey responses were reviewed. Of the 28 respondents, 42.9% have shortages of infrastructure and 78.6% responded that COVID-19 testing was available. Regarding the use of Chest CT in COVID-19 patients, 28.6% respondents used Chest CT as screening for COVID-19. For staff safety, interventions included encouraging use of masks in patient encounters, social distancing and PPE training. To cope with their education and research mission, radiology departments are doing online lectures, reducing the number of residents in rotations, and postponing any non-urgent activities.
Conclusion
In conclusion, there are disparities in infrastructure, research, and educational initiatives during COVID-19 which also provides opportunity for the global radiology community to work together on these issues.}

The article examines five hypotheses: (1) respondents who are pro-punishment would not be supportive of the courts; (2) respondents who are supportive of the police and the correctional system would be supportive of the courts; (3) respondents who are supportive of the police would not be supportive of the courts; (4) respondents who identify themselves as conservative would not be supportive of the courts; and (5) respondents who express fear and/or concern about crime, and/or who have experienced victimization would not be supportive of the courts. It is found that members of the public express diffuse support for the courts, but criticism center around court leniency and plea bargaining. At least partial support is found for all five hypotheses with support for strong punitive sanctions the best predictor of attitudes toward the courts.}

Spills of fentanyl where it is abused or prepared for illegal distribution can result in persistent contamination of areas. Remediation can be attempted through physical removal but may benefit greatly from application of decontamination solutions that provide in-situ degradation of fentanyl. This work investigates the efficacy of decontamination technologies for degradation of fentanyl-HCl on indoor surfaces. Decontamination studies were conducted to evaluate the oxidative degradation of fentanyl based on percarbonate, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and chlorine (bleach) chemistries. This study utilized an experimental design relevant to field operations to provide direct information to first or hazardous materials responders and providers of environmental fentanyl remediation services, who may otherwise rely on unverified approaches. Across a range of nonporous indoor surfaces, results suggest that water (with or without detergent) spraying alone can physically remove 70–90% of fentanyl (with all fentanyl recovered in runoff). In nearly all cases, the spray application of peracetic acid or acetified bleach oxidants resulted in statistically significant degradation of fentanyl (>95% reduction), with noticeably lower efficacy for other oxidants (e.g., pH neutral bleach and OxiClean™). The decontamination efficacy was significantly reduced upon the addition of cutting agents that competed for oxidant demand.}

Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive survey was used for collecting data from a random sample of 200 Minnesotans during Fall 2002. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used as nonparametric tests for assessing differences in distributions between our categories of study subjects.
Results
Out of 177 deliverable surveys, 81 (46%) were returned. Of these, 80 surveys were usable for analysis. The results showed that the distinguishing characteristics of individuals who sought additional information based on an advertisement were associated with demographic variables such as number of drugs taken daily and monthly out-of-pocket expenditures for prescription drugs. In contrast, distinguishing characteristics of individuals who requested prescription drugs (in addition to seeking information) based on an advertisement were psychographic in nature such as (1) viewing themselves as having greater influence on their physician, (2) having a stronger relationship with their physician, (3) expressing greater satisfaction with their current therapy, (4) viewing prescriptions as less of a burden, and (5) having higher outcome expectations for prescription drugs compared to the respondents who did not ask for a prescription drug based on a direct-to-consumer advertisement.
Conclusions
Distinguishing characteristics of information seekers were demographic in nature, whereas those characteristics of prescription requesters were psychographic in nature.}

abstract = {Introduction
The United States has experienced substantial increases in opioid use for more than two decades. This growth has impacted rural areas where overdoses have risen drastically during this time period and more often involve prescription opioids than in urban areas. Medications for opioid use disorders (MOUDs) are highly underutilized in rural settings due to lack of access, inadequate prescribing, and stigma.
Methods
The study collected data using a cross-sectional online survey of nonprescribing clinicians (NPCs) involved in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States. The study used multiple recruitment methods to obtain a purposive sample of NPCs from a variety of geographical contexts across the nation. The survey assessed demographic and practice characteristics including rurality of practice location, exposure and training related to MOUDs, treatment orientation, treatment preferences for opioid use disorder (OUD), and attitudes toward MOUDs. The study compared treatment preferences for OUD and attitudes toward MOUDs based on rurality of practice location. We tested a mediation model to determine whether the relationship between rurality of practice setting and attitudes toward MOUDs is mediated by treatment orientation.
Results
Most of the 636 NPCs surveyed favored a combination of MOUDs and psychosocial treatment. Compared to clinicians practicing in suburban or urban areas, self-identified rural clinicians were more likely to favor MOUDs alone as most effective and less likely to endorse a combination of MOUDs and psychosocial treatment. Although most NPCs were supportive of MOUDs overall, many endorsed misconceptions related to MOUDs. Rural clinicians were less likely to perceive MOUDs as effective or acceptable compared to those in urban settings. Results of a mediation analysis indicated that practicing in a rural location compared to in an urban location directly and indirectly influenced attitudes toward MOUDs through an effect on treatment orientation.
Conclusions
NPCs play important roles in the implementation of MOUDs, and while efforts to increase their knowledge of and exposure to MOUDs have contributed broadly to more favorable attitudes toward MOUDs among NPCs, this study's findings indicate that additional efforts are still needed, particularly among NPCs who work in rural settings. Findings also indicate that, among rural clinicians, increasing knowledge of and exposure to harm reduction principles may be a necessary prerequisite to engaging them in the implementation of specific harm reduction strategies such as MOUDs.}

abstract = {Objective
Radiologists and other clinicians are facing an increasing number of illegal drug-related medical conditions. We aimed to draw attention to this growing global problem and to highlight some of the important points related to diagnosis and follow-up of body packing. We compare the diagnostic performance of unenhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) and abdomen X-ray for the detection of drug-filled packets.
Materials and methods
Sixty-seven suspects, who underwent both CT and X-ray examinations, have been included in the study. All MDCT and X-ray images were independently and retrospectively reviewed by two observers with different degrees of experience in abdomen imaging. Fifty-two of them were identified as body packers finally. Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were calculated.
Results
Two types of packets with different characteristics were identified in all body packers. Type 1 packets (solid-state drug) were found in 41 patients and type 2 packets (liquid cocaine) in 11 patients. All statistical analyses concern the detection of any packets. That is, the whole evaluation has been performed per patient. Sensitivity/specificity values of type 1 and type 2 packets for MDCT were 100–98%/100–100% and 100–100%/100–100%, respectively. Besides, sensitivity/specificity values of type 1 and type 2 packets for X-ray were 93–90%/100–91% and 64–45%/73–71%, respectively. In addition, interobserver agreements for detection of any packets were excellent (κ=0.96) and good (κ=0.75) for interpretation of MDCT and X-ray, respectively.
Conclusion
Unenhanced MDCT is a fast, accurate and easily used diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity for the exact diagnosis of body packing.}

In this paper I define negative externalities broadly to include effects on members within the same group or organization ‘outvoted’ in a collective decision-making process by a ‘majority’. The Coase theorem states that negative externality problems can be resolved efficiently by contracts, whatever the assignment of property rights, provided there are no transaction costs. Transaction costs are notably neglected in the social choice literature. Thus one might ask whether the Coase theorem might not also hold for the more general case of Arrow's general impossibility theorem, which includes all decisions by political bodies, organizations, groups and individuals and is not limited to decisions related to market participants. If this were so, there would be no need to be concerned about Arrow's general impossibility theorem, since all inefficient outcomes would be removed by contracts. The same would be true for Sen's ‘impossibility of a Paretian liberal’. Also, if such contracts could be enforced, outcomes would be stable, thus removing the instability and inconsistency implied by social preference cycles in which each outcome is dominated by another one. In the present paper I ask whether and under which conditions the Coase theorem can be applied to this general case. In doing so, I shed new light on implicit assumptions of the theorem.}

Three anionic surfactant formulations and one control formulation were each applied to split-thickness human cadaver skin in vitro for 24 h. Electrical conductivity of the skin, determined using a four-terminal resistance method, and water permeation across the skin, determined using a radiolabeled water tracer, were simultaneously measured at several points over the experimental period. Surfactant permeation across the skin was similarly measured using a radiolabeled sodium dodecyl sulfate tracer. Anionic surfactants rapidly enhanced skin electrical conductivity and water permeability in the excised human skin, resulting in nonlinear enhancements in surfactant permeation across the skin over time. Surfactant penetration into the skin was found to increase linearly with increasing surfactant monomer concentration. Surfactant zeta potential was found to correlate well with skin conductivity, water permeation across the skin, and surfactant permeation across the skin, particularly with long surfactant exposures. Micelle charge is a significant predictor of anionic surfactant–induced damage to the human skin, with more highly charged surfactants inducing the most damage.}

The current generating capacity is 12,990 MWe with a share of 40.7 % of the total production of electricity. This active nuclear program causes an inevitable increase in the build-up of radioactive waste, including spent fuel. Therefore, reliable and effective management of radioactive waste and spent fuel has become a key to the continuous growth of the nuclear power program. As of the end of 2000, a total of 57,270 drums of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) were generated from the nuclear powers plants (NPPs). And the total amount of LILW from NPPs, RI applications from more than 1,700 users, and decommissioning will increase to 256,520 drums by 2020. Also, the cumulative amount of spent fuel reached 4,758 MTU by the end of 2000 and will jump to 18,615 MTU by 2020. According to the new national planning, AFR storage facilities for spent fuels will be built by 2016 and a repository for LILW radioactive disposal will be in operation by 2008. Even though Korea has a “wait and see policy” for spent fuel management, several alternative studies on spent fuel management such as DUPIC have been carried out. In a parallel, R&D activities to develop the needed technologies for the permanent disposal of spent fuel and HLW have been implemented. In addition, active R&D on the treatment of radioactive waste from the various nuclear fuel cycles as well as the decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities are in progress. Many of these studies are being pursued in the form of regional as well as international cooperation.}

The fast phase has a time constant on the order of a few minutes, whereas the slow phase occurs over many hours. A physical model for this behavior involving a combination of tranverse diffusion through the tissue and lateral diffusion and exchange with skin appendages is presented. This concept is probed using excised human stratum corneum exposed to aqueous solutions of radiolabeled sodium chloride, tetraethyl ammonium bromide and mannitol, plus previously published data on six other compounds of varying molecular size and polarity. The fast phase desorption process becomes unimportant for lipophilic compounds. Slow phase desorption rates are size-selective, with larger species desorbing much more slowly than smaller ones. Interpreting the size-selectivity in terms of smooth cylindrical pores using the centerline approximation leads to an optimum pore radius of about 8–12Å, depending on the model chosen.}

This study estimated prevalences and correlates of stimulant diversion in the United States and examined relationships between diversion and measures of abuse or dependence.
Methods
We conducted descriptive and multivariate analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Key measures were nonmedical use (misuse) of any prescription stimulant, any stimulant other than methamphetamine, and stimulants indicated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Results
Lifetime stimulant misuse included some misuse of longer-acting ADHD drugs. The majority of past-year misuse involved drugs other than methamphetamine, particularly for youth aged 12–17. Past year misuse was more prevalent among persons aged 12–25, compared with older adults, and among Whites, compared with other groups. Prevalences in large metropolitan areas were lower than or similar to those in less populated areas. About 13% of past-year stimulant misusers met the survey criteria for dependence or abuse, as did about 10% of persons aged 12–25 who misused only nonmethamphetamine stimulants.
Conclusions
Most stimulant misuse in the United States (particularly among youth) involved prescription drugs other than methamphetamine. The problem is not limited to metropolitan areas.}

abstract = {The combined effects of age and training on the regulation of exercise performance may be confounded by the additional challenge of thermoregulation. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the pacing strategy of older men who have recently completed 12 weeks of exercise training (acute) to men who have been regularly (>3 times/week) training for at least 6 months (chronic) in a hot, humid environment and to observe disparity, if any, between acute and chronic exercise training on thermoregulation. Eleven chronically trained men (OT) completed a familiarisation trial before returning after 7–10 days to repeat the protocol. Similarly, eight untrained men (OU-PRE) were familiarised and repeated the protocol before completing 12 weeks of exercise training. Post-training, the eight acutely trained men (OU-POST) returned to the laboratory for a third trial. All trials were conducted on a cycle ergometer at the same time of the day in a climate controlled chamber with a mean dry bulb temperature and relative humidity of 32.0°C and 68%, respectively. OT consumed more water than OU-POST and OU-PRE (P<0.01) whilst no differences were observed in the OU with training. Voluntary activation of the knee extensors decreased by 11.3% (P<0.05) in the OU-PRE after the cycling time trial. However, the decrease in voluntary activation observed in the OU-POST and OT after the cycling time trial were not significant. The OT maintained a higher power output compared with the OU-POST and OU-PRE except for the last sprint, whilst no significant differences in power output were observed between the OU-PRE and OU-POST. The rate of rise in core temperature was significantly higher in the OT compared with OU-POST (P<0.001) and OU-PRE (P<0.001). With more experience in training, the OT used an alternative hydration strategy compared with the OU-POST and OU-PRE to mitigate the effects of possible exercise hyperthermia, ultimately attaining a higher, but non-critical core temperature at the end of the cycling time trial. Twelve weeks of exercise training may not manifest in improved exercise performance per se, but could translate to improved performance of activities of daily and independent living.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Reincarceration in prison or jail correlates with non-sustained HIV viral suppression, but HIV treatment outcomes in released prisoners who are reincarcerated have not recently been systematically assessed despite advances in antiretroviral treatment (ART) potency, simplicity, and tolerability.
Methods
In a retrospective cohort of reincarcerated inmates with HIV in Connecticut (2005–12), we used longitudinally linked demographic, pharmacy, and laboratory databases to examine correlates of viral suppression. The primary outcome was viral suppression on reincarceration, defined as viral load lower than 400 RNA copies per mL.
Findings
Of 497 prisoners and jail detainees with HIV, with 934 reincarcerations, individuals were mostly unmarried, uninsured, and black men prescribed a protease-inhibitor-based ART regimen. During the median 329 days (IQR 179–621) between prison release and reincarceration, the proportion of incarceration periods with viral suppression decreased significantly from 52% to 31% (mean HIV-RNA increased by 0·4 log10; p<0·0001), lower than Connecticut's HIV-infected prison population and those prescribed ART nationally. 158 (51%) of 307 individuals with viral suppression on release had viral suppression on reincarceration. Viral suppression on reincarceration was associated with increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·04, 95% CI 1·01–1·07), being prescribed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens (1·63, 1·14–2·34), and having higher levels of medical or psychiatric comorbidity (1·16, 1·03–1·30).
Interpretation
Identification of individuals most at risk for recidivism and loss of viral suppression might mitigate the risk that repeated reincarceration poses to systems of public health and safety.

Local capital is efficient when most trading is local, but only market capital can support trading between strangers that allows extensive division of labor and industrialization. We show that economies with a low cost of accumulating local capital (say, because people live close together) are richer than economies with a high cost of accumulation when long distance trade is difficult, but are slower to transition to impersonal market exchange (industrialize) when long distance trade becomes feasible. The model provides one way to understand why the wealthiest economies in 1600 AD, China, India, and the Islamic Middle East, industrialized more slowly than the West. We report an array of historical evidence documenting the pre-industrial importance of family and kinship networks in China, India, and the Islamic world compared to Europe, and the modernization problems linked to local capital.}

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}

A large number of potential radioprotectors have been investigated but no approved radioprotector is available. Hence, in quest for radioprotector, repurposing of clinical drug is an approach which aims at finding the radioprotective potential of known drugs so that in case of untoward accident the knowledge could be translated to drug usage. In this study, we have investigated the radical scavenging properties of tetracycline pertaining to radioprotection. Our study suggests that tetracycline hydrochloride efficiently scavenges free radicals in ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assays. Hydroxyl radical scavenging assay has demonstrated its ability to scavenge gamma radiation induced free radicals by lowering the formation of malondialdehyde. Radiation causes damage to macromolecules and hence the protection offered by tetracycline hydrochloride to DNA and protein shows its radioprotective potential. Plasmid DNA relaxation study with pBR322 has shown that tetracycline hydrochloride confers dose modification factor (DMF) of 2 and 4 at 100 μM and 250 μM concentration respectively. Tetracycline hydrochloride has also protected bovine serum albumin (BSA) from radiation induced degradation. The ex vivo studies for lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial membrane potential further substantiate our findings. The whole body animal survival study has shown the drug to offer 20% protection at a lethal radiation dose of 9 Gy. This study demonstrates the radioprotective potential of the drug by providing some insight into ex vivo and in vivo efficacy.}

In Sudan, such horizontal expansion comes at the expense of land devoted to trees and other vegetation, thereby inducing conditions that are inimical to sustainable agricultural production. Different factors have contributed to extensification. Although high economic returns from crop (mainly sorghum) production was an important factor encouraging extensification of rainfed mechanized farming, other factors outside agriculture have also contributed to that expansion. This paper uses data from eastern Sudan and an acreage response model, to identify the most important factors influencing acreage expansion. Different measures and forms of risk were used in the acreage response model. The paper shows how policies in the energy sector can indirectly influence acreage expansion in the agricultural sector.}

abstract = {Background
Methadone maintenance is an effective treatment for opioid dependence but is rarely initiated in US jails. Patient navigation is a promising approach to improve continuity of care but has not been tested in bridging the gap between jail- and community-based drug treatment programs.
Methods
This is an open-label randomized clinical trial among 300 adult opioid dependent newly-arrested detainees that will compare three treatment conditions: methadone maintenance without routine counseling (termed Interim Methadone; IM) initiated in jail v. IM and patient navigation v. enhanced treatment-as-usual. The two primary outcomes will be: (1) the rate of entry into treatment for opioid use disorder within 30days from release and (2) frequency of opioid positive urine tests over the 12-month follow-up period. An economic analysis will examine the costs, cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit ratio of the study interventions.
Results
We describe the background and rationale for the study, its aims, hypotheses, and study design.
Conclusions
Given the large number of opioid dependent detainees in the US and elsewhere, initiating IM at the time of incarceration could be a significant public health and clinical approach to reducing relapse, recidivism, HIV-risk behavior, and criminal behavior. An economic analysis will be conducted to assist policy makers in determining the utility of adopting this approach. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02334215.}

This study explores a focal question about how these new characteristics may affect the education and research related to CPS in 2030, the date identified by the United Nations to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development. To this end, first, we have conducted a trend spotting activity, seeking to identify possible influencing factors that may have a great impact on the future of CPS education and research. These factors were clustered in a total of 12 trends – four certainties; namely connectivity, electrification, data and automation – and eight uncertainties; namely intelligence, data ethics, labour market, lifelong learning, higher education, trust in technology, technological development speed, and sustainable development goals. After that, two of the eight uncertainties are identified and used to construct a scenario matrix, which includes four scenarios. These two uncertainties – the so-called strategic uncertainties – are: fulfilment of sustainable development goals and the nature of the technological development, respectively. These two important uncertainties are considered to build the scenarios due to their potential impact on the research and education of CPS. For instance, sustainable development goals are significant targets for many initiatives, organisations and countries. While 2030 is the deadline to achieve these goals, the relationship between the sustainable development goals related to CPS research and education is not studied well. Similarly, the speed of technological development is seen as a driving force behind future CPS. However, the effect of this speed to CPS research and education environment is not known. Different outcomes of the chosen two uncertainties are, then, combined with the remaining trends and uncertainties. Consequently, four scenarios are derived. The Terminator scenario illustrates a dystopian future where profit is the driving force behind technological progress and sustainable development goals are not accomplished. In contrast, The Iron Giant scenario represents the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals where technological development is the force behind the accomplishment of these goals. The scenario called Slow Progress represents a future where gradual technological improvements are present, but sustainability is still not seen as concerning the issue. The Humanist scenario illustrates a future where slow technological development is happening yet sustainable development goals are successfully implemented. Finally, the scenarios are used to initiate discussions by illustrating what the future of research and education could look like and a list of strategies for future CPS research and education environments is proposed. To this end, we invite educators, researchers, institutions and governments to develop the necessary strategies to enable data-orientated, continuous, interdisciplinary, collaborative, ethical, and sustainable research and education by improving digital fluency, advancing digital equality, contributing to new ways of teaching complex thinking, expanding access to learning platforms and preparing next generations to adapt for a rapidly changing future of work conditions.}

The altitude and position subsystems are based on qLPV model while the rotational subsystem is linear. A linear observer applied to the rotational subsystem is considered to detect actuator faults, which can occur as failures (loss of a propeller or a motor) or partial faults (degradation). Furthermore, fault isolation is done by measuring roll velocity due to the actuator fault. In all cases, sufficient conditions for the existence of the observer and the controllers are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, simulations (on the nonlinear model) are done in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.}

abstract = {The enhancement and restoration of the water quality of deteriorating surface water resources can be challenging, particularly for rivers with multiple usages, such as agriculture, animal husbandry, human residence, and industries. Recently, the performance of DNA-based microbial source tracking (MST) indicators detected by end-point and quantitative PCR assays for identifying sources of fecal pollution from human sewage, swine, and cattle and non-host-specific (universal) fecal pollution in the Tha Chin River basin, Thailand, was evaluated. The present study monitored these validated MST markers and various physicochemical and microbial water quality parameters in samples collected from twelve stations along the Tha Chin River during four sampling events in the wet and dry seasons. No significant difference in precipitation was observed between the wet and dry samplings. Universal markers (both PCR and qPCR) were detected in all 48 samples, indicating persistent and continuing fecal contamination. The sewage- and swine-specific qPCR marker concentrations did not vary among the sampling events, whereas cattle-specific qPCR markers were detected only in the wet season. Animal-specific markers were detected in the lower Tha Chin River section, which is characterized by intensive animal farming. Sewage-specific markers were also found in the lower section and near an upstream residential area. The high agreement (87.5–100%) between the PCR and qPCR results suggested that PCR could serve as a lower-cost MST screening test that requires less technical expertise. A multivariate analysis conducted using the survival analysis procedure to include censored data also emphasized the high pollution in the lower section of the river at all sampling events. Universal and swine-specific markers showed moderate correlations with microbial indicators, including total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci. None of the MST markers or microbial parameters were associated with the measured physicochemical parameters. This study provides the first evaluation of MST markers for monitoring surface freshwater in Thailand, and the findings might aid the pollution surveillance of impaired water bodies and the development of strategies for improving their water quality.}

abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is unarguably the biggest catastrophe of the 21st century, probably the most significant global crisis after the second world war. The rapid spreading capability of the virus has compelled the world population to maintain strict preventive measures. The outrage of the virus has rampaged through the healthcare sector tremendously. This pandemic created a huge demand for necessary healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for advanced robotics and artificial intelligence-based applications. The intelligent robot systems have great potential to render service in diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring, telehealthcare, disinfection, and several other operations during this pandemic which has helped reduce the workload of the frontline workers remarkably. The long-awaited vaccine discovery of this deadly virus has also been greatly accelerated with AI-empowered tools. In addition to that, many robotics and Robotics Process Automation platforms have substantially facilitated the distribution of the vaccine in many arrangements pertaining to it. These forefront technologies have also aided in giving comfort to the people dealing with less addressed mental health complicacies. This paper investigates the use of robotics and artificial intelligence-based technologies and their applications in healthcare to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method is conducted to accumulate such literature, and an extensive review on 147 selected records is performed.}

While the first-best policy is to allow free trade in all goods and services and to use internal taxes and regulation to control the externalities associated with waste disposal, such a policy increases the incentives for firms to evade taxes and regulations and dispose of their wastes illegally. In this case, the optimal tax can be lower than it would be in the absence of illegal activity, and trade restrictions on waste disposal can be welfare improving.}

The method is directed toward the detection of near-surface defects and delaminations located in the vicinity of GFRP–concrete interface. Normal and oblique incidence measurement schemes were adopted and studied for their effectiveness in detecting near-surface anomalies. This technique is also applied to the detection of rebars in reinforced concrete cylinders. Laboratory measurements in the frequency range 8–12GHz were made on artificially damaged GFRP–concrete cylinders for validating the concept of this technique. Spatial resolutions (range and cross-range) are improved by integrating radar measurements at different azimuth angles and in different frequencies, and implementing the developed progressive image focusing scheme. The feasibility of the proposed FAR NDT technique for distant inspection is validated through these studies.}

Risk area determination and cause analysis through risk assessment are essential for disaster risk reduction. Previous studies in Republic of Korea has assessed risk according to administrative district due to limitations in analysis of spatially extensive disaster impact and constructing geospatial data. This study developed and applied a model to assess gridded risk integrating various climate-related disasters in Daegu, Ulsan, Gyeongbook, and Gangwon of Republic of Korea. The developing process consists of design, implementation, and verification stage. The method of assessing risk using proxy variables was applied to the model. Gridded hazards constructed through numerical analysis, exposure, and vulnerability in high-resolution were utilized as input data. The model was verified by analyzing whether the observed damage was located within the upper and lower outliers of the gridded risk. The observed damage in 43 out of 54 (80%) administrative districts was located within the outlier range of gridded risk. Climate-related disaster risk was highest in the central region of Gangwon, which was highly affected by flood and snow risk. In Daegu and Ulsan, the flood risk was high in the low-lying area near the Nakdong and Taehwa rivers due to the concentration of population, building, and infrastructure. The model will be useful for central government, which requires integrated disaster risk information. Gridded risk can be used to determine hot spots in high-resolution for establishing strategies for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation of local government.}

This paper provides four case histories of risk management and post-marketing surveillance programs utilized recently to address problems associated with possible abuse, dependence and diversion. The pharmaceutical sponsors of each of these drugs were invited to present their programs and followed a similar template for their summaries that are included in this article. The drugs and presenting companies were OxyContin®, an analgesic marketed by Purdue Pharma L.P., Daytrana® and Vyvanse®, ADHD medications marketed by Shire Pharmaceuticals, Xyrem® for narcolepsy marketed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and Subutex® and Suboxone® for opioid dependence marketed by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc. These case histories and subsequent discussions provide invaluable real-world examples and illustrate both the promise of risk management programs in providing a path to market and/or for keeping on the market drugs with serious potential risks. They also illustrate the limitations of such programs in actually controlling unintended consequences, as well as the challenge of finding the right balance of reducing risks without posing undue barriers to patient access. These experiences are highly relevant as the FDA increasingly requires pharmaceutical sponsors to develop and implement the more formalized and enforceable versions of the risk management term Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).}

Reliable and accurate detection of cortisol at the skin surface remains a limiting factor in real-time monitoring of cortisol. To address this limitation, cortisol extraction through excised human skin by reverse iontophoresis was studied in vitro in side-by-side diffusion cells using a radiolabeled probe. The skin was subjected to four direct current regimens (0, 28, 56, 113μAcm−2) with the anode in the donor chamber and the cumulative cortisol concentrations recorded in the receiver chamber. The 56 and 113μAcm−2 regimens significantly increased transport of 3H-cortisol through the skin, and current density correlated directly with transcutaneous transport of 3H-cortisol. The threshold of detection of electroosmotic versus passive diffusion of cortisol through the skin was between 28 and 56μAcm−2. The results of this study are significant in examining how lipophilic analytes found in the bloodstream respond to reverse iontophoresis across the skin. In addition, a device integration technique is presented which illustrates how continuous cortisol extraction and sensing could potentially be achieved in a conventional wearable format.}

Twenty cases of moderate and severe frostbite of the hands were analysed to establish trends in surgical treatment. Excision of large blisters and early mobilization in flamazine bags were found to be beneficial. In those patients whose initial skin changes did not extend to the base of the fingers only minor amputations were necessary. The small amounts of necrotic tissue did not interfere with hand movement and operation was therefore delayed until six or seven weeks, so that maximal digital length could be preserved. In contrast, those patients whose initial skin changes involved the whole length of the fingers or extended on to the hands, more proximal amputations were necessary and these amputations were performed at three to four weeks in order to remove the larger amounts of necrotic tissue and facilitate early mobilisation.}

abstract = {Fixed and rotary wing pilots alike are familiar with potential instabilities or with annoying limit cycle oscillations that arise from the effort of controlling aircraft with high response actuation systems. Understanding, predicting and suppressing these inadvertent and sustained aircraft oscillations, known as aircraft (rotorcraft)-pilot couplings (A/RPCs) is a challenging problem for the designers. The goal of the present paper is to give an overview on the state-of-the-art in RPC problem, underlining the future challenges in this field. It is shown that, exactly as in the case of fixed wing APCs, RPCs existed from the beginning of rotorcraft development and that the problem of eliminating them is not yet solved: the current rotorcraft modelling for RPC analysis is rather limited to the particular case analysed and there is a lack of quantitative pilot behavioural models to analyse RPCs. The paper underlines the importance of involuntary pilot control actions, generally attributed to biodynamic couplings in predicting RPCs in rotorcraft. It is also shown that recent experiences demonstrate that modern rotorcraft seem to embed tendencies predisposing the flight control system FCS system towards dangerous RPCs. As the level of automation is likely to increase in future designs, extending to smaller aircraft and to different kinds of operation, the consequences of the pilot ‘fighting’ the FCS system and inducing A/RPCs needs to be eradicated. In Europe, the ARISTOTEL project (2010–2013) has been launched with the aim of understanding and predicting modern aircraft's susceptibility to A/RPC. The present paper gives an overview of future challenges to be solved for RPC-free design and some new solutions herein.}
