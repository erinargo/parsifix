abstract = {In this study, a new visual inspection method that can interactively detect and quantify structural defects using an Extended Reality (XR) device (headset) is proposed. The XR device, which is at the core of this method, supports an interactive environment using a holographic overlay of graphical information on the spatial environment and physical objects being inspected. By leveraging this capability, a novel XR-supported inspection pipeline, called eXtended Reality-based Inspection and Visualization (XRIV), is developed. Key tasks supported by this method include detecting visual damage from sensory data acquired by the XR device, estimating its size, and visualizing (overlaying) information on the spatial environment. The crucial step of real-time interactive segmentation—detection and pixel-wise damage boundary refinement—is achieved using a feature Back-propagating Refinement Scheme (f-BRS) algorithm. Then, a ray-casting algorithm is applied to back-project the 2D image pixel coordinates of the damage region to their 3D world coordinates for damage area quantification in real-world (physical) units. Finally, the area information is overlaid and anchored to the scene containing damage for visualization and documentation. The performance of XRIV is experimentally demonstrated by measuring surface structural damage of an in-service concrete bridge with less than 10% errors for two different test cases, and image processing latency of 2–3 s (or 0.5 s per seed point) from f-BRS. The proposed XRIV pipeline underscores the advantages of real-time interaction between expert users and the XR device through immersive visualization so that a human–machine collaborative workflow can be established to obtain better inspection outcomes in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

abstract = {Online virtual learning resources have been available for learning and teaching in forensic science for some years now, but the recent global COVID-19 related periods of irregular lockdown have necessitated the rapid development of these for teaching, learning and CPD activities. However, these resources do need to be carefully constructed and grounded in pedagogic theory to be effective. This article details eXtended Reality (XR) learning and teaching environments to facilitate effective online teaching and learning for forensic geoscientists. The first two case studies discussed in this article make use of Thinglink software to produce virtual learning and teaching XR resources through an internet system, which was delivered to undergraduate students in 2021. Case one details a range of XR virtual laboratory-based equipment resources, providing a consistent, reliable and asynchronous learning and teaching experience, whilst the second case study presents an XR virtual learning applied geophysics resource developed for a 12-week CPD training programme. This programme involves recorded equipment video resources, accompanying datasets and worksheets for users to work through. Both case studies were positively received by learners, but there were issues encountered by learners with poor internet connections or computer skills, or who do not engage well with online learning. A third case study showcases an XR educational forensic geoscience eGame that was developed to take the user through a cold case search investigation, from desktop study through to field reconnaissance and multi-staged site investigations. Pedagogic research was undertaken with user questionnaires and interviews, providing evidence that the eGame was an effective learning and teaching tool. eGame users highly rated the eGame and reported that they raised awareness and understanding of the use of geophysics equipment and best practice of forensic geoscience search phased investigations. These types of XR virtual learning digital resources, whilst costly to produce in terms of development time and staff resource, provide a complementary virtual learning experience to in-situ practical sessions, and allow learners to asynchronously familiarise themselves with equipment, environments and techniques resulting in more efficient use of in situ time. The XR resources also allow learners to reinforce learning post in-situ sessions. Finally, XR resources can provide a more inclusive and authentic experience for learners who cannot attend or complete work synchronously.}

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a strategic solution to address the increasing demand for cellular connectivity in rural, remote, and disaster-hit regions lacking traditional infrastructure. However, UAVs’ limited onboard energy storage necessitates optimized, energy-efficient communication strategies and intelligent energy expenditure to maximize productivity. This work proposes a novel joint optimization model to coordinate charging operations across multiple UAVs functioning as aerial base stations. The model optimizes charging station assignments and trajectories to maximize UAV flight time and minimize overall energy expenditure. By leveraging both static ground base stations and mobile supercharging stations for opportunistic charging while considering battery chemistry constraints, the mixed integer linear programming approach reduces energy usage by 9.1% versus conventional greedy heuristics. The key results provide insights into separating charging strategies based on UAV mobility patterns, fully utilizing all available infrastructure through balanced distribution, and strategically leveraging existing base stations before deploying dedicated charging assets. Compared to myopic localized decisions, the globally optimized solution extends battery life and enhances productivity. Overall, this work marks a significant advance in UAV energy management by consolidating multiple improvements within a unified coordination framework focused on joint charging optimization across UAV fleets. The model lays a critical foundation for energy-efficient aerial network deployments to serve the connectivity needs of the future.}

abstract = {During ship emergencies, a reliable and efficient evacuation system is able to guide passengers to the appropriate muster stations as quickly as possible. The majority of the existing indoor evacuation systems provide emergency guidance for people trapped in general buildings. However, those systems fail to consider the unique challenges of ship passenger evacuation, such as the effect of ship motion on pedestrian motion and the feedback of pedestrian motion on ship inclination state. Consequently, evacuation guidance provided by these schemes may not always be optimal or may even make the evacuation worse due to the differences in the critical factors influencing emergency guiding between land-based buildings and passenger ships. This paper presents a systematic literature overview of recent advances in building evacuation, followed by a description of the challenges unique to evacuating passengers on vessels. Furthermore, the existing ship evacuation research is reviewed from three aspects, i.e., passenger behavior study, ship evacuation optimization, and evaluation of evacuation on passenger ships. A discussion of land-based evacuation schemes and prospects for ship evacuation is also presented.}

This study explores a focal question about how these new characteristics may affect the education and research related to CPS in 2030, the date identified by the United Nations to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development. To this end, first, we have conducted a trend spotting activity, seeking to identify possible influencing factors that may have a great impact on the future of CPS education and research. These factors were clustered in a total of 12 trends – four certainties; namely connectivity, electrification, data and automation – and eight uncertainties; namely intelligence, data ethics, labour market, lifelong learning, higher education, trust in technology, technological development speed, and sustainable development goals. After that, two of the eight uncertainties are identified and used to construct a scenario matrix, which includes four scenarios. These two uncertainties – the so-called strategic uncertainties – are: fulfilment of sustainable development goals and the nature of the technological development, respectively. These two important uncertainties are considered to build the scenarios due to their potential impact on the research and education of CPS. For instance, sustainable development goals are significant targets for many initiatives, organisations and countries. While 2030 is the deadline to achieve these goals, the relationship between the sustainable development goals related to CPS research and education is not studied well. Similarly, the speed of technological development is seen as a driving force behind future CPS. However, the effect of this speed to CPS research and education environment is not known. Different outcomes of the chosen two uncertainties are, then, combined with the remaining trends and uncertainties. Consequently, four scenarios are derived. The Terminator scenario illustrates a dystopian future where profit is the driving force behind technological progress and sustainable development goals are not accomplished. In contrast, The Iron Giant scenario represents the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals where technological development is the force behind the accomplishment of these goals. The scenario called Slow Progress represents a future where gradual technological improvements are present, but sustainability is still not seen as concerning the issue. The Humanist scenario illustrates a future where slow technological development is happening yet sustainable development goals are successfully implemented. Finally, the scenarios are used to initiate discussions by illustrating what the future of research and education could look like and a list of strategies for future CPS research and education environments is proposed. To this end, we invite educators, researchers, institutions and governments to develop the necessary strategies to enable data-orientated, continuous, interdisciplinary, collaborative, ethical, and sustainable research and education by improving digital fluency, advancing digital equality, contributing to new ways of teaching complex thinking, expanding access to learning platforms and preparing next generations to adapt for a rapidly changing future of work conditions.}

Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.}

At present, mobile users are getting familiar with the latest 5G networks, and the discussion for the next generation of Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks has already been initiated. It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks. This work provides a basis for privacy aspects that will significantly impact peoples’ daily lives when using these future networks.}

We provide two different formulations. In the first formulation, our objective is to maximize the stable throughput of the secondary user subject to Age of Information constraints imposed on the data transmission of the users. While, in the second formulation, we introduce a multi-objective programming approach that investigates the trade-off between the secondary user stable throughput and its Age of Information. Our numerical results characterize the effect of imposing different Age of Information restrictions on the stable throughput region of the network; we show that the stability region, in certain cases, is reduced by only 11% with strict Age of Information restrictions. Our results also investigate the trade-off between the secondary user throughput and the Age of information. Finally, our results show the potential accuracy of the algorithm adopted in this paper to solve the formulated non-linear optimization problems.}

abstract = {6G networks envisioned being the game changer in next generation wireless communication systems that will address the challenges of limited information speed escalated with the augmentation of billions of data applications encountered by the current fifth generation (5G) networks. Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes. This paper pointed out the current intriguing challenges, canvassed the mitigation techniques, and plausible future research opportunities that may privilege the pursuit of this vision.}

This study aimed to gain a holistic view of the applications of ImTs for OSH training and education. A review of the application of ImTs for OSH training and education is conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach and bibliometric analysis. This resulted in the evaluation of 67 relevant journal articles collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The review revealed that ImTs have been applied for OSH training and education in various industries including transportation, construction, mining, and healthcare. It was also revealed that the OSH hazards addressed by ImT-based training and education include but are not limited to fire, fall, electrical and chemical hazards in order to prevent or reduce injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition, it was revealed that one of the benefits of ImTs for OSH training and education is better retention of concepts when compared to conventional training and education. Challenges associated with the use of ImTs for OSH training and education include insufficient display brightness for users to effectively see virtual objects in a brightly luminated environment. Among the recommendations for future work is research into how to develop effective communication methods between trainers and trainees immersed in a virtual environment for trainers to fully understand the difficulties trainees experience in operating the developed ImT-based platform and provide solutions to such difficulties.}

abstract = {Authentic learning is an instructional approach that best occurs when the learning activities are set in real-world contexts. The authenticity of the learning experience increases when learning is situated in a context akin to the real world, and realistic learning experiences are created by carefully designing the learning tasks, context, and environment. The fidelity of a learning task's psychological, physical, functional, and social aspects and environment is the design attributes that contribute to the authenticity of the learning experience. The social context, or the social environment during learning, is essential in engaging learners in authentic learning tasks. In this mixed-method study, we investigate whether the collaborative nature of the learning activities, the authentic design of the learning experience and tasks, and the social environment impact the learner's perceptions of their learning experience and confidence in learning transfer. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and then together through triangulation. The findings of this study suggest that learners perceived the tasks and environment as realistic and the learning activities' collaborative aspect as helpful. The authentic learning environment did not significantly impact learners' confidence to transfer. However, the experience led to valuable metacognitive reflection and change in self-efficacy beliefs about their learning and practice needs. This experience may result in better self-regulation in long-term learning. This paper presents the findings of this study and discusses future research implications.}

This demands the appraisal of the wireless networks with enhanced properties as next-generation communication systems. Although 5G networks show great potential to support numerous IoE based services, it is not adequate to meet the complete requirements of the new smart applications. Therefore, there is an increased demand for envisioning the 6G wireless communication systems to overcome the major limitations in the existing 5G networks. Moreover, incorporating artificial intelligence in 6G will provide solutions for very complex problems relevant to network optimization. Furthermore, to add further value to the future 6G networks, researchers are investigating new technologies, such as THz and quantum communications. The requirements of future 6G wireless communications demand to support massive data-driven applications and the increasing number of users. Unlike existing works, this paper highlights the recent activities and trends toward 6G technology, network requirement, essential enabling technologies for 6G networks, and a detailed use case analysis between 5G and 6G networks. Moreover, this paper surveys emerging 6G connectivity solutions, such as holographic beamforming, artificial intelligence-enabled IoT networks, edge computing, and backscatter communications to serve smart communities. Furthermore, several future research directions to accomplish 6G-based IoT networks are also highlighted.}

In this view, smart city may be viewed as a – one of its kind – laboratory to query the complex human-computer relationship from a multi-dimensional perspective. By adopting this perspective, this paper queries the existing smart city surveillance systems to identify their key limitations and sources of frequently justified controversies. It is argued that to bypass these – first – the value of mesh-technology should be explored. It is also argued that – second – it is necessary not only to bring citizens back in the discussion on smart city, but also to highlight the mechanisms by means of which they might be involved in the co-design of smart city solutions and in urban decision-making. To bridge these two imperatives, smart city is conceptualized as a smart service system and, consequently, a wireless integrated mesh-technology enhanced (WIMTE) smart city surveillance system is elaborated.}

Although still conceptual, Metaverse converges the physical and digital universe, allowing users to seamlessly traverse between them. Digital immersion offers opportunities for people to travel in time, supporting users to experience virtually ancient encounters, space explorations or dangerous natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions. Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse. Although still experimental, Metaverse is expected to revolutionize travel and tourism management and marketing. It empowers destination awareness, positioning and branding, as well as coordination and management, through digital twins. Metaverse provides opportunities to support trip planning, interaction and engagement, effectively transforming consumer behaviour. Visiting and engaging with destinations virtually is expected to motivate real travel, rather than replace it. This paper provides a vision of how Metaverse can revolutionize tourism experiences and transform tourism management and marketing. Drawing on a systematic review of scholarly works, articles from media and industry reports, this study defines and conceptualizes the Metaverse ecosystem for tourism and travel. It explores the foundations of the disruptions that Metaverse brings to tourism destinations and organisations and identifies the building blocks of Metaverse tourism. The study outlines research directions so that the tourism industry can take full advantage of the Metaverse capabilities and opportunities emerging as well as identify challenges for the future.}

abstract = {One of Industry 4.0’s greatest challenges for companies is the digitization of their processes and the integration of new related technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), which can be used for training purposes, design, or assistance during industrial operations. Moreover, recent results and industrial proofs of concept show that these technologies demonstrate critical advantages in the industry. Nevertheless, the authoring and editing process of virtual and augmented content remains time-consuming, especially in complex industrial scenarios. While the use of interactive virtual environments through virtual and augmented reality presents new possibilities for many domains, a wider adoption of VR/AR is possible only if the authoring process is simplified, allowing for more rapid development and configuration without the need for advanced IT skills. To meet this goal, this study presents a new framework: INTERVALES. First, framework architecture is proposed, along with its different modules; this study then shows that the framework can be updated by not only IT workers, but also other job experts. The UML data model is presented to format and simplify the authoring processes for both VR and AR. This model takes into account virtual and augmented environments, the possible interactions, and ease operations orchestration. Finally, this paper presents the implementation of an industrial use case composed of collaborative robotic (cobotic) and manual assembly workstations in VR and AR based on INTERVALES data.}

Thus, traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) approaches cannot keep up with rapidly evolving application requirements. This challenge has motivated the adoption of the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept to adapt the automation into network services management. By automating network and service management, ZSM offers efficiency to control network resources and enhance network performance visibility. The ultimate target of the ZSM concept is to enable an autonomous network system capable of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization based on service-level policies and rules without human intervention. Thus, the paper focuses on conducting a comprehensive survey of E2E ZSM architecture and solutions for 5G and beyond networks. The article begins by presenting the fundamental ZSM architecture and its essential components and interfaces. Then, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for key technical areas, i.e., ZSM automation, cross-domain E2E service lifecycle management, and security aspects, are presented. Furthermore, the paper contains a summary of recent standardization efforts and research projects towards the ZSM realization in 5G and beyond networks. Finally, several lessons learned from the literature and open research problems related to ZSM realization are also discussed in this paper.}

Building Sustainability Assessment (BSA) methods are a key tool to evaluate building sustainability, but their use is hindered by the time-consuming assessment process and required data. With the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM), new potentialities have been found, such as continuous data storage and integrated building design. Facing the opportunity to integrate BSA into BIM, this research aims to automate the assessment of a BSA scheme by creating a BIM-based application for the project's early stages. Visual Programming Language (VPL) was used to translate SBToolPT-H criteria requirements into computable rules and create the SBToolBIM application. Results show the feasibility of automating BSA with BIM, by integrating 19 criteria into SBToolBIM and identifying BIM connections for the remaining 6 criteria. The applied procedure has established a novel framework to carry out BSA within the BIM environment in a faster and more reliable way using fewer resources. It offers a decision support tool for the design process able to provide valuable contributions to enhance building sustainability and meet decarbonisation and climate goals.}

In this paper we explore the effects of Twitter, other forms of online media, and television news broadcasts on the accumulation of signatures in e-petitioning. We analyze the case of “Bring Back Our Girls,” a Change.org petition initiated in spring 2014 following the abduction of 276 young female students from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State, Nigeria by heavily armed members of the Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group. The petition targeted government leaders around the world. We found evidence that tweets and certain forms of online media, together with cable news items, are related to the likelihood of individuals to sign an e-petition. The results provide evidence in support of a hybrid media system in which diverse forms of media behave with diverse logics and impacts in their effects on e-petitions.}

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

abstract = {Emergency evacuation is viewed as a common strategy adopted during the disaster preparedness stage of evacuation to ensure the safety of potentially affected populations. In emergency evacuation studies, soft computing approaches and methodologies have been widely used to support effective decision-making, providing robust and low-cost solutions. To understand the current status and trends of research on soft computing applications for emergency evacuation studies, 778 related studies published in the core database of Web of Science from 2000 to 2020 were considered in this study. A scientometric analysis and a comprehensive review were performed using a scientific mapping of the knowledge domain. This paper presents a set of analyses with the following primary objectives: (1) to explore and visualize the bibliometric characteristics and contents of the academic field concerned with the soft computing approaches for emergency evacuation; and (2) to review and analyze the knowledge, hotspots, and future outlooks related to soft computing approaches for emergency evacuation. The results provide some important insights regarding the existing soft computing methods that have been used in the emergency evacuation field over the past 20 years. Based on the conducted review, this paper proposes that future studies should concentrate on exploring the potential of innovative soft computing approaches for crowd modelling and enabling more accurate evacuation simulation and optimization.}

abstract = {South Korea became the first country in the world to launch a nationwide 5G network and commercialize 5G services. The Korean government played an essential role in the development of 5G, creating a tailored institutional arrangement that allowed South Korea to be at the forefront of 5G. In particular, the government set up a detailed time plan on how to go about 5G deployment and commercialization. The government also facilitated collaborative work between companies, research institutes, and academia, and strongly promoted R&D work for the development of 5G equipment, devices, and applications, providing financial and administrative support, opportunities for field trials, and various forms of incentive, including tax benefits to companies. This study analyzed the 5G socio-technical system in South Korea through the lens of technology systems theory, identifying and discussing crucial factors that have propelled 5G development and major latent aspects, such as the lack of killer applications for consumers and in vertical industries, which may potentially hinder the further growth and stabilization of the 5G system in South Korea.}

abstract = {Recent technological breakthroughs and significant expansion in the number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, a new paradigm of unparalleled user experiences, dramatically improved a host of innovative applications, and the emergence of various use cases has begun. To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}
