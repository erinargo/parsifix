abstract = {The evolution of industries have introduced versatile technologies, motivating limitless possibilities of tackling pivotal global predicaments in the arenas of medicine, environment, defence, and national security. In this direction, ardently emerges the new era of Industry 5.0 through the eyes of biomanufacturing, which integrates the most advanced systems 21st century has to offer by means of integrating artificial systems to mimic and nativize the natural milieu to substitute the deficits of nature, thence leading to a new meta world. Albeit, it questions the natural order of the living world, which necessitates certain paramount stipulations to be addressed for a successful expansion of biomanufacturing Industry 5.0. Can humans live in synergism with artificial beings? How can humans establish dominance of hierarchy with artificial counterparts? This perspective provides a bird's eye view on the plausible direction of a new meta world inquisitively. For this purpose, we propose the influence of internet of things (IoT) via new generation interfacial systems, such as, human-machine interface (HMI) and brain-computer interface (BCI) in the domain of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, which can be extended to target modern warfare and smart healthcare.}

abstract = {The rapid advance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in recent times and the current pandemic caused by COVID-19 have profoundly transformed society and the economy in most of the world. The education sector has benefited from this ICT-driven revolution, which has provided and expanded multiple new tools and teaching methods that did not exist just a few decades ago. In light of this technological change, virtual laboratories (VLs) based on the use of virtual reality (VR) have emerged, which are increasingly used to facilitate the teaching–learning process in a wide range of training activities, both academic and professional types. The set of advantages offered by this type of VL, the main of which are listed in this article, has made its use increasingly common as support for engineering classes at universities. This paper presents a study involving 420 engineering students from Spanish and Portuguese universities and associated analyses on the assessment of different parameters in various VLs designed by the authors. The results obtained indicate that, in general, VR-based VLs are widely accepted and demanded by students, who likewise consider real laboratories (RLs) necessary in face-to-face teaching. In the current post-COVID-19 educational scenario, VLs and RLs will coexist within the new hybrid models that combine face-to-face and online teaching and learning.}

We contribute to establishing a cumulative body of knowledge by conducting such an SLR. We synthesize 221 articles published on 11 Industry 4.0 technologies between 2005 and 2021. Rather than aggregate implications, our SLR presents the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of each core technology vis-à-vis supply chain performance individually. We integrate our findings into a framework of Industry 4.0 supply chain performance and derive promising avenues for future research. Specifically, we call for more research on (a) the challenges and critical success factors of Industry 4.0 technologies; (b) hitherto underexplored core technologies of the Industry 4.0; (c) the interaction of multiple core technologies (are they complements or substitutes?); as well as for (d) further consolidation and interdisciplinary dissemination efforts.}

Guided by constructivist paradigm, seven focus group interviews over two time periods with 52 travellers were conducted that revealed differences in meanings, competencies and structures associated with process and discretionary technologies at airports. By focusing on practices rather than understanding individual behaviour the research reveals meanings associated with technology practices by young adults at airports, an alignment by young adults with process technologies and gaps with discretionary technologies at airports. Practically, this research provides airport management with a useful lens to increase satisfaction and revenues by re-imagining discretionary technologies in similar ways to process technologies at airport departure terminals.}

This study fills that need by presenting evidence-based research on such preferences and perceptions from the perspective of need theories, taking Taiwan as a case study. Specifically, we investigated Taiwanese citizens’ preferences for 35 SC services of seven dimensions classified in two domains, as well as their three perceptions of the usefulness of these SC services in the realization of human needs. The results show that most of our respondents clearly perceived SC services as both important and useful to their existence, relatedness, and growth needs, and that they expressed relatively higher preferences for such services to operate in the “hard” domain – e.g., smart energy, smart transport, or smart safety –than the “soft” one, e.g., smart living. Based on these findings, this study provides policy recommendations that, if implemented, could be expected to advance SC development by increasing citizens’ usage of SC services in both the hard and soft domains, and serve the wider aim of improving their well-being and quality of life.}

The dexterity measures involved in controlling input modalities could pose challenges to users with motor disabilities—including the inability to move their limbs, particularly their upper and lower arms, and fingers, due to traumatic damage or congenital problems. In order to meet these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual reality (VR)-based medium to help users with motor disabilities build simple 3D models for architectural design. The concept of operating buttons using head-gaze in the VR environment has been utilised to perform scaling—a 3D object manipulation method—to create simplified building models. Moreover, navigation in the VR space using tilting of the head has been employed with the user seated on a revolving chair, thus eliminating the need for any limbic movement. Unity game engine was used to develop two variations of the VR model with a different button layout for creating simple cuboidal volumes mimicking buildings in the virtual environment. Both variations have been tested with 32 individuals against a specific performance indicator (i.e., task completion time) and self-reported metrics, such as the perception of effort applied and degree of visual clutter, followed by retrospective participant feedback sessions. One of the VR application's variants (i.e., variant 1) produced promising results regarding overall usability and effort demand. This paper also proposes a methodological framework for an AI-based, intelligent, and adaptive VR application interface that caters to the user's abilities and pain points in real-time. In the future, this framework could be instrumental in creating a comprehensive gaze-based VR tool for 3D modelling having multiple functions to help users with motor disabilities.}

abstract = {The deployment of pervasive information and communication technologies (ICTs) within smart city initiatives transforms cities into extraordinary apparatuses of data capture. ICTs such as smart cameras, sound sensors and lighting technology are trying to infer and affect persons’ interests, preferences, emotional states, and behaviour. It should be no surprise then that contemporary legal and policy debates on privacy in smart cities are dominated by a debate focused on data and, therefore, on data protection law. In other words, data protection law is the go-to legal framework to regulate data processing activities within smart cities and similar initiatives. While this may seem obvious, a number of important hurdles might prevent data protection law to be (successfully) applied to such initiatives. In this contribution, we examine one such hurdle: whether the data processed in the context of smart cities actually qualifies as personal data, thus falling within the scope of data protection law. This question is explored not only through a theoretical discussion but also by taking an illustrative example of a smart city-type initiative – the Stratumseind 2.0 project and its living lab in the Netherlands (the Stratumseind Living Lab; SLL). Our analysis shows that the requirement of ‘identifiability’ might be difficult to satisfy in the SLL and similar initiatives. This is so for two main reasons. First, a large amount of the data at stake do not qualify as personal data, at least at first blush. Most of it relates to the environment, such as, data about the weather, air quality, sound and crowding levels, rather than to identified or even likely identifiable individuals. This is connected to the second reason, according to which, the aim of many smart city initiatives (including the SLL) is not to identify and target specific individuals but to manage or nudge them as a multiplicity – a combination of the environment, persons and all of their interactions. This is done by trying to affect the ‘atmosphere’ on the street. We thus argue that a novel type of profiling operations is at stake; rather than relying on individual or group profiling, the SLL and similar initiatives rely upon what we have called ‘atmospheric profiling’. We conclude that it remains highly uncertain, whether smart city initiatives like the SLL actually process personal data. Yet, they still pose risks for a wide variety of rights and freedoms, which data protection law is meant to protect, and a need for regulation remains.}

In a digitalized context, a cloud manufacturing platform for occupational health assessment, capable of collecting physiological, environmental and manufacturing process data can potentially enable prompt action to prevent fatalities. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based framework and associated methods to classify physiological data acquired using wearable sensors during manufacturing work, to be utilized in a fuzzy-based expert system to determine the level and type of health risk for Operator 4.0.

A focus on early hemorrhage control with aggressive use of tourniquets and hemostatic gauze is now generally accepted. This narrative literature review aims to discuss external hemorrhage control and the applicability of military concepts in space exploration. In space, environmental hazards, spacesuit removal, and limited crew training could cause significant time delays in providing initial trauma care. Cardiovascular and hematological adaptations to the microgravity environment are likely to reduce the ability to compensate, and resources for advanced resuscitation are limited. Any unscheduled emergency evacuation requires a patient to don a spacesuit, involves exposure to high G-forces upon re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, and costs a significant amount of time until a definitive care facility is reached. As a result, early hemorrhage control in space is critical. Safe implementation of hemostatic dressings and tourniquets seems feasible, but adequate training will be essential, and tourniquets are preferably converted to other methods of hemostasis in case of a prolonged medical evacuation. Other emerging approaches such as early tranexamic acid administration and more advanced techniques have shown promising results as well. For future exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, when evacuation is not possible, we look into what training or assistance tools would be helpful in managing the bleed at the point of injury.}

abstract = {Objectives
To analyse the 2020 international and European recommendations for Paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), highlighting the most important changes and propose lines of development in Spain.
Methods
Critical analysis of the paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation recommendations of the European Resuscitation Council.
Results
The most relevant changes in the CPR recommendations for 2020 are in basic CPR the possibility of activating the emergency system after performing the five rescue ventilations with the mobile phone on loudspeaker, and in advanced CPR, bag ventilation between two rescuers if possible, the administration of epinephrine as soon as a vascular access is obtained, the increase in the respiratory rate in intubated children between 10 and 25 bpm according to their age and the importance of controlling the quality and coordination of CPR. In CPR training, the importance of training non-technical skills such as teamwork, leadership and communication and frequent training to reinforce and maintain competencies is highlighted.
Conclusions
It is essential that training in Paediatric CPR in Spain follows the same recommendations and is carried out with a common methodology, adapted to the characteristics of health care and the needs of the students. The Spanish Paediatric and Neonatal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Group should coordinate this process, but the active participation of all paediatricians and health professionals who care for children is also essential.
Resumen
Objetivos
Analizar las recomendaciones internacionales y europeas de reanimación cardiopulmonar (RCP) pediátrica del 2020, resaltar los cambios más importantes y plantear líneas de desarrollo en España.
Métodos
Análisis crítico de las recomendaciones de reanimación cardiopulmonar pediátrica del European Resuscitation Council.
Resultados
Los cambios más relevantes en las recomendaciones de RCP del año 2020 son: en la RCP básica la posibilidad de activar el sistema de emergencias tras realizar las cinco ventilaciones de rescate con el teléfono móvil en altavoz, y en la RCP avanzada la ventilación con bolsa entre dos reanimadores si es posible, la administración de adrenalina en cuanto se canaliza un acceso vascular, el aumento de la frecuencia respiratoria en los niños intubados entre 10 y 25 rpm de acuerdo a su edad y la importancia de controlar la calidad y coordinación de la RCP. En la formación en RCP se destaca la importancia de la formación de las habilidades no técnicas como el trabajo en equipo, liderazgo y la comunicación y el entrenamiento frecuente para reforzar y mantener las competencias.
Conclusiones
Es esencial que la formación en RCP Pediátrica en España siga las mismas recomendaciones y se realice con una metodología común, adaptada a las características de la atención sanitaria y las necesidades de los alumnos. El Grupo Español de Reanimación Cardiopulmonar Pediátrica y Neonatal debe coordinar este proceso, pero es esencial la participación activa de todos los pediatras y profesionales sanitarios que atienden a los niños.}

This study presents a review about human-human interactions (i.e., interactions among people or groups of people and their influence on behavior during emergencies), human-building interactions (i.e., how buildings influence human behavior and how human behavior impacts the building performance during emergencies), human-emergency interactions (i.e., how emergency situations impact human behavior and people’s coping strategies with emergencies), and second-order interactions among humans, buildings, and emergencies. The review reveals that while various human-human interactions among building occupants have been investigated, some of them (e.g., grouping behavior, information sharing) are less understood, and the interactions between building occupants and staff members need further explorations. With regard to human-building interactions, prior studies have been limited to certain types of buildings and building attributes, while the aggregate impact of a combination of building attributes should be more studied. Moreover, building fires were the most frequently examined emergency type, while other types of emergencies, such as earthquakes and acts of extreme violence, received less attention. Additionally, second-order interactions among humans, buildings and emergencies have not been widely studied. This paper also puts forward recommendations for future research, including validating prior findings when transforming them into real-world applications, leveraging the strength of different data collection and interpretation methods, as well as collaborating more closely with researchers and practitioners in related areas.}

While adopted for their convenience outside of the healthcare sector, these invasive, semi-permanent implantable devices create augmented bodies that can be subject to ubiquitous surveillance. Situating human microchip implantations within surveillance literature, we draw from neoliberal perspectives of surveillance to examine augmented bodies, particularly as sources for market activity and as subjects of social control and sorting when these bodies are used as access control mechanisms, payment methods, and tracking means in employment, residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. History has demonstrated time and time again how unfettered technology applications and uses have led to real and/or perceived misuse by private and public sectors. Through the lens of function creep, we identify a pattern of expansion of applications and uses of technology beyond those originally intended across new technologies, such as DNA genetic genealogy databases, IoT wearables, and COVID-19 contact tracing apps, and provide illustrative examples of function creep, particularly the use of these technologies in criminal investigations and prosecutions despite not being intended or marketed for such use. By demonstrating the lack of clearly defined boundaries in the applications and uses of various new technologies and their associated data, and the ways they were misused, we demonstrate how human microchip implantations are headed on a similar path. The current and potential future uses of this technology raise concerns about the absence of regulation, law, and policy barring or limiting its application and use in specific sectors, and the impact of this technology on users’ security, data protection, and privacy. Undeniably, the present and potential future functions, applications, uses, and extensions of human microchip implantations in various sectors warrant a proactive examination of their security, privacy, and data protection consequences and the implementation of proactive policies to regulate new and currently unregulated uses of this technology and its associated data within these sectors.}

abstract = {During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (also known as COVID-19), workforce downsizing needs, safety requirements, supply chain breaks and inventory shortages affected manufacturing systems’ and supply chain’s responsiveness and resilience. Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.}

As the adoption of wearable devices spreads, there are cultural and social impacts that represent both barriers and opportunities, with subsequent policy ramifications. All too often designers, technologists, and policymakers operate independently developing products that are out of sync, lack interoperability, or are hindered by well meaning, but obstructive policy. This paper proposes a futures-based, iterative policy-informed design framework for developing wearable devices that guides interdisciplinary collaborators early in the process of designing a research & development plan. This approach allows for the development of “images of the future” through which various potential implications and effects of device design in social, technological, and regulatory contexts can be explored.}

abstract = {Objectives
The main objective of the study is to determine the efficiency in the execution of the START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) triage, comparing Virtual Reality (VR) to Clinical Simulation (CS) in a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI). The secondary objective is to determine the stress produced in the health professionals in the two situations described.
Materials
A comparative study on the efficiency and the stress during triage in a MSI was conducted. The basal and post levels of salivary α-amylase (sAA) activity were measured in all the participants before and after the simulation.
Results
The percentage of victims that were triaged correctly was 87.65% (SD = 8.3); 88.3% (SD = 9.65) for the Clinical Simulation with Actors (CSA) group and 87.2% (SD = 7.2) for the Virtual Reality Simulation (VRG) group, without any significant differences (p = 0.612) between both groups. The basal sAA was 103.26 (SD = 79.13) U/L with a significant increase (p < 0.001) with respect to the post-simulation levels (182.22, SD = 148.65 U/L). The increase of sAA was 80.70 (SD = 109.67) U/mL, being greater for the CSA group than the VRG group.
Conclusion
The results show that virtual reality method is as efficient as clinical simulation for training on the execution of basic triage (START model). Also, based on the sAA results, we can attest that clinical simulation creates a more stressful training experience for the student, so that is should not be substituted by the use of virtual reality, although the latter could be used as a complementary activity.}

abstract = {Background
Using a mobile virtual reality (VR) platform to heighten realism for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training has the potential to improve bystander response.
Objectives
We examined whether using a VR mobile application (mApp) for CPR training would improve bystander response compared with a standard mApp CPR training.
Methods
We randomized lay bystanders to either our intervention arm (VR mApp) or our control arm (mApp). During a post-intervention skills test, we collected bystander response data (call 911, perform CPR, ask for an automated external defibrillator (AED)), along with CPR quality (chest compression (CC) rate and depth). Wilcox rank sum was used to analyze CC rate and CC depth as they were not normally distributed; Pearson’s Chi-square was used to analyze Chain of Survival variables.
Results
Between 3/2018 and 9/2018, 105 subjects were enrolled: 52 VR mApp and 53 mApp. Mean age was 46 ± 16 years, 34% were female, 59% were Black, and 17% were currently CPR trained (≤2 years). Bystander response was significantly higher in the VR mApp arm: called 911 (82% vs 58%, p = 0.007) and asked for an AED (57% vs 28%, p = 0.003). However there was no difference in CPR performed (98% vs 98%, p = NS) and the application of the AED (90% vs 93%, p = NS). When comparing the VR mApp to the mApp, mean CC rate was 104 ± 42 cpm vs 112 ± 30 cpm (p = NS), and mean CC depth was 38 ± 15 mm vs 44 ± 13 mm (p = 0.05).
Conclusion
The use of the VR mApp significantly increased the likelihood of calling 911 and asking for an AED, however, CC depth was decreased.}

s This work emphasizes the current research status of the urban Digital Twins to establish an intelligent spatiotemporal framework. A Geospatial Artificial Intelligent (GeoAI) system is developed based on the Geographic Information System and Artificial Intelligence. It integrates multi-video technology and Virtual City in urban Digital Twins.
Methods
Besides, an improved small object detection model is proposed: YOLOv5-Pyramid, and Siamese network video tracking models, namely MPSiam and FSSiamese, are established. Finally, an experimental platform is built to verify the georeferencing correction scheme of video images.
Result
The Multiply-Accumulate value of MPSiam is 0.5B, and that of ResNet50-Siam is 4.5B. Besides, the model is compressed by 4.8 times. The inference speed has increased by 3.3 times, reaching 83 Frames Per Second. 3% of the Average Expectation Overlap is lost. Therefore, the urban Digital Twins-oriented GeoAI framework established here has excellent performance for video georeferencing and target detection problems.}

abstract = {Background
Worldwide, bystander CPR rates are low; one effective way to increase these rates is to train schoolchildren; however, the most effective way to train them is currently unknown.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, evaluated whether CPR training for schoolchildren, using innovative teaching modalities (nonpractical, self, or peer-training) versus standard instructor-led training, resulted in higher quality CPR, self-confidence and short-term (≤3 months post-training) or long-term (>3 months post-training) retention of CPR skills.
Results
From 9793 citations, 96 studies published between 1975 and 2022 (44 RCTs and 52 before/after studies) were included. There were 43,754 students, average age of 11.5 ± 0.9 (range 5.9–17.6) and 49.2% male. Only 13 RCTs compared practical vs. nonpractical training (n = 5), self- vs. instructor-led training (n = 7) or peer- vs. instructor-led training (n = 5). The observed statistically significant differences in mean depth and rate of compressions between children with hands-on practical training and those without were not clinically relevant. Regardless of training modality, compression depth was consistently suboptimal. No differences were observed in CPR skills immediately or ≤ 3 months post-training, between children who were self- or peer-trained vs. instructor-led. Due to lack of data, we were unable to evaluate the impact of these novel training modalities on student self-confidence.
Conclusion
Although innovative training modalities are equally effective to instructor-led training when teaching schoolchildren CPR, compression depth was frequently suboptimal. Recommendations on standardized training and evaluation methods are necessary to understand the best ways to train children.}

Moreover, the discussion of leveraging machine learning algorithms optimized for resource-constrained environments is presented. Finally, important open challenges and potential research directions in the field of edge computing and edge AI have been identified and investigated. We hope that this article will serve as a common goal for a future blueprint that will unite important stakeholders and facilitates to accelerate development in the field of Edge AI.}

Promoting and implementing 5G smart healthcare can reduce inconsistencies in allocating medical resources and expedite medical advancements. This article studied the 5G and its need in healthcare. Smart Principal Features and Serviceable Pillars of 5G Technology for healthcare are discussed briefly. Finally, identify and discuss significant applications of 5G for healthcare. 5G promises to give people more control over their health. With the implementation of 5G, we will most certainly witness the introduction of new medical technology, allowing patients to test and monitor their health from the comfort of their homes. The combination of 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will result in a network of smart devices that connect and, as a result, will broaden the backdrop for decision-making. It also creates new potential for the growth of the internal medical ecosystem. 5G network connection and coverage may be limited in areas with tall and broad trees and buildings. In the future, network operators and medical device makers will collaborate more in smart medical care.}

However, previous studies about VBL have not mainly focused on forensic purposes. In this study, we revisit the traditional VBL framework by replacing its elements with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, and discuss what points of a VBL framework are important for investigation support tools. Based on this revisit, we claim that there are two essential points for investigation support tools. One is maintainability that results from the ease of replacing the implemented algorithms with more appropriate algorithms. The other is the interpretability of bottlenecks in the current system. These two advantages are specific and essential to forensic science where practicality is important.}

These results show the ethical themes that were operative in such discussions: privacy, safety, enforceability, crime, nuisance and professionality. Underlying most of these themes is trust. We discuss this concept with respect to the good society, and we suggest that trust may be more critical to emerging technologies than technologies in general. That is, trust in an emerging technology is required for it to be accepted and more fully integrated in society. Without trust, it is difficult for society to accept the technology.}

Each government strives to build a modern, intelligent medical system that provides maximum population coverage with high-quality medical services. The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) significantly improves the accessibility and effectiveness of the healthcare system by forming the eHealth environment, thus, providing an opportunity to enhance the quality of patient care and significantly speed up the work of medical experts and reduce costs for medical services. Shifting medical services to digital and remote operations requires a lot of computational capabilities. Implementing new computing paradigms is prominent — remote services face new requirements due to the increasing data and demand for new computing solutions. Computing paradigms, e.g., Cloud, Edge, Mobile Edge Computing, besides others, are used to process the collected medical data, improving patient healthcare quality. This paper focuses on computing solutions for medical use cases by offering a comprehensive survey on standardization aspects, use cases, applicable computing paradigms, security limitations, and design considerations within the ICT usages for medical applications. Finally, it outlines the most critical integration challenges and solutions from the literature.}

It comprises a definition of forensic science and seven fundamental principles that emphasise the pivotal role of the trace as a vestige, or remnant, of an investigated activity. The Sydney Declaration also discusses critical features framing the forensic scientist’s work, such as context, time asymmetry, the continuum of uncertainties, broad scientific knowledge, ethics, critical thinking, and logical reasoning.

abstract = {In gentrifying communities, youth of color are often the subject of citizen-based policing by white residents, who use nonemergency 311 calls to police unwanted behaviors, eliminate incumbent symbols of ownership (e.g., graffiti), and gain control of the space. To date, little research has examined such policing efforts in neighborhoods experiencing environmental gentrification. In these neighborhoods, parks and greenways are often established to attract white newcomers, and thus citizen-based policing to ensure that parks remain “white spaces” might be particularly strong. Using a mixed-method design, we examined the citizen-based policing of youth proximate to Chicago’s 606, an urban greenway connected to environmental gentrification. Interviews revealed that white residents frequently and increasingly used citizen-based policing to monitor and control youth of color’s behaviors on The 606. In response, youth avoided greenway segments in white-majority neighborhoods, used the greenway when less populated, or avoided it altogether. A mixed-effects quasi-Poisson model supported these findings, showing that the number of graffiti-related 311 calls significantly increased in the years preceding and following the greenway’s opening, particularly in areas closest to The 606. Planners and policymakers need to recognize these issues and work to ensure park spaces in gentrifying areas promote inclusion and diversity.}

abstract = {Objective
We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance.
Background
Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity.
Method
Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone.
Results
In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate.
Conclusion
Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance.
Application
The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance.
Précis
High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

Thus, using Actor-Network Theory (ANT) associated with a single case study, the relevant actors in the formation of a socio-technical network resulting in the popular demonstrations that occurred in Brazil were identified. The study reveals that these demonstrations were comprised of different actors aligned around a single obligatory passage point, namely the social media. It was established that social media played an important role in this popular demonstration, prompting a change in the way citizens interact and unite, making formal organizations less necessary, and broadening the political participation of society. Nevertheless, the misalignment between the global and local network of actors led this uprising to fade out over time. Lastly, implications for practice and theory accrued from the investigation of this social media-enabled movement are set forth.}

abstract = {Water infiltration through soil is deemed the most serious problem and the main cause of concrete degradation in subway facilities. A huge amount of water intrusion may accelerate the deterioration mechanisms, such as rebar corrosion, spalling, and water voids. Such mechanisms can compromise the structural integrity and jeopardize public safety. The inspection and assessment of concrete structures are predominantly conducted based on visual inspection technologies. Although, these techniques may be consistent in detecting surface defects, e.g. cracks and spalling, they fall short in identifying subsurface distresses such as air voids, and water voids. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been extensively utilized for probing concrete infrastructure. Nevertheless, the deterioration mapping of air voids and water voids in concrete has seldom been performed. The objective of this paper is to develop an integrated model based on image processing of GPR profiles to automate air/water voids detection and mapping in subway systems. First, an automated localization scheme is developed to create a consistent inspection pattern. Second, subsurface data are collected in a subway facility, and processed using the image-based analysis technique. Third, the locations and dimensions of the detected defects are mapped to evaluate the severity of deterioration. The developed method is implemented on a tunnel in Montreal subway network. Then, validated via field inspection, digital images, coring samples, infrared thermography and 3D laser techniques. The validation outcomes reflect a strong correlation and compatibility with the generated GPR-based maps. The proposed framework is expected to assist infrastructure managers in identifying critical deficiencies and by focusing constrained funding on most deserving assets.}

The authors of these manuscripts were asked to propose future directions and challenges in their respective research areas. This paper summarises these proposals and concludes with general directions and challenges related to computing in civil and building engineering. The suggested directions include enhancing digital information modelling and extending the standardised product and process modelling technologies; improving decision-support capabilities and decision–implication analysis through integrating wider-aspects of the problem space; embedding optimisation techniques more holistically; and integrating all of these by making more use of virtualisation in an attempt to simplify the use of the output technologies. The challenges that will arise as a consequence will inevitably include reducing the inherent complexity in such a manner that the resulting models are both realistic and useable by all of the disciplines involved. Another main challenge is the inclusion of concepts that are significant but less readily formalised than traditional engineering ones. It could be argued that the high-level directions and challenges mentioned above are not very different from those that could have been predicted a considerable number of years ago. However, it is worth stressing that, with increased capabilities and reach of information technologies and greater expectations of decision makers, the current ambitions are an order of magnitude greater. The proposed directions and the resulting challenges are now much greater in both scale and breadth.}

abstract = {Physical evacuation drills are pre-planned activities to train building occupants in facing emergencies and evaluate safety performances. Nowadays, technologies including Virtual Reality (VR) and Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) are shifting from the physical to the virtual paradigm. AR enables just to extend real-world environment, while VR and IVR allow to (re)create and manipulate digital environments. VR and IVR simulation systems have been observed to guarantee higher involvement and long-term information retention — leveraging more attractive experiences and psychological arousal. However, efforts should be provided to improve end-user training while assessing occupants’ behaviors and the effectiveness of the emergency plan. This paper proposes a systematic literature review of VR and IVR evacuation solutions. To support and guide such effort, we formulated thirteen structured research questions investigating scenarios, recipients, requirements, objectives, methods, and technologies. The results mainly show that VR and IVR drills almost entirely tackle a single hazard, considers occupants as sole system recipients, and lack systems formalization. Among the most relevant outcomes, the paper analyzes the need for enhancing the modeling of emergency systems (e.g., signage, alarms), user inclusiveness (i.e., impaired individuals), devices, non-player characters, and additional effects (e.g., heat reproduction, sounds, and smells). These measures can improve the level of realism experienced by the user of IVR simulators and pave the way to more reliable outcomes.}

abstract = {Motion capture (mocap) data stores the skeleton movement of recorded objects or humans and is essential for various 3D applications, such as games, animations, virtual reality, surveillance and medical. The exploration of steganography using mocap data is still limited despite its wide-range of potential practical applications. Compared to image, audio, and video steganography, the challenges in mocap steganography arise from differences between the temporal lengths and topologies of the cover and secret data, non-zero residuals between mocap data sequences, non-repetitive movements in different chunks of the mocap data. Deep neural network (DNN) based hiding models could be a potential solution to address these challenges in mocap steganography. DNN-based steganography has been adopted in many recent works and has shown promising results in steganographic techniques in various domains, including image, audio and video; however, to date, no prior work has investigated the application of DNN models for hiding mocap data. In this paper, we investigate solutions to deal with the challenges in mocap steganography and propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network model, DSteganoM, to hide a sequence of skeletal motions into another. The proposed model is capable of learning and exploring the redundancy of spatial and temporal Euclidean positional information in each skeletal motion for the hiding task. In addition, by introducing upsampling and pooling mechanisms in our network architecture, the DSteganoM model also can hide mocap data of different topologies with different dimensions. Experimental results show that the proposed DSteganoM model outperforms other state-of-the-art models and can visually reconstruct the cover and secret with high resistance to signal perturbation. Our work bridges the research gap in applying deep steganography to address the challenges in mocap data hiding.}

Comparable to an unexpected emergency, HeartRun consists of authentic activities involving different roles, game tasks, locations and physical objects to support process-oriented learning for first responders. It aims to enhance the psychological preparedness of the rescuer and thus promotes a more prompt and appropriate response. In this paper, we describe a cycle of three design-based research (DBR) studies in which HeartRun was explored with school children. In order to better understand how to design mobile game environments that support dimensions of seamless learning, we analysed children and their knowledge-building practices while learning with HeartRun. The mobile game has evolved significantly from its initial conception through an iterative process of (re) designing and testing the synchronization between physical and digital worlds, learner collaboration and ubiquitous knowledge access, i.e. dimensions of mobile seamless learning activities. Based on our experiences, we conclude by discussing challenges and shortcomings of mobile game–based learning environments.}

Such capabilities are typically offered by Edge Data Centers (EDC). The MEC paradigm is not tied to a single radio technology, rather it embraces both cellular and other radio access technologies such as WiFi. Distributed intelligence at the edge for AI purposes requires careful spatial planning of computing and storage resources. The problem of EDC deployment in urban environments is challenging and, to the best of our knowledge, it has been explored only for cellular connectivity so far. In this paper, we study the possibility of deploying EDC without analyzing the expected data traffic load of the cellular network, a kind of information rarely shared by network operators. To this purpose, we propose in this work CLUB, CLUstering-Based strategy tailored on the analysis of urban mobility. We analyze two experimental mobility data sets, and we analyze some mobility features in order to characterize their properties. Finally, we compare the performance of CLUB against state-of-the-art techniques in terms of the outage probability, namely the probability an EDC is not able to serve a request. Our results show that the CLUB strategy is always comparable with respect to our benchmarks, but without using any information related to network traffic.}

These technologies could discover and warn users about unanticipated events such as just-in-time warnings about the hazards, distractions, extreme weather calamities, and potential impending dangers. An automated personalized agent helps monitor, diagnose problems, and protect people in an urban environment. Researchers have proposed various systems and implemented them in multiple domains.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) now forms a more and more important part of human lives. After years focussed on the development of AI, the initial hype about its many expected benefits has gradually given way to rising ethical concerns about its inherent risks and dangers. Efforts to confront and contain the most serious risks related to AI have now prompted a number of legislative or regulatory proposals at the national, regional and global level. One of the most comprehensive regulatory initiatives is the European Union's proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), which was released in April 2021 with a view towards establishing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. To this end, the draft AIA pursues a proportionate horizontal and risk-based regulatory approach to AI, broadly classifying AI into the categories of unacceptable risks, high risks and low or minimal risks. The unacceptable risks are those that are deemed to contravene European Union values, and therefore, they are considered to be ‘prohibited AI practices’ by Article 5 AIA. The prohibited AI practices are classified into four categories, namely 1) AI systems deploying subliminal techniques; 2) AI practices exploiting vulnerabilities; 3) social scoring systems; and 4) ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. The proposed regulatory approach, however, appears problematic given the four categories’ inherent interrelatedness and the numerous possibilities for their mutual combination and entwinement. It is also problematic from the perspective of the human mind, as each of the four categories alone allows for the manipulation of human thought and behaviour, thereby endangering freedom of thought and other fundamental rights. In the context of the proposed AIA, both aspects give rise to unknown and unsolved conundrums that create difficult regulatory challenges that raise the necessity to also look at the wider implications of these technologies for the entire legal system. As these conundrums often find their expression in paradoxes and oxymora, this article calls for a wider interdisciplinary debate and advocates a different regulatory strategy using these concepts to transcend the limitations inherent in dualistic or dichotomous modes of legal thinking.}

The goal of the present paper is to explore the latter aspects considering a case study in the context of energy management in industry, and focusing on a measuring procedure that is part, e.g., of energy audit inspections. To this aim, a VRTS was developed and used to conduct two user studies: a first study designed to investigate the effectiveness of the devised system when used as an alternative or in combination with lecture and laboratory-based teaching experiences, and a second study aimed to compare two different approaches (traditional learning, TL, and learning by teaching, LBT) for exploiting the provided VR-based functionalities in a learning path. Experimental results showed that the use of the VRTS alone improved the participants’ performance compared to traditional experiences, and that LBT proved to be more effective that TL for practical learning purposes.}

The interference between tone counting and mathematical calculations was worse than the interference between tone counting and running and kayaking. For climbing, the difference in interference was more nuanced with evidence indicating climbing uniquely asserts task prioritization.

abstract = {Recent developments in geospatial information technology have prompted researchers to utilise geospatial information for decision making in disaster situations. Cultural properties should be preserved because they reflect the local characteristics and knowledge of their creators. Therefore, damaged cultural properties, which are difficult to restore, should be among the first considerations in a disaster situation. In this paper, we propose a method for using geospatial information to promote cultural heritage resilience with respect to disasters. Images from satellites, drones, and terrestrial sensors are available in various forms and provide various types of information. The acquired data can be formed into a digital cultural heritage cube, which enables timely access to any desired data. Additional information can be derived from the accumulated data through image fusion processes and the ancestors’ knowledge encapsulated in cultural properties. To verify this, we explored two disasters—arson and forest fires—in Korea. We concluded that, if the proposed method is applied to cultural properties, the damage to culture assets can be minimised and their resilience can be enhanced.}

In this paper, we conduct a thorough review of the peer-reviewed and grey literatures on wearable healthcare. Then, using SWOT analysis, we examine the market’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and some of the major threats it faces. Our structured examination revealed that the primary areas of innovation in wearable healthcare include infant safety and care, elderly care, chronic disease management, military support, sports medicine, and preventive medicine. We also found that several hurdles stand in the way of the wearable market’s success; these include threats to data security and privacy, regulatory requirements, cost of system operation and management, and subpar adoption rates. Overall, our analysis revealed that significant effort is needed to address the identified technological, societal, and governmental barriers that are preventing the wearable healthcare market from reaching its full potential. Incentives by the Federal government that fuel innovation and encourage adoption by healthcare professionals and patients is deemed necessary for the wearable market’s continued growth.}

As a result, the size of the empirical crowd dynamics literature has rapidly grown and has more than doubled within only the last two years. This paper comprehensively reviews experimental studies of pedestrian dynamics published between April 2017 and July 2019. The aim is to capture the unprecedented growth of the experimental literature, analyse the ways in which the research landscape is changing and identify the emerging topics. Laboratory crowd experiments were found to be the most popular method among all empirical methods, covering the most diverse range of topics and constituting nearly half of the empirical literature. The use of animal/insect crowd experiments, on the other hand, appears to be on the decline. Virtual-reality and evacuation-drill studies have maintained their popularity. Pedestrian flow at bottlenecks, walking behaviour and route choice persist to be the top conventional topics. However, new research themes have emerged or have notably gained heightened momentum. This includes the evacuation of vulnerable groups (i.e. elderly, children, mobility impaired), vertical evacuation, evacuation under limited visibility, social groups and evacuation training/education. While the top conventional topics are predominantly explored through laboratory crowd experiments, the methods of evacuation drills and virtual/augmented reality are proving more instrumental in studying the top emerging topics. This highlights the complementary relation of various experimental approaches in this field. More work seems to be needed to establish the transferability of experimental findings across methods, geometric layouts, contexts and demographics.}

abstract = {This paper explores a novel design of ergonomic gesture control with visual feedback for the UR3 collaborative robot that aims to allow users with little to no familiarity with robots to complete basic tasks and programming. The principle behind the design mirrors that of a 3D joystick but utilises the Leapmotion device to track the user's hands and prevents any need for a physical joystick or buttons. The Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) ergonomic tool was used to inform the design and ensure the system was safe for long-term use. The developed system was assessed using the RULA tool for an ergonomic score and through an experiment requiring 19 voluntary participants to complete a basic task with both the gesture system and the UR3's RTP (Robot Teach Pendant), then filling out SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaires to compare the usability of both systems. The task involved controlling the robot to pick up a pipe and then insert it into a series of slots of decreasing diameter, allowing for both the speed and accuracy of each system to be compared. The experiment found that even those with no previous robot experience were able to complete the tasks after only a brief description of how the gesture system works. Despite beating the RTP's ergonomic score, the system narrowly lost on average usability scores. However, as a contactless gesture system it has other advantages over the RTP and through this experiment many potential improvements were identified, paving the way for future work into assessing the significance of including the visual feedback and comparing this system against other gesture-based systems.
Relevance to Industry
In industrial environments where the robots may need to be frequently reprogrammed through complex RTPs, companies must call on those with specialist training even to make minor adjustments. The presented system takes advantage of gesture control to allow for easy interaction with industrial robots, even for untrained operators.}

We first examine the metaverse’s technologies and its underlying business models, which hold immense strategic implications for organizations and industries, and might require rethinking the future of work. As with most emerging technologies able to generate, collect, and process user data, the metaverse comes at a price; leveraging the metaverse strategically will require ethical and DEI considerations. After examining all these aspects of the metaverse, we reflect on ways IS scholarship engaged in strategizing can advance theoretical and practical knowledge by generating novel research questions and outlining a research agenda. Our contribution is twofold: first, we analyze the metaverse using a sociotechnical lens, thereby setting the ground for future studies of the phenomenon. Second, we identify specific strategic implications as well as DEI opportunities and challenges associated with the metaverse, and discuss how scholarship versed in IS strategizing can contribute to addressing them, both theoretically and empirically.}

However, it is very challenging to predict crowd emotion using conventional emotion clues of humans from the video surveillance data, e.g. facial expression or body gesture. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a crowd emotion evaluation method using fuzzy inference according to the arousal-valence model of the crowd movement. Specifically, the enthalpy, magnitude variance, confusion index and crowd density are extracted to describe crowd emotion. The enthalpy value and magnitude variance are taken as the input of the fuzzy inference system of arousal. And the confusion index and crowd density are used as the input of the fuzzy system of valence. The arousal value and valence value are the output respectively. Through establishing the relationship between arousal, valence and crowd features, the fuzzy rules are constructed to infer the emotion in the crowd scene. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the arousal and valence in crowd emotion.}

The main objective of this research is to enhance route preemption and optimization of emergency vehicle trips through automated data restoring and harvesting approaches with the existing data. This research restores vehicle paths of emergency vehicles with a pathfinding algorithm and harvests spatial data along with the restored vehicle paths. Dijkstra's algorithm and the proposed data harvesting methods are used to bring the enriched data to analyze the emergency vehicle routes. Based on the enriched data, two applications are developed to identify which factors have significant impacts on emergency response time and which intersections and specific driving routes at these intersections have more impact on emergency response time. This research will contribute to the body of knowledge by expanding interpretation of emergency vehicles and providing further information for the emergency response time.}

The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. Our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners’ thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making.}

Main issues in WSN are represented by the large number of sensor nodes, multi-hop communication approach, and needs for an efficient use of available limited sensor energy. In this work an emergency scenario is considered and a WSN is used as a communication infrastructure. To limit the power consumption, the WSN is activated only when the emergency occurs. Few mobile nodes (the rescuers) are moving in the area. In these critical network scenarios, adaptive routing is essential to ensure reliable communication with first responders. At the same time, localizing both WSN nodes and moving nodes is an essential issue for routing the rescuers towards victims. In this paper, the authors jointly tackle routing and localization problems for reducing the network signaling communication as much as possible, which is the most power-consuming operation in WSNs. In particular, it is proposed a distributed localization algorithm, based on a ranging technique, designed by mapping the localization into a stochastic estimation problem for systems with uncertainties.}

However, since their adoption in the 1920s, the design of safety footwear has experienced few technology advancements. Since becoming commonplace in the 1970s the majority of safety footwear is bought off-the-shelf without much thought given to the exacting user requirements or operational environment. A literature review was conducted, indicating that ongoing developments remain based upon historical concepts. The requirement for radical change is compelling due to the poor comfort, fit, aesthetic appeal offered by current designs, need for frequent replacement and lack of application specific safety footwear. In addition, both safety footwear design and manufacture continues to lag behind other types of footwear production most notably, athletic footwear. This paper introduces a radical new vision for safety-smart footwear, produced on a mass customization basis that is integrated functionally with the operational environment and various safety systems in line with Industry 4.0 philosophies of automation and digitalization. This vision of safety-smart footwear not only has the potential to support operational functions, but can help to mitigate safety risks and raise alarms. Through this, end user and operational data is continually fed back via cloud based data repositories to provide ongoing design iterations both at a customized user level and industry-specific level. By realizing the vision for safety-smart footwear presented in this paper, it is expected that benefits will include improved user comfort and fit, increased aesthetic appeal and enhanced user safety, specific to their industrial environment. This has the potential to have knock on societal impacts that go beyond the industrial environment.}

Video surveillance is a key technology to fight against terrorism and public safety management. In video surveillance, detection of moving objects from a video is important for object detection and behaviour understanding. Detection of moving objects in video streams is important process of revelation and background subtraction is popular approach for foreground segmentation. In this paper high speed background subtraction algorithm for moving object detection is proposed. The video is first converted to streams and then applied to convolution filter which removes high frequency noise components to obtain smoothened images. The smoothened images are then applied to background subtraction algorithm with adaptive threshold which gives detected object present in background image. The detected object is then applied to convolution filter to remove the spurious distorted pixels which improves the quality of image. The proposed architecture was designed using VHDL language and implemented using Spartan-6 (XC6SLX45-2csg324) FPGA kit. It is observed that the proposed technique is better compared to existing method in terms of image quality and speed of operations.}

Ethification shall be understood as a proliferation of moral principles and moral values in the legal discourse within the areas of research, innovation governance, or directly enforceable rules in the industry. Although the ethical considerations may seem distant from mere regulatory compliance, the opposite is true. The article focuses on the positive side of the “ethification” of digital laws through the lens of legal requirements for impact assessments pursuant to General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessments in the proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act. Authors argue that ethical considerations are often absent in the context of using new technologies including artificial intelligence, yet they may provide additional value for organizations and society as a whole. Additionally, carrying out ethics-based assessments is already in line with existing regulatory requirements in the fields of data protection law and proposed EU AI regulation. These arguments are reflected in the context of facial recognition technology, where both data protection impact assessment under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessment under the proposal of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act will be mandatory. Facial recognition technology is analyzed through the ethics-based assessment involving stakeholder analysis, data flows map, and identification of risks and respective countermeasures to show additional insights that ethics provides beyond regulatory requirements.}

abstract = {This paper presents an outline for improved localization and situational awareness in fire emergency situations based on semantic technology and computer vision techniques. The novelty of our methodology lies in the semantic linking of video object recognition results from visual and thermal cameras with Building Information Models (BIM). The current limitations and possibilities of certain building information streams in the context of fire safety or fire incident management are addressed in this paper. Furthermore, our data management tools match higher-level semantic metadata descriptors of BIM and deep-learning based visual object recognition and classification networks. Based on these matches, estimations can be generated of camera, objects and event positions in the BIM model, transforming it from a static source of information into a rich, dynamic data provider. Previous work has already investigated the possibilities to link BIM and low-cost point sensors for fireground understanding, but these approaches did not take into account the benefits of video analysis and recent developments in semantics and feature learning research. Finally, the strengths of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art is its (semi-)automatic workflow, generic and modular setup and multi-modal strategy, which allows to automatically create situational awareness, to improve localization and to facilitate the overall fire understanding.}

abstract = {5G is the fifth generation wireless network, with a set of characteristics, such as high bandwidth and data rates, massive connectivity, broad coverage, and low latency. The scenarios of using 5G include enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC), and ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC). 5G is expected to support a wide variety of applications, such as city management, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, and energy management. In this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping study that covers the literature published between January 2012 and December 2019 regarding using 5G in smart cities. The scenarios, architecture, technologies, challenges, and lessons learned of using 5G in smart cities are summarized and further analyzed based on 32 selected studies, and the results are that: (1) The studies are distributed over 27 publication venues. 17 studies report results based on academic studies and 13 studies use demonstration or toy examples. Only 2 studies report using 5G in smart cities based on industrial studies. 16 studies include assumptions of 5G network design or smart city scenarios. (2) The most discussed smart city scenario is transportation, followed by public safety, healthcare, city tourism, entertainment, and education. (3) 28 studies propose and/or discuss the architecture of 5G-enabled smart cities, containing smart city architecture (treating 5G as a component), 5G network architecture in smart cities, and business architecture of using 5G in smart cities. (4) The most mentioned 5G-related technologies are radio access technologies, network slicing, and edge computing. (5) Challenges are mainly about complex context, challenging requirements, and network development of using 5G in smart cities. (6) Most of the lessons learned identified are benefits regarding 5G itself or the proposed 5G-related methods in smart cities. This work provides a reflection of the past eight years of the state of the art on using 5G in smart cities, which can benefit both researchers and practitioners in this field.}

It is an essential sense and a social one, as it typically implies an interaction with another person. However, even though tactile feedback is used to enhance the user experience in Virtual and Augmented Reality applications (VR/AR), tactile cues are usually rendered reactively by the system. In this paper, we design and assess a touch user interface that is built on a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) to allow peers to exchange tactile signals in VR applications. First, we explored the interface capabilities by assessing different gestures to be adopted in the reproduction of tactile signals. Then, we assessed its use in conjunction with a vibrotactile HMD in a collaborative virtual setup where users could communicate only through vibrotactile cues. Results have shown that accuracy in target localization increases as target density decreases, that swipe gestures are performed with more accuracy when supported by anchor-points, and that accuracy of rhythm reproduction decreases with pace. When applied to a collaborative task, the interface presented high usability and allowed subjects to fully use tactile feedback as a means for intercommunication with their partners.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 requires a strong understanding of Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS). An Industry 4.0-enabled manufacturing environment that offers real-time data gathering, transparency and analysis across all parts of a manufacturing process is known as cyber–physical systems, also known as cyber manufacturing. Data analytics enables executives to make data-driven choices and boost productivity, while automation speeds up manufacturing and decreases machine downtime. The main objective of deploying Industry 4.0 solutions is to enable manufacturing organisations to increase collaboration by making the correct information accessible to the right people in real time. The aim of encouraging optimal decision-making at the appropriate moment is to improve efficiency and production further. The critical terms in Industry 4.0, such as the CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twin, are widely used interchangeably in conversations about smart manufacturing. These are essential to Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing because they give users access to real-time operating data of the equipment they represent. Cyber components and physical components make up the two elements of CPS. The main aim of this paper is to brief CPS and its need for Industry 4.0. Embedded Processes and Smart 5C diagrammatically elaborate architecture of CPS for Industry 4.0. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses significant applications of CPS in Industry 4.0. For this paper, we identified and then studied relevant literature on CPS for establishing an Industry 4.0 environment. CPS is integrated into several items, including vehicles and other equipment, to carry out particular functions. CPS can be utilised in any industry, including engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and even health care, because they are all easy to use. CPS network collaborative systems are built for communication. Furthermore, cutting-edge network technologies like cloud solutions are used by CPS.}

abstract = {Illegal hunting and trade might be reduced by devaluing the commodities of live animals. However, theory and anecdote suggest that the tactic’s success depends on the proportion devalued and may also generate unintuitive and counter-productive outcomes. Unfortunately, the difficulty of researching criminals limits empirical and experimental tests of theory and practice. We overcame those constraints by designing and conducting a competitive game; simulating criminal hunting of protected wildlife where the proportion of animals devalued across a meta-population increases at a cost to investment in security. We conducted 33 games each with 10 different volunteers from the public visiting five public events (fairs, gala, and carnivals) in different communities of the Wellington metropolitan area, New Zealand. Games confirmed the relative effectiveness of security over devaluation tactics. Even moderate security protected the majority of commodities, but only when devaluation reached extraordinary levels (≥90%) was it protective, and even then only partially. When the risk of hunting is low, reduced rewards were enough to still motivate hunting. Games also revealed that when security and devaluation tactics are mixed across a meta-population, elevated risk caused hunters to revise their valuation of devalued commodities upwards and hunt and harvest them anyway. Counter-intuitively, more valuable devalued commodities were preserved but those of lesser value harvested, then sometimes discarded but at other times their value claimed. And lastly, hunters choose to take greater risks, shifting their activities to adjacent populations where the returns could be greater even though known to be better protected. The survival of wildlife in those populations deteriorated, even as the number of hunters caught increased. In all these ways, our games demonstrated how the addition of devaluation tactics to strategies for protecting wildlife can incentivise and exacerbate, rather than mitigate, the illegal hunting and trade of wildlife, consistent with theory and anecdote.}

AI is described both in the abstract and in four forms that are currently evident not only in laboratories but also in real-world applications. Clarity about the public's concerns is sought by articulating the threats that are inherent within AI. It is proposed that AI needs to be re-conceived as `complementary artefact intelligence', and that the robotics notion of `machines that think' needs to give way to the idea of `intellectics', with the focus on `computers that do'. This article lays a foundation for two further articles on how organisations can adopt a responsible approach to AI, and how an appropriate regulatory scheme for AI can be structured.}

All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.}
