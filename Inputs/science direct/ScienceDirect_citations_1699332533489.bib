abstract = {Sensory science has advanced significantly in the past decade and is quickly evolving to become a key tool for predicting food product success in the marketplace. Increasingly, sensory data techniques are moving towards more dynamic aspects of sensory perception, taking account of the various stages of user-product interactions. Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.

abstract = {The growing demand for smart wearables, coupled with the omnipresence of graphene due to its array of outstanding thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, have driven the industry-led initiatives to develop lightweight, smart, and robust graphene-based wearable technologies. The substantial research and the increase in technology readiness levels (TRLs) of graphene-based technologies have led to the adoption of graphene in many industries. Graphene-based wearables are one such technology that involves closer interaction of graphene by the end-user. Despite this, understanding the toxicological risks associated with using graphene-based wearables is still in the fundamental stage. Herein, graphene-based wearables and industrial-scale fabrication techniques for the development of graphene-based wearables are reviewed. The main goal of the review is to initially evaluate the likelihood of user exposure to graphene from the wearable device and the potential health effects. The subsequent health risks based on graphene's physicochemical characteristics are also discussed. A framework to elucidate the risk is presented in terms of crucial exposure routes, possible graphene interactions, recent exposure assessments, detection removal techniques from the human body, and risk management protocols. It is hoped that this review may aid towards establishing a reasonable practice concerning the safe integration of graphene materials into wearables and facilitate their commercialization.}

To date, however, there has been little research done from a users perspective of what constitutes a good or bad city dashboard and to establish essential user-centered design principles. In this foundational study, we examine four city dashboards with respect to their design, content, usability, and utility as experienced by existing dashboard users. The study presented was undertaken using a protocol analysis that elicited verbal reports through concurrent think-aloud sessions. In addition, critical incident technique procedures were followed to collect interaction data of critical significance to the users. A content analysis was then conducted on transcripts from these sessions. The research identified specific areas of concern to current dashboard users and led to the creation of new and informed guidelines for producing a dashboard system for Dublin, Ireland.}

abstract = {Location-Based Games (LBGs) rely on the player’s location to change its game state. Developing worldwide LBGs is a challenging task due to the need to deploy game instances in multiple locations, while maintaining the same game balancing, features, and even correlations between locations of the game and the real world. Hence, it is virtually impossible to manually design interactions, challenges, and game scenarios for every place a player is at. As a result, even modern LBGs still present huge balancing differences between regions and avoid exploring the competition between players like other game genres. This work uses Procedural Content Generation to transpose maps of LBGs while focusing on maintaining their game balancing. We convert LBGs into a game model based on a directed weighted graph using information about Points-of-Interest (POIs) around the players’ location. This game model is simplistic and lightweight, which makes it suitable to wearable and IoT devices that are becoming popular among LBGs. Moreover, we use a Genetic Algorithm to generate a corresponding LBG instance with similar game balancing. To validate the proposed approach, we designed four LBGs with distinct features, gameplay, and mechanics, and conducted an experiment that required samples to compare maps generated by the algorithm in different locations. Results indicate that games with similar game balancing score higher and that the number of POIs has a significant impact on the performance of the approach. Finally, we can conclude that this work contributes to improving the development of LBGs by helping to mitigate the challenge of transposing LBGs while maintaining game balancing.}

With the latest innovations in AI efficiency, the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the rise of edge computing, the potential of edge AI has now been unlocked. This study provides a thorough analysis of AI approaches and capabilities as they pertain to edge computing, or Edge AI. Further, a detailed survey of edge computing and its paradigms including transition to Edge AI is presented to explore the background of each variant proposed for implementing Edge Computing. Furthermore, we discussed the Edge AI approach to deploying AI algorithms and models on edge devices, which are typically resource-constrained devices located at the edge of the network. We also presented the technology used in various modern IoT applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart homes, industrial automation, healthcare, and surveillance. Moreover, the discussion of leveraging machine learning algorithms optimized for resource-constrained environments is presented. Finally, important open challenges and potential research directions in the field of edge computing and edge AI have been identified and investigated. We hope that this article will serve as a common goal for a future blueprint that will unite important stakeholders and facilitates to accelerate development in the field of Edge AI.}

abstract = {Massive developments in mobile wireless telecommunication networks have been made during the last few decades. At present, mobile users are getting familiar with the latest 5G networks, and the discussion for the next generation of Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks has already been initiated. It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks. This work provides a basis for privacy aspects that will significantly impact peoples’ daily lives when using these future networks.}

abstract = {Recent technological breakthroughs and significant expansion in the number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, a new paradigm of unparalleled user experiences, dramatically improved a host of innovative applications, and the emergence of various use cases has begun. To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}
