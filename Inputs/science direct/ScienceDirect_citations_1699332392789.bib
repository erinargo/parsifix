abstract = {Summary
Wireless power transfer (WPT) is pivotal for powering electrical devices when cable connection is inconvenient or risky. Recent advancements in WPT technology stem from innovative physical mechanisms. This review examines these groundbreaking WPT mechanisms, the impact of 2D materials such as MXenes, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers on wearable and implanted bioelectronics. Essential aspects such as power transfer efficiency, material portfolio, 2D materials' significance, transferable power range, and primary influence areas are discussed. The review concludes with future WPT possibilities for wearable and implantable technologies, including novel antennas, transparent devices, bioresorbable implants, electrotherapy, haptic interface, ultrafast 2D diodes, transistors, charge pumps in the 5G/6G range, and wireless brain-machine interfaces.}

abstract = {Even the most junior Warfighters must effectively interact and negotiate with locals from communities that do not share their religious beliefs, social perspectives or customs. These cultural differences introduce a layer of uncertainty into chaotic operational contexts that are marked by moments of intense stress, and often contribute to strong emotional responses such as anxiety or anger. Unchecked, these emotional responses can escalate and lead Warfighters to make judgments and decisions they might not otherwise make. In high stakes situations, even the slightest mistake may have tragic consequences; thus, a need exists to equip Warfighters with skills that allow them to recognize/regulate their emotions. Emotional Intelligence (EI) “is the ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions” [1]. Learning effective strategies to manage our emotions is critical for laying a strong foundation for the development of positive relationships [2], [3]. Being able to effectively build positive relationships in diverse settings is a key attribute of cross cultural competence that may be improved through EI training. By practicing emotion recognition/regulation strategies, individuals will begin to replace ineffective decision-making with productive responses to challenging situations. In order to understand how emotions can influence decision making and social judgment, various moderating factors need to be considered, including cultural, group, and individual differences in emotional recognition/regulation [4]. We provide a brief overview of the operational need, define the basic tenets of EI, and describe how this approach could be implemented within an existing military training setting. We describe how emotion recognition and regulation skills would be exercised and evaluated and list potential benefits of using immersive training for skill development. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future research and development in this area.}

We also identify if these strategies lead to positive or negative responses and/or mitigation of the crisis. Results show that several response strategies included in extant crisis response frameworks can be effective in dealing with AI crises, whereas other strategies tend to be unsuccessful. Our analysis also points to the emergence of a crisis communication strategy that takes advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the accountability of AI to mitigate the crisis.}

abstract = {Since Smart Cyber–Physical Systems (sCPS) are complex and decentralized systems of dynamically cooperating components, architecture-based adaptation is of high importance in their design. In this context, a key challenge is that they typically operate in uncertain environments. Thus, an inherent requirement in sCPS design is the need to deal with the uncertainty of data coming from the environment. Existing approaches often rely on the fact that an adequate model of the environment and/or base probabilities or a prior distribution of data are available. In this paper, we present a specific logic (CB logic), which, based on statistical testing, allows specifying transition guards in architecture-based adaptation without requiring knowledge of the base probabilities or prior knowledge about the data distribution. Applicable in state machines’ transition guards in general, CB logic provides a number of operators over time series that simplify the filtering, resampling, and statistics-backed comparisons of time series, making the application of multiple statistical procedures easy for non-experts. The viability of our approach is illustrated on a running example and a case study demonstrating how CB logic simplifies adaptation triggers. Moreover, a library with a Java and C ++ implementation of CB logic’s key operators is available on GitHub.}

However, in existing literature for human action recognition from a video, there is a lack of synergy in investigating spatial geometry and temporal dynamics in a joint representation and embedding space. In this paper, we propose a dilated Silhouette Convolutional Network (SCN) for action recognition from a monocular video. We model the spatial geometric information of the moving human subject using silhouette boundary curves extracted from each frame of the motion video. The silhouette curves are stacked to form a 3D curve volume along the time axis and resampled to a 3D point cloud as a unified spatio-temporal representation of the video action. With the dilated silhouette convolution, the SCN is able to learn co-occurrence features from low-level geometric shape boundaries and their temporal dynamics jointly, and construct a unified convolutional embedding space, where the spatial and temporal properties are integrated effectively. The geometry-based SCN significantly improves the discrimination of learned features from the shape motions. Experiment results on the JHMDB, HMDB, and UCF101 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed representation and deep learning method.}

Conceptual advances in the study of tourist videography have produced a new model of these practices which is applied here to explain the nature of tourist videography with drones. An international sample of 351 vacation drone videos was subjected to content analysis, and an analysis of their metadata. The results show a significant variation in the content, technological and social practice of production of vacation drone videos depending on the type of video creator and, therefore, empirically validate and expand extant knowledge of drone videography as an emerging visual practice in tourism contexts. The findings establish that analysing the videos from the perspective of videography generates insights that are of value to destination management organizations and tourist businesses. We conclude that destination management organizations should see vacation drone videos as a new type of user-generated content for their destinations, as well as a potential source of innovative marketing ideas, and that they should engage more proactively with vacation drone videographers to maximise the impact of this opportunity.}

At the same time, studies about recessions examine primarily their reasons and consequences. Currently, there is no research examining the role of city technology as a strategic option for firms in a recession environment. To address this gap we develop a conceptual framework from studies of recessions and examine the case study of the IBM Smarter Cities initiative against this framework. Our case builds on interview and archival data. Our study offers two contributions. First, we offer an empirical examination of city technology from the perspective of stakeholders and actors who are tasked with the role to create and disseminate these technologies instead of the perspective of cities that use the technology. Second, we propose a strategic view to city technology and showcase the distinctive theoretical and empirical insights that future studies can develop by shifting the attention on the processes and practices inside the ICT organisations creating and disseminating these city technologies.}

This research study focuses on enhancing the healthcare system using a cognitive-based cloud framework. We employ the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect patient data and utilize a cloud-based cognitive framework for real-time patient monitoring. We aim to achieve cost-effective and high-quality healthcare. Deep learning techniques are applied to assess the health status and obtain experimental results. Specifically, we conduct pathology detection and classification using Electroencephalography (EEG). Multimodal patient health data, including EEG signals, are recorded using an EEG sensor. Intelligent IoT devices transmit the EEG signals from patients to the cloud, where they undergo processing and are forwarded to a cognitive module. The system tracks various sensor readings, such as facial expressions, speech, EEG, movements, and gestures, to determine the patient's condition. To classify the EEG signals as pathological or normal, our proposed method employs a Transfer Learning-based Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods on the same dataset, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95.13% in identifying EEG pathologies.}

However, to deliver the improvements 5G promises, we need to understand how to enhance capacity and coverage, at reasonable cost, across space and over time. In this paper, we take a spatio-temporal simulation modeling approach, using industry-standard engineering models of 5G wireless networks, to test how different infrastructure strategies perform under scenarios of uncertain future demand. We use coupled open-source models to analyze a UK growth corridor, a system-of-cities comprising 7 urban areas, known as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc. We find that population growth has a marginal impact on total demand for 5G (up to 15%), as the main factor driving demand is the increase in per user data consumption resulting mainly from video. Additionally, the results suggest only limited justification for deploying 5G based purely on the need for more capacity. Strategies which reuse existing brownfield Macro Cell sites are enough to meet future demand for Enhanced Mobile Broadband, except in the densest urban areas. While spatio-temporal analysis of infrastructure is common in some sectors (e.g. transport, energy and water), there has been a lack of open analysis of digital infrastructure. This study makes a novel contribution by providing an open and reproducible spatio-temporal assessment of different 5G technologies at a time when 5G is starting to roll-out around the world.}

Remote medical support, commodities transportation within due time, live-action movies, cinematography, distant communication support, and many other provisions are provided by drones right now. However, the selection of drones for a particular job is quite sensitive and not all drones are feasible for any job. In this case, we need to scientifically assess and confirm drone performance in logistics and transportation. In this study, we present a Bayesian Network (BN) approach to predict the overall performance of drone technology through four prime criteria (factors), namely: physical specification, technical responses, functional performance, and economic cost. To that end, we have developed a Bayesian network approach to portray the causal relationships between the various factors that affect drone selection based on their performance, and subsequently, predicted the posterior probability of drone performance conditioned upon the aforementioned salient criteria. To evaluate the model further, a number of analyses, such as Bayesian inference algorithm (belief propagation) and sensitivity analyses have been carried out. The results show that when the physical specification criteria are met, the economic factor is most imperious to the overall performance of the drone, followed by functional performance and technical responsiveness. This research would invoke richer dialogue for the researchers and practitioners to select and use suitable drones and develop subsequent policies for different transportation scenarios under uncertainty.}

This study explores how the perception of government employees shapes the willingness to support the use of AI technologies in government. Based on a survey data on current government employees in the U.S., our analysis reveals that the willingness to implement and use AI technologies in government was contingent upon a series of positive and negative perceptions about the new technologies, long-term outlook on the role of AI technologies in society, and the familiarity and experience in using some form of AI applications in the past. In particular, the perception of AI enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the work and a positive and longer-term outlook on AI's future about human labor (as an assistant or a competitor), the perception of the technology's ultimate harm or benefit (does it harm or benefit humanity), its ability to eventually make ethical and moral judgments influenced the willingness to support AI technologies in government. A substantial proportion of the government employees in the survey sample responded that they had experienced using some form of AI applications in their work and this familiarity had a strong positive influence on their support for AI. Our findings point to the importance of training the government employees in AI technologies to improve their understanding and perception about the new technologies as well as their potentials in government that will foster a culture of innovation toward sustainable and impactful digital transformation.}

abstract = {An integrated urban platform is the essential software infrastructure for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning, operation and maintenance. Today such platforms are mostly designed to handle and analyze large and heterogeneous urban data sets from very different domains. Modeling and optimization functionalities are usually not part of the software concepts. However, such functionalities are considered crucial by the authors to develop transformation scenarios and to optimize smart city operation. An urban platform needs to handle multiple scales in the time and spatial domain, ranging from long term population and land use change to hourly or sub-hourly matching of renewable energy supply and urban energy demand. The paper discusses software architecture concepts for data and modeling urban platforms, which allow to analyze and optimize the urban infrastructure with their energy, water and further resources such as food or goods consumption. Building, commerce and industry as well as the transport sector are in the focus of the efficiency and renewable supply analysis. The main driver is to derive zero carbon strategies for cities while including all major sectors of CO2 generation. So far, two software architecture concepts have been implemented and tested, both using a 3D CityGML geometry data model: A workflow management system for city scale building energy modeling using a monthly energy balance calculation method and a micro service orchestration for dynamic building simulation modeling. The GIS based data analysis methodology and building energy workflow modeling method are applied to a case study district in New York City to demonstrate the implementation status and derive CO2 mitigation strategies. The results showed how data gathered from different sources for the relevant sectors can be translated into CO2-emissions. For a district in Brooklyn connected to a large electric substation with electricity monitoring data available, every individual building´s heating and cooling demand was simulated and resulted in a total annual heating demand of 1.72 TWh/a and 0.11 TWh/a of cooling. It could be shown that the building sector cooling demand can by reduced by 63% by a change of set point temperature for cooling and reduced infiltration rate, while reducing the heat demand by 12%. In addition, carbon accounting of the food and wastewater sector was done using the same GIS based modeling framework. The analysis showed that the food related electricity consumption for refrigeration corresponds to about 5% of the overall electricity consumption and requires 2.6 GWh/a for transport. Using food waste in co-digestion of wastewater treatment plants could contribute another 7.4 GWh/a of combined heat and power. Such quantification of demand and energy sources could contribute to prioritize actions for CO2 mitigation strategies in urban areas.}

Moreover, the current status of 6G research is discussed, and a rough roadmap for specification and regulation is explored. Then we describe a few prospective applications, their benefits, concepts, and research directions. We explore the business direction for 6G by introducing the most recently 6G projects in the vertical markets. We also propose a network architectural vision and the evolution of hardware-software designs to satisfy the higher requirements of 6G applications. This paper also presents a comprehensive survey of existing 6G trends, technologies, applications, industrial markets, and network structures for the most promising 6G applications.}

abstract = {Development of sustainable and healthy built environments (SHBE) is highly advocated to achieve collective societal good. Part of the pathway to SHBE is the engagement of robots to manage the ever-complex facilities for tasks such as inspection and disinfection. However, despite the increasing advancements of robot intelligence, it is still “mission impossible” for robots to independently undertake such open-ended problems as facility management, calling for a need to “team up” the robots with humans. Leveraging digital twin's ability to capture real-time data and inform decision-making via dynamic simulation, this study aims to develop a human-robot teaming framework for facility management to achieve sustainability and healthiness in the built environments. A digital twin-enabled prototype system is developed based on the framework. Case studies showed that the framework can safely and efficiently incorporate robotics into facility management tasks (e.g., patrolling, inspection, and cleaning) by allowing humans to plan, oversee, manage, and cooperate with the robot via the digital twin's bi-directional mechanism. The study lays out a high-level framework, under which purposeful efforts can be made to unlock digital twin's full potential in collaborating humans and robots in facility management towards SHBE.}

Our goals are to (1) evaluate input modalities for the drones, derived from an iterative narrowing of the design space, (2) improve our mixed reality system for designing input modalities and training operators, and (3) collect data on how participants socially experience the virtual drones with which they work. In our study, 17 participants played the game with two input modalities (Gesture condition, Tap condition) in counterbalanced order. Results indicated that participants performed best with the Gesture condition. Participants found the multiple controls challenging, and future studies might include more training of the devices and game. Participants felt like a team with the drones and found them moderately agentic. In our future work, we will extend this testing to a more externally valid mixed reality game.}

In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure.}

A designed BFP ontology is considered as the semantic model and basis of data fusion between the static building geometric information and the dynamic sensing data. The above information is incorporated into a DT data model, which is considered as the mapping of physical space. Moreover, rule models and process models are developed to achieve intelligent control mechanisms and keep the DT data model synced with the physical space. A case study based on a fire accident simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of the use of DTs and semantic web technologies.}

abstract = {Rotorcraft are commonly required to fly at low altitudes and this places them at a high risk of striking various types of obstacles. Wires, in particular, are very difficult to discern and easily blend in the background which explains why wire strikes are a major cause of helicopter accidents. In the context of helicopter operations, a wire hazard is any wire or structure supporting those wires that presents a danger to the aircraft. Data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) shows that wire strikes were responsible for 124 fatalities between 1994 and 2018. Data on civil helicopter wire strikes further show that the majority of helicopter models involved fall in the lightweight category. In this study, existing aircraft-mounted and ground-based wire strike prevention and protection technologies are reviewed, along with some other potential technologies that have not been specifically developed for use on helicopters but that might be able to prevent wire strikes. In particular, commercially available wire detection systems such as laser scanning systems, database-dependent warning systems, wire cutters, radar scanners and aerial markers are surveyed and evaluated against each other. Publicly available databases of transmission lines in the U.S. are identified and documented for the development of wire strike prevention technologies for lightweight helicopters. The feasibility of creating useful maps of wires from tabulated data or image data is discussed and various Electronic Flight Bag manufacturers are surveyed and compared to determine the feasibility of integrating and displaying such information in the cockpit. Challenges of implementing safety devices, in particular wire cutters, on lightweight helicopters are also discussed and recommendations are provided to improve helicopter wire strike safety. Finally, a multi-criteria decision-making analysis is carried out to rank wire strike safety devices and compare the robustness of their rankings with respect to various operator's preference scenarios. It is shown that the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), the Wire Strike Protection System (WSPS), the Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS), and the wire markers perform best regardless of the scenario.}

This study puts a focus on the specific geographic location of Southeast Europe (SEE), intending to fill the gap in understanding the research advances in this part of Europe. The aim of this descriptive review was to systematically investigate peer-reviewed publications focused on SC research in SEE in order to present the findings and the state-of-art in this research domain. Seventy-four papers were thoroughly studied, analysed and classified based on their focus on SC themes and common sub-themes. While smart governance had been studied extensively in the SEE region, topics related to the smart economy and smart people received low attention from researchers. Mapping the selected papers to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle showed that SC research in SEE is still in the conceptualising and planning stages, with very little evidence from the real implementation and follow-up activities. From the stakeholders’ perspective, the focus is on the institutional point of view as most of the papers present their findings in relation to (national or local) government bodies or policies, without balancing with corresponding businesses’ or individuals’ (users’) point of view. In general, user involvement was found to be very low in regards to current SC research in the SEE region.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

abstract = {Background
Mobile phone use while driving is a well-recognized area of concern. However, while texting/calling among young adult drivers has received much research attention, more research is needed regarding other phone functions used by young adults while driving.
Study aim
To explore mobile phone functions used by young adult drivers while driving.
Results
An online survey of 17–24 year old drivers (N = 612; 428 females) and focus groups with drivers aged (N = 18; 8 females) revealed that mobile phone use while driving was a very common behavior, with more full licence drivers compared with Learner/Provisional drivers using their phone to make/answer calls, send/read text messages and for internet browsing. This nature of mobile phone use while driving was varied, with phones commonly used for entertainment (e.g., to play music), to connect with others (via texting and/or voice calls) and for navigation.
Concluding remarks
Young adults use a variety of functions on their phone while driving. It is important that young driver-targeted intervention efforts acknowledge that multiple functions of the mobile phone are used during the drive and it serves multiple purposes. Examining the inhibitors and facilitators of mobile phone use and its various functions while driving is needed, in addition to elucidating if the usage of particular mobile phone functions is similar across different driver cohorts.}

We document here a multidisciplinary experimental study in which a bespoke VR crime scene app was designed and implemented, after which it was tested by both undergraduate student and staff/postgraduate student cohorts. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that VR applications support learning of practical crime scene processing skills. VR-based practical sessions have the potential to add value to forensic science courses, through offering cost-effective practical experience, the ability to work in isolation and in a variety of different scenarios. Both user groups reported high levels of satisfaction with using the app and reports of adverse effects (motion sickness) were minimal. With reference to user feedback, we proceed to evaluate the scalability and development challenges associated with large-scale implementation of VR as an adjunct to forensic science education.}

We chose a turtle as our first host animal and designed a parasitic robot that can perform “operant conditioning”. The parasitic robot, which is attached to the turtle, can induce object-tracking behavior of the turtle toward a Light Emitting Diode (LED) and positively reinforce the behavior through repeated stimulus-response interaction. After training sessions over five weeks, the robot could successfully control the direction of movement of the trained turtles in the waypoint navigation task. This hybrid animal-robot interaction system could provide an alternative solution to some of the limitations of conventional mobile robot systems in various fields, and could also act as a useful interaction system for the behavioral sciences.}

However, these resources do need to be carefully constructed and grounded in pedagogic theory to be effective. This article details eXtended Reality (XR) learning and teaching environments to facilitate effective online teaching and learning for forensic geoscientists. The first two case studies discussed in this article make use of Thinglink software to produce virtual learning and teaching XR resources through an internet system, which was delivered to undergraduate students in 2021. Case one details a range of XR virtual laboratory-based equipment resources, providing a consistent, reliable and asynchronous learning and teaching experience, whilst the second case study presents an XR virtual learning applied geophysics resource developed for a 12-week CPD training programme. This programme involves recorded equipment video resources, accompanying datasets and worksheets for users to work through. Both case studies were positively received by learners, but there were issues encountered by learners with poor internet connections or computer skills, or who do not engage well with online learning. A third case study showcases an XR educational forensic geoscience eGame that was developed to take the user through a cold case search investigation, from desktop study through to field reconnaissance and multi-staged site investigations. Pedagogic research was undertaken with user questionnaires and interviews, providing evidence that the eGame was an effective learning and teaching tool. eGame users highly rated the eGame and reported that they raised awareness and understanding of the use of geophysics equipment and best practice of forensic geoscience search phased investigations. These types of XR virtual learning digital resources, whilst costly to produce in terms of development time and staff resource, provide a complementary virtual learning experience to in-situ practical sessions, and allow learners to asynchronously familiarise themselves with equipment, environments and techniques resulting in more efficient use of in situ time. The XR resources also allow learners to reinforce learning post in-situ sessions. Finally, XR resources can provide a more inclusive and authentic experience for learners who cannot attend or complete work synchronously.}

We then checked how such a sense of empowerment among academics explains the presence of information culture in this community and different approaches to information management. The factors of information management and information use were presented as affecting a university's institutional readiness for the new requirements of digital transformation from the perspective of governance issues. The findings highlight that information literacy underlies academics' empowerment and a high level of self-efficacy driven by this literacy can also be indirectly translated into the formation of pro-active information culture that strengthens an academic's position in creating information use outcomes and by making them ready for digital transformation. Through information literacy outcomes the academic libraries can turn out to be an important transformative force in terms of digital changes at universities.}

abstract = {During ship emergencies, a reliable and efficient evacuation system is able to guide passengers to the appropriate muster stations as quickly as possible. The majority of the existing indoor evacuation systems provide emergency guidance for people trapped in general buildings. However, those systems fail to consider the unique challenges of ship passenger evacuation, such as the effect of ship motion on pedestrian motion and the feedback of pedestrian motion on ship inclination state. Consequently, evacuation guidance provided by these schemes may not always be optimal or may even make the evacuation worse due to the differences in the critical factors influencing emergency guiding between land-based buildings and passenger ships. This paper presents a systematic literature overview of recent advances in building evacuation, followed by a description of the challenges unique to evacuating passengers on vessels. Furthermore, the existing ship evacuation research is reviewed from three aspects, i.e., passenger behavior study, ship evacuation optimization, and evaluation of evacuation on passenger ships. A discussion of land-based evacuation schemes and prospects for ship evacuation is also presented.}

In the case of flood evacuation, people have to deal with built environments extremely modified by the floodwaters and that hence influences human-environment interactions both from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint. In this sense, the observation of real events is fundamental to define behavioral patterns and their relation to floodwater conditions. To this end, in this work, we analyzed 139 videotapes of recent real-world flood evacuations in outdoor Built Environments involving about 1000 people all over the World (the largest set analyzed so far). The frequencies of behavioral patterns are associated with water depth (measured with respect to ankles, knees, and waist), flow (i.e., still or flowing), and evacuation phase in which they are observed (that is before, during, and after the evacuation). Specific factors like voluntariness, human response, and presence of reference elements in the flooded built environment are also considered. Frequent by-literature behaviors have been considered, and new-noticed ones have been assessed. Results unveil that the most frequent floodwater conditions and thresholds to trigger each behavior concern waters between the ankles and the waist, thus excluding slight and extreme interactions with floodwater. The retrieved behavioral patterns could be employed to develop and validate behavioral models for flood evacuation simulators, and to create critical scenarios for people’s training. Furthermore, they trace quick insights to help safety planners in the design of risk-reduction measures also considering local and/or temporary risks due to the floodwater conditions.}

Many researchers have concentrated on classifying micro-expressions in different discrete emotion classes, while detecting the presence of micro-expression in the video frames is considered as a pre-requisite step in the recognition process. Hence, there is a need to introduce more advanced detection models for micro-expressions. In order to address this, we propose a dual attention network based micro-expression detection architecture called LGAttNet. LGAttNet is one of the first to utilize a dual attention network grouped with 2-dimensional convolutional neural network to perform frame-wise automatic micro-expression detection. This method divides the feature extraction and enhancement task into two different convolutional neural network modules; sparse module and feature enhancement module. One of the key modules in our approach is the attention network which extracts local and global facial features, namely local attention module and global attention module. The attention mechanism adopts the human characteristic of focusing on the specific regions of micro-movements, which enables the LGAttNet to concentrate on particular facial regions along with the full facial features to identify the micro-expressions in the frames. Experiments performed on widely used publicly available databases demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our LGAttNet when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.}

Currently, commercial computer games there are few options of software and sufficiently flexible access devices to meet the needs of this group of children. In this study, a peripheral access device and a 3D computerized game that do not require the actions of dragging, clicking, or activating various keys at the same time were developed. The peripheral access device consists of a webcam and a supervisory system that processes the images. This method provides a field of action that can be adjusted to various types of motor impairments. To analyze the sensitivity of the commands, a virtual course was developed using the scenario of a path of straight lines and curves. A volunteer with good ability in virtual games performed a short training with the virtual course and, after 15min of training, obtained similar results with a standard keyboard and the adapted peripheral device. A 3D game in the Amazon forest was developed using the Blender 3D tool. This free software was used to model the characters and scenarios. To evaluate the usability of the 3D game, the game was tested by 20 volunteers without motor impairments (group A) and 13 volunteers with severe motor limitations of the upper limbs (group B). All the volunteers (group A and B) could easily execute all the actions of the game using the adapted peripheral device. The majority positively evaluated the questions of usability and expressed their satisfaction. The computerized game coupled to the adapted device will offer the option of leisure and learning to people with severe motor impairments who previously lacked this possibility. It also provided equality in this activity to all the users.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) tsunami, public embracement, and the ubiquitous adoption of smart devices are affecting virtually every industry, directly or indirectly. The success of the current and future landscape of IoT and connected devices requires service provision characterized by scalability, ubiquity, reliability, and high-performance, among others. In order to achieve this attribution, the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing (CC), known as cloud IoT, has emerged as a new paradigm providing advanced services specific to aggregating, storing, and processing data generated by IoT. While the convergence of IoT and Cloud brings opportunities, it suffers from specific limitations such as bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The increasing need for supporting interaction between cloud and IoT led to Edge and Fog Computing (FC) in which computing and storage resources are located not only in the cloud but also at the edges near the source of data. The hierarchical and collaborative edge–fog–cloud architecture brings tremendous benefits as it enables us to distribute the intelligence and computation – including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and big data analytics – to achieve an optimal solution while satisfying the given constraints e.g., delay-energy tradeoff. Due to the hierarchical, cross-layer, and distributed nature of this model, achieving an osmotic and effective convergence of IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing requires overcoming many challenges with respect to design and implementation, as well as deployment and evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive insight into the edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm by providing a blend of discussions on all important aspects of the underlying technologies to offer opportunities for more holistic studies and to accelerate knowledge acquisition. To gain a deep understanding of edge–fog–cloud, we will begin this paper by providing an in-depth tutorial and presenting the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, building blocks, components, protocols, applications, and other similar computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Following this, a holistic reference architecture for edge–fog–cloud IoT is presented and the major corresponding design and deployment considerations (e.g., service models, infrastructure design, provisioning, resource allocation, offloading, service migration, performance evaluation, and security concerns) are discussed. Next, we will take a look at the role of privacy-preserving, distributed, and collaborative analytics as well as the interaction between edge, fog, and cloud computing. Finally, we will overview the main challenges in the field of edge–fog–cloud computing that need to be tackled to realize the full potential of IoT.}

Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees’ final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees’ trace data through a visualization tool to pose non-observable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees’ final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.}

Advanced wireless functionality enables new applications and services based on smart, physical, network infrastructures, many of them expected to be localized. As a general-purpose technology, 5G can be configured in numerous ways to support innovative applications across many sectors. Smart network applications and services must integrate physical and virtual components in innovative ways. In addition, general capabilities of 5G must be combined with complementary technologies, such as big data analytics and edge cloud services, to create services for specific use cases. Varying throughput and latency requirements of distinct use cases require differentiated technical solutions. Appropriate frequencies must be aligned efficiently with other features within the footprint of particular, local industrial networks. National policy makers, suppliers, and users are responding differently to these governance and management challenges. These approaches balance differently the trade-offs between experimentation, differentiation, and harmonization. Comparative analysis can inform gradual improvements of the governance of 5G-based, local industrial networks.}

To this end, we propose a data-efficient, end-to-end neural network model for generic, unconstrained text recognition.

We show the generality and superiority of our proposed text recognition architecture by achieving state-of-the-art results on seven public benchmark datasets, covering a wide spectrum of text recognition tasks, namely: Handwriting Recognition, CAPTCHA recognition, OCR, License Plate Recognition, and Scene Text Recognition.

abstract = {Background
Simulation-based nursing training has been used incorporated into nursing education for decades, however, there is limited information related to simulation research hotspots and theme trends over time.
Objectives
To investigate the research hotspots and theme trends of simulation in nursing education through bibliometric analysis.
Methods
Relevant articles on simulation in nursing education published between 2005 and 2019 were retrieved from PubMed. The Bibliographic Item Co-occurrence Matrix Builder (BICOMB) was used to extract and quantitatively analyze the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and subheadings. The biclustering analysis was conducted using gCluto1.0 to identify the research hotspots. A strategic diagram was employed to reveal the development trend of the theme.
Results
A total of 4102 publications were retrieved from PubMed showing an overall increasing trend. Based on the results, the United States was the most productive country (2868,55.7 %), the journal Nurse Education Today journal was the top journal concerning this field, and Cooper SJ and Holtschneider ME were authors with the highest number of publications on this topic. Quantitative and co-word biclustering analyses were used in this study. The research hotspots in recent 5 years were focused on: (1) interprofessional simulation in patient-care teams; (2) patient simulation in psychiatric nursing education; (3) virtual reality simulation (VRS) in midwifery and nursing education; (4) simulation in critical care nurses' continuing education/training, and (5) simulation in pediatric resuscitation education. The strategic diagram showed that the VRS in midwifery and nursing education might have a significant potential to become an emerging hotspot soon.
Conclusion
The research literature production of simulation in nursing education was increasing over the past 15 years. Through co-word biclustering analysis, five research hotspots were identified. Among them, simulation in psychiatric education and critical care continuing education had a central priority that researchers should pay further attention to, and VRS could be the major trend for future study. Furthermore, this study described the overall range of research interests and provided ideas for innovative and efficient research projects.}

In this study, international and domestic stakeholder inputs on the future role of smart ICT in advancing Australia's infrastructure development and operations were crowdsourced for analysis. The study identifies several forms of smart ICT (e.g. building information modelling software) enabled infrastructure that possesses potential to deliver over A$9 billion per annum in domestic economic improvements, with commensurate advancement of communities, regions and urban environments. However, to be effective these smart ICT require enablement through open and interoperable data, sound governance and policy, and government leadership and coordination using dedicated resources. While smart infrastructure development is presently slow and lumbering, the identified smart ICT present as valuable strategic technologies for change and development in domestic communities.}

abstract = {In the state of Florida, climate change and unpredictable weather disasters have put pressure on the state and local decision-makers to adopt swift and efficient Post-Disaster recovery plans. Part of such recovery plans includes rebuilding businesses and housing. However, projects that include the reconstructing and restoring of the damaged buildings are complicated and time-consuming. Throughout the state of Florida, the Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) currently assist with the inspections of existing structures' safety and also issue construction permits for rebuilding or repairing. Regardless of the adaption of various policies and strategies by many governmental entities, innovative methods must be developed to reduce further risks after disasters by creating resilient built environments. This paper seeks to address the issues of Post-Disaster rebuilding. The research presents the significance of adopting a new Virtual Permitting Framework (VPF) to improve the efficiency of obtaining the construction permit in Post-Disaster recovery efforts. The paper explores the current permitting process during Post-Disasters, the impact of the permitting process on the progress of recovery strategies and proposes an innovative system to enhance the rebuilding process using Building Information Modeling (BIM).}

The EST can take the form of a push trolley or of an autonomous mobile platform. The Autonomous EST (AEST) has been designed to provide an integrated solution for automating the creation of complete models. Embedded software performs several functions, including triangulation of the range data, registration of video texture, registration and integration of data acquired from different capture points. Potential applications include facilities management for the construction industry and creating reality models to be used in general areas of virtual reality, for example, virtual studios, virtualised reality for content-related applications (e.g., CD-ROMs), social telepresence, architecture and others. The paper presents the main components of the EST/AEST, and presents some example results obtained from the prototypes. The reconstructed model is encoded in VRML format so that it is possible to access and view the model via the World Wide Web.}

However, the time-varying communication link environment of signal occlusion and interference between MDs and edge servers often leads to disappointing offloading benefits. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is recognized as a promising technology in sixth-generation communication networks, with great potential to intelligently adjust the phase shift and amplitude of reflective elements to enhance wireless network capabilities. This paper proposes a novel computation offloading algorithm for RIS empowered MEC networks. Specifically, we comprehensively consider the optimization problems of delay, energy consumption, and operator cost in the process of computation offloading, and model it as a Markov decision process. To overcome the continuous action space challenge, we propose a computation offloading algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to jointly optimize the phase shift and amplitude of RIS, offloading decision, and MEC resource allocation strategy. Finally, compared with various other benchmark algorithms, our proposed algorithm has a significant performance improvement over non-RIS learning algorithms and other classical algorithms, and maintains the optimal performance.}

abstract = {With the increase of service years, external walls of high-rise buildings tend to suffer from a variety of defects which impose great safety risks. Traditional methods for inspecting high-rise building external walls require inspectors to work at height and identify defects manually, which is dangerous and inefficient. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for inspecting building external walls, but how to manage the information obtained by the UAV is still a problem. In addition, although building information modelling (BIM) with rich geometric and semantic information has been applied in the construction engineering industry, BIM models usually lack updated condition data of facilities. Therefore, this paper presents a method for managing the inspection results of building external walls by mapping defect data from UAV images to BIM models and modelling defects as BIM objects. First, images of building external walls obtained by UAV are processed and useful information such as coordinates are extracted. Considering the small scale of single buildings, a simplified coordinate transformation approach is developed to transform location of real-world defects to coordinates in the BIM model. Meanwhile, a deep learning-based instance segmentation model is developed to detect defects in the captured images and extract their features. In the end, the identified defects are modelled as new objects with detailed information and mapped to the corresponding location of the related BIM component. To validate the feasibility, the proposed method has been applied to a real office building, which successfully mapped and integrated the defects of external walls with the BIM model. This study is applicable to both buildings and infrastructure, and is expected to facilitate structure inspection and decision making in maintenance with integrated data of as-is condition and as-built BIM.}

However, navigational ease is not always considered when buildings are designed, making wayfinding a difficult and frustrating experience. Moreover, existing solutions are expensive, highly specialized, or both. In this work, we examine how a system of connected low-cost displays designed as an open API can be leveraged to guide users to their destinations quickly, easily, and with minimal cognitive load. Following a formative survey (N=58), we designed: (i) a system of linked, low-fidelity indicators, (ii) a novel map ingestion mechanism for quick and easy deployment, and (iii) a framework for controlling and interacting with an ecosystem of mixed-fidelity devices. We then evaluated our system through a controlled user experiment (N=18) that explores the impact of indicator density and route complexity on performance. Our work shows low-cost embedded indicators can improve indoor navigational experiences by delivering many of the same benefits as more costly solutions, we argue that such indicators would complement existing navigational solutions in a mixed-fidelity ecosystem, and we discuss use-cases as well as design recommendations for deploying similar systems.}

With the substantial increase in the number of egocentric videos, the value and utility of recognizing actions of the wearer in such videos has also thus increased. Unstructured movement of the camera due to natural head motion of the wearer causes sharp changes in the visual field of the egocentric camera causing many standard third person action recognition techniques to perform poorly on such videos. Objects present in the scene and hand gestures of the wearer are the most important cues for first person action recognition but are difficult to segment and recognize in an egocentric video. We propose a novel representation of the first person actions derived from feature trajectories. The features are simple to compute using standard point tracking and do not assume segmentation of hand/objects or recognizing object or hand pose unlike in many previous approaches. We train a bag of words classifier with the proposed features and report a performance improvement of more than 11% on publicly available datasets. Although not designed for the particular case, we show that our technique can also recognize wearer's actions when hands or objects are not visible.}

The participants (n = 30) were asked to complete wayfinding tasks of varying difficulty in a virtual reality (VR) hospital environment. Time segments when participants experienced navigational uncertainty were first identified using a combination of objective measurements (frequency of inputs into the VR controller) and behavioral annotations from two independent observers. Uncertainty time-segments during navigation were ranked on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high). The machine-learning model, a Random Forest classifier implemented using scikit-learn in Python, was used to evaluate common spatial patterns of EEG spectral power across the theta, alpha, and beta bands associated with the researcher-identified uncertainty states. The overall predictive power of the resulting model was 0.70 in terms of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC-AUC). These findings indicate that EEG data can potentially be used as a metric for identifying navigational uncertainty states, which may provide greater rigor and efficiency in studies of human responses to architectural design variables and wayfinding cues.}

abstract = {Increase in urbanization drives the need for municipalities to make mobility more efficient, both to address climate goals as well as creating a smart living environment for citizens, with less noise congestion, and pollution. As vehicles are being electrified, further advances will be needed to meet social, environmental, and economic sustainability targets, and a more efficient use of vehicles and public transport is central in this endeavor. Accordingly, Electric Mobility as a Service (eMaaS) has developed as a concept with the potential to increase sustainability mobility in cities and been designated as a phenomenon with potential to radically change how people move in the future. But presently there is the lack of a common business model that supports complex integration of all actors, digital technologies, and infrastructures involved in the eMaaS business ecosystem. This study aims to support the further development of eMaaS by providing a state of the art of eMaaS and further proposes a digital ecosystem as a business model for eMaaS sharing in smart cities. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was adopted grounded on secondary data from the literature to offers a new approach to urban mobility and demonstrate the suitability of the eMaaS concept in smart communities. The digital ecosystem is designed based on system design approach. Findings from this study provides a sustainable policy perspective, discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development of eMaaS and its impact on electrification of vehicles. Overall, findings from this study considers the role of electric vehicles as part of the mobility sharing economy. Recommendations from this study provides designs and strategies for eMaaS, the interrelations between eMobility and other everyday practices, strategically highlighting the positive benefits of eMaaS and broader policies to limit private car usage in cities.}

Based on an in-depth qualitative study and on interviews with experts, the analysis section summarizes the way in which the AI innovation ecosystem in China is being built, which are the key features of the three spheres of the Triple Helix -governments, industry and academic/research institutions-as well as the dynamic context of the ecosystem through the identification of main aspects related to the flows of skills, knowledge and funding and the interactions among them. Using this approach, the discussion section illustrates the specificities of the AI innovation ecosystem in China, its strengths and its gaps, and which are its prospects. Overall, this revisited ecosystem approach permits the authors to address the complexity of emerging environments of innovation to draw meaningful conclusions which are not possible with mere observation. The results show how a favourable context, the broad adoption rate and the competition for talent and capital among regional-specialized clusters are boosting the advance of AI in China, mainly in the business to customer arena. Finally, the paper highlights the challenges ahead in the current implementation of the ecosystem that will largely determine the potential global leadership of China in this domain.}

The software tool VOSviewer was used to build the keyword co-occurrence network and to cluster the pertinent literature. Results show the significant growth of IoT research in recent years. The most productive authors, journals, and countries were also identified. The main findings from the keyword co-occurrence clustering and an in-depth qualitative analysis indicate that the IoT is used alongside other technologies including cloud computing, big data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and wireless telecommunication networks. The major applications of the IoT for smart cities include smart buildings, transportation, healthcare, smart parking, and smart grids. This review is one of the first attempts to map global IoT research in a smart city context and uses a comprehensive set of articles and bibliometric techniques to provide scholars and practitioners with an overview of what has been studied so far and to identify research gaps at the intersection of the IoT and the smart city.}

In our earlier work, a deep learning framework based on facial action units (AUs) was proposed to emphasize both local and global features to deal with the MaEs and MEs spotting tasks. In this paper, an advanced Concat-CNN model is proposed to not only utilize facial action units (AU) features, which our previous work proved were more effective in detecting MaEs, but also to fuse the optical flow features to improve the detection performance of MEs. The advanced Concat-CNN proposed in this paper not only considers the intra-features correlation of a single frame but also the inter-features correlation between frames. Further, we devise a new adaptive re-labeling method by labeling the emotional frames with distinctive scores. This method takes into account the dynamic changes in expressions to further improve the overall detection performance. Compared with our earlier work and several existing works, the newly proposed deep learning pipeline is able to achieve a better performance in terms of the overall F1-scores: 0.2623 on CAS(ME)2, 0.2839 on CAS(ME)2-cropped, and 0.3241 on SAMM-LV, respectively.}

Consequently, a tremendous data count has been generated with an enormous number of mobile phones due to these applications. This has made remarkable challenges and has a considerable influence on the network slicing performance. This work aims to design an efficient network slicing using a hybrid learning algorithm. Thus, we proposed a model, which involves three main phases: (a) Data collection, (b) Optimal weighted feature extraction (OWFE), and (c) Slicing classification. First, we collected the 5G network slicing dataset, which involves the attributes associated with various network devices like “user device type, duration, packet loss ratio, packet delay budget, bandwidth, delay rate, speed, jitter, and modulation type.” Next, we performed the OWFE, in which a weight function is multiplied with the attribute values to have high scale variation. We optimized this weight function by the hybridization of two meta-heuristic algorithms—glowworm swarm optimization and deer hunting optimization algorithm (DHOA)—and named the proposed model glowworm swarm-based DHOA (GS-DHOA). For the given attributes, we classified the exact network slices like “eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC” for each device by a hybrid classifier using deep belief and neural networks. The weight function of both networks is optimized by the GS-DHOA. The experiment results revealed that the proposed model could influence the provision of accurate 5G network slicing.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.}

As an entry-point into this question, it proposes and explores the concept of post-normal engineering. Using the driverless car as a microcosm of the smart city, Part One of the paper explores two dimensions of post-normal engineering—the acceptance of negotiated risk and the dependence on open innovation—in order to bring out how these environments are associated with disequilibrium and uncertainty. The second part of the paper offers a comparison of two virtue-oriented approaches, one by Dale Jamieson and the other by Michel Puech, for living well under such conditions. Part Three argues that, under such conditions, virtues of the kind they identify as important to cultivate under these conditions need to be supplemented with virtues of a different, disequilibrating, order, and suggests attuned spontaneity and informal generosity as two examples. A brief conclusion traces some implications of the idea of “disequilibrating” virtue for technological design.}

A large set of possible collapse patterns is generated before the earthquake. After the event, the pattern with geometry most similar to that of the ‘as-damaged’ exterior BIM can be selected rapidly. This paper details the selection methods, which use least sum of point distances and Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) algorithms, and illustrates their operation on a series of simulated computer models of collapsed structures, thus demonstrating the potential feasibility of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {The pandemic has severely disrupted the activity and economic growth of co-working spaces, ridesharing, couch surfing, and other services known collectively as the “sharing economy.” Academicians and managers are exploring and experimenting with various strategies to recover losses, build meaningful connections with consumers, and optimize consumer engagement. As the sharing economy strives to recover from pandemic-induced losses, it is crucial to consider factors that might help sharing-economy firms navigate through difficult times. Moreover, value-co creation has been addressed previously in sharing economy research as a unidimensional construct with constrained applicability. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response (S–O-R) framework, the present study focuses on ethical marketing as a strategy for identifying consumer responses—including value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay—that may benefit sharing-economy firms. We have collected the empirical data from n = 403 consumers in the sharing economy. Analyses through structural equation modelling tests reveal that ethical marketing influence value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay. Contrary to our expectations, value co-creation has no influence on consumers' willingness to pay; however, the relationship between value co-creation and consumers' willingness to pay is fully mediated by self–brand connection. Based on empirical results, this study contributes to existing theoretical knowledge regarding ethical marketing and value co-creation literature in the sharing economy and proposes practical implications, including how consumers would be willing to co-create value, establish a self–brand connection, and are more likely to pay in response to ethical marketing.}

One disaster communication platform that is ideal for testing the potential effects of visuals on helping publics protect themselves during disasters is Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs). WEAs are 90-character warnings issued by governments and sent by wireless carriers to individuals (for free) facing an imminent threat such as a tornado or flood. The U.S. government is considering adding maps to future WEAs. Maps are one of the most relied-on tools for people to quickly gain knowledge about spatial tasks such as evacuating during disasters. Consequently, this paper empirically tests how at-risk publics respond to warning messages with and without maps. We do so through two experiments (N1=767, N2=550) of U.S. adults testing three disasters: a tsunami, an active shooter incident, and a radiological disaster.}

The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.}

Meanwhile, the wide range of appearance flexibility results in more similar-looking, confusing images, which is the weakness of the widely used retrieval methods. In this work, we shed light on how to handle these similar images. Specifically, we propose a novel retrieval-verification framework. Given an image, the retrieval module will search for a shot list of similar images quickly. Our proposed verification network will then compare the probe image with these candidate images by contrasting local details for their similarity scores. An innovative ranking strategy is also introduced to achieve a good balance between retrieval and verification results. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our framework and its capability in improving the state-of-the-art methods remarkably on both synthetic and realistic datasets.}

To understand the impact of wayfinding challenges on patient hospital visitation experience, organizational costs, and emerging technology trends that may alleviate wayfinding challenges.
Design
A review of literature on the relationship of wayfinding to patient's hospital visitation experience.
Methods
A literature search identifying issues associated with wayfinding challenges in complex health care facilities was conducted. Case examples are provided to illustrate that the removal of barriers can improve the wayfinding experience. This review also informs technology trends that may effectively facilitate wayfinding in complex health care facilities.
Findings
Large hospital complexes exhibit many characteristics comparable to the physical features of a city environment. These complexities present challenges to patients to navigate to their destinations. An effective wayfinding system is a collection of tools that combines permanent signage, printed information, landmarks, architectural features and design elements, and human interactions. Navigational technology modeling holds the promise to aid patients and individuals with visual and cognitive challenges to find their way to their desired destinations effectively and efficiently, and improves their quality of life.
Conclusions
Improved patient travel time correlates to reduce idled nursing time, with cost savings accrued to organization. Research shows that wayfinding mobile applications hold the promise of improving patients' hospital visitation experience.}

The nature of the walking surface itself also has a strong affect on an appropriate gait. Much work is currently underway in improving humanoid walking gaits by dealing with sloping, debris-filled, or otherwise unstable surfaces. Travel on slippery surfaces such as ice, for example, greatly increases the potential speed of a human, but reduces stability. Humans can compensate for this lack of stability through the adaptation of footwear such as skates, and the development of gaits that allow fast but controlled travel on such footwear. This paper describes the development of a gait to allow a small humanoid robot to propel itself on ice skates across a smooth surface, and includes work with both ice skates and inline skates. The new gait described in this paper relies entirely on motion in the frontal plane to propel the robot, and allows the robot to traverse indoor and outdoor ice surfaces more stably than a classic inverted pendulum-based walking gait when using the same skates. This work is demonstrated using Jennifer, a modified Robotis DARwIn-OP humanoid robot with 20 degrees of freedom.}

It is therefore essential that wireless connectivity can be delivered in a cost-efficient way by Mobile Network Operators, for the benefit of all digital ecosystem actors. The contribution of this paper is to analyse the capacity, coverage and cost of different enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) infrastructure strategies, as the industry moves towards integrating new 5G spectrum bands and densifying existing networks. Both a supply-driven and demand-driven investment analysis is undertaken using a case study of the Netherlands. The supply-driven analysis estimates the capacity that can be provided to users via new spectrum, before network densification via small cells is required. The demand-driven analysis tests a range of required per user speeds including 30, 100 or 300 Mbps and quantifies the performance of investment strategies in meeting this demand. The key contribution is estimating the traffic threshold delivered per user from integrating 5G spectrum bands on the existing Dutch macrocell network. Based on the inputs of this analysis, we find that 5G spectrum bands provide an average per user traffic capacity improvement of approximately 40% for the Netherlands in comparison with the existing LTE capacity.}

The authenticity of the learning experience increases when learning is situated in a context akin to the real world, and realistic learning experiences are created by carefully designing the learning tasks, context, and environment. The fidelity of a learning task's psychological, physical, functional, and social aspects and environment is the design attributes that contribute to the authenticity of the learning experience. The social context, or the social environment during learning, is essential in engaging learners in authentic learning tasks. In this mixed-method study, we investigate whether the collaborative nature of the learning activities, the authentic design of the learning experience and tasks, and the social environment impact the learner's perceptions of their learning experience and confidence in learning transfer. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and then together through triangulation. The findings of this study suggest that learners perceived the tasks and environment as realistic and the learning activities' collaborative aspect as helpful. The authentic learning environment did not significantly impact learners' confidence to transfer. However, the experience led to valuable metacognitive reflection and change in self-efficacy beliefs about their learning and practice needs. This experience may result in better self-regulation in long-term learning. This paper presents the findings of this study and discusses future research implications.}

For this, ubiquitous computing technology is introduced to provide all users with any service, anytime, anywhere, with any device, and under any network. However, high cost, long time consumption, extensive effort, and in some cases irrevocability are the main challenges and difficulties for developing ubiquitous systems. Therefore, one solution is to initially simulate, analyze, and validate practices prior to deploying sensing and computational devices in the real world. Simulation, as a performance evaluation technique, has attracted attentions due to its speed, cost-effectiveness, repeatability, scalability, flexibility, and ease of implementation. Moreover, emulation, as a hybrid method, not only offers most simulation advantages but also benefits from tight control of implementation, as well as a certain degree of realistic results. Both simulators and emulators are significant tools for enhancing the understanding of ubiquitous sensor networks (USNs) through testing and analyzing several scenarios prior to actual sensor placements. In this regard, this paper surveys 130 simulation and emulation environments and frameworks, which were originally designed and adapted for USN. Of these 130, the 22 that have been widely used, regularly updated, and well supported by their developers are compared based on multifarious criteria. Finally, several studies that had favorably compared the performance of simulators and/or emulators are examined. We believe the present research findings will be helpful for students and researchers to pick an appropriate simulator/emulator, and for software developers and those who are keen on producing their own environment.}

In a context of industry lobbying of governments to promote 5G, the paper attempts to bring clarity to just what are the critical issues, specifically for an industrial policy to deal with this novel but complex technology. Planning for 5G is a series of complicated choices as there are issues at the levels of creating ecosystems to support it, unproven business models, with claims for applications which may not be financially viable, yet, plus confusion over choices of radio spectrum, and selection of equipment suppliers, even potential issues over public health, as well as the real level of industrial and consumer demand beyond the hype. The emphasis here is on the importance of making balanced strategic choices, by identifying the basic issues, in a ‘realpolitik’ fashion - including why embrace 5G at all. The paper develops its insights from lessons learnt in the introduction of the previous mobile generation, LTE, also from policy studies on small cells and on designing auctions for 5G networks, as well as various 5G-focused publications from governments, regulatory authorities, mobile industry associations and global suppliers over the past six years (2015–2020). It examines whether to regulate 5G deployment with a heavy or light-touch regime, also whether to focus on more than the traditional indicators, such as penetration and coverage, or on “transformational outcomes” (as the promotional literature terms them) for the private and public sectors.}

To eliminate the redundancy of the traffic video, the magnitude of motion detection based on spatio-temporal interest points (STIP) and the multi-modal linear features combination are presented which splits a video into super frame segments of interests. After that, we select the key frames from these interesting segments of the long videos with the design and detection of the prominent region.

Based on a comprehensive literature review of 796 systematically retrieved articles, the current study proposes a multilayered technology-organisation-environment (TOE-based) risk management framework for sustainable smart city governance. A total of 56 risks are identified and grouped into TOE categories. There are 17 technological risks, including IoT networks, public internet management and user safety concerns, with a 38.7% contribution to smart city governance risks. With a 15.6% share, there are 11 organisational risks, including user data security and cloud management. There are 28 external risks with a contribution of 46.7% to the smart city governance and consist of smart city's environment, governance, integration and security risks. A multilayered TOE-based risk management framework is proposed to identify and manage the risks associated with smart city governance in the current study. The framework links smart citizens to each other through the smart city governance team and the integrated TOE layers. The iterative risk management process of identification, analysis, evaluation, monitoring and response planning is carried out in the TOE layers, both at the external layer levels and internal management levels. The proposed framework operationalises the risk management process for smart city governance by presenting the collection of pertinent risks and their thematic TOE categorisation. The criticality of the identified risks in line with the study's rankings can help researchers and practitioners understand the top risks of smart city governance. These risks present investment opportunities for city governance bodies to develop critical and effective responses as well as provide safety, security and enhanced privacy for citizens.}
