abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band is one of the most promising aspects of wireless communication systems because of its potential to meet the growing demands for the envisioned next-generation of cellular communications. THz band connectivity can alleviate bandwidth shortages and transmit power constraints using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To obtain better throughput and enhanced spectral efficiency, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) configuration can be incorporated into MIMO systems, as NOMA uses non-orthogonal resource allocation by assigning the same carrier frequency to multiple devices in the power domain. In this paper, we focus on 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA and cooperative 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA systems for THz spectrum in the downlink transmission. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture, we derive accurate data rate, transmission latency, and reliability expressions for 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA system consists of critical and non-critical devices by leveraging finite block length theory. Moreover, we derive the closed-form expressions for power splitting coefficients, data rate, transmission latency, and reliability for the considered cooperative 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA system. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA as well as the cooperative 2 × 1 MIMO-NOMA systems in the THz band.}

Despite the potential benefits of I4.0 technologies in operations management reported in the extant literature, there has been a paucity of empirical research examining the intention to adopt I4.0 technologies for managing risks. Risk management identifies, assesses, and introduces responses for risks to avert crises. This study combines institutional theory, the resource-based view and the technology acceptance model to develop a novel behavioural model examining the adoption of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and blockchain for risk management from the operations manager's perspective, which has never been examined in the literature. The model was tested for each I4.0 technology using data collected from 117 operations managers in the UK manufacturing industry which were analysed using structural equation modelling. We contribute to the theory on I4.0 in digital manufacturing by showing the impact of digital transformation maturity, market pressure, regulations, and resilience on the perceived usefulness and adoption of these technologies for managing risks in business operations. Based on the findings, we discuss implications for operations managers effectively and efficiently to adopt I4.0 technologies aiming to boost operational productivity.}

abstract = {Developments in hardware and software have led to new innovative methods for visualising geospatial data. At the same time user-centred design (UCD) and usability engineering methods have a fundamental role in designing applications for new technical environments, which involve entirely new ways of interacting. However, applying methods from other research disciplines may not always be straightforward, as the product developers have to operate in a challenging interdisciplinary field. The aim of this study was to find out how usability engineering is currently included in the development of map services. Seven companies developing different types of map applications in Finland were interviewed. The results support the suitability of usability engineering for map application design, since by including the usability approach into the product design, while simultaneously taking into account the individuality and diversity of users and their tasks together with the characteristics of the maps, application developers are more likely to design products that have a higher quality of use. This study identifies the main occasions when the usability approach could be most beneficial. Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of including usability approaches in map application design are discussed. Preliminary ideas on what usability means in the context of map applications are also given. Finally, the importance for providing a basis for the further development of application-specific guidelines and techniques is addressed.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly in the last decade and continues to develop in terms of dimension and complexity, offering a wide range of devices to support a diverse set of applications. With ubiquitous Internet, connected sensors and actuators, networking and communication technology along with artificial intelligence (AI), smart cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide services rendering assistance and convenience to humans in their daily lives. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic has exposed and highlighted the limitations of contemporary technological deployments especially to contain the widespread of this disease. IoT and smart connected technologies together with data-driven applications can play a crucial role not only in the prevention, mitigation, or continuous remote monitoring of patients, but also enable prompt enforcement of guidelines, rules, and administrative orders to contain such future outbreaks. In this paper, we envision an IoT and data-supported connected ecosystem designed for intelligent monitoring, pro-active prevention and control, and mitigation of COVID-19 and similar epidemics. We propose a gamut of synergistic applications and technology systems for various smart infrastructures including E-Health, smart home, supply chain management, transportation, and city, which will work in convergence to develop ‘pandemic-proof’ future smart communities. We also present a generalized cloud-enabled IoT implementation framework along with scientific solutions, which can be adapted and extended to deploy smart connected ecosystem scenarios using widely used Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructures. In addition, we also implement an E-Health RPM use case scenario to demonstrate the need and practicality for smart connected communities. Finally, we highlight challenges and research directions that need thoughtful consideration and across the board cooperation among stakeholders to build resilient communities against future pandemics.}

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a new technology which supports the creation and management of a construction project for buildings. The most well-known open BIM standard, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), provides the detailed 3D geometry and rich spatial semantics. It has drawn growing attention of researchers working in geographical information science (GIS). In many related applications, indoor navigation greatly benefits from IFC since it requires the information about building interiors. IFC provides the semantics and geometry of building, and topological relationships of building elements can be readily derived. These three types of information are extensively used in the research on indoor navigation. In this paper we review the current approaches, applications and solutions developed for different aspects of indoor navigation, and summarize the latest status about the use of IFC-based BIM for indoor navigation. In the literature regarding both IFC and indoor navigation, a total of 87 related papers are identified and categorized. 30 papers relate to the generation of indoor navigation models; 20 papers are about model conversion and data modeling on the basis of the IFC schema; 13 papers refer to IFC applications with dynamic environments; 14 papers focus on the support of IFC to indoor localization; and the other papers involve various topics such as visualization and network queries based on IFC. We find that the most active research direction is to generate navigation models from IFC data, yet there is no robust automation method of the generation. By discussing the pros and cons of the current applications, this paper suggests three new directions for further research on the IFC supports to indoor navigation. That is, researchers can further investigate the vertical dimension of the 3D geometry in IFC, facilitate the transformation from IFC to standardized indoor navigation models and manage real-time data with IFC to reflect indoor changes.}

The findings are based upon a corpus of data including: a field study at the offices of the largest travel user-generated website, TripAdvisor, and a netnographic approach. In particular we discuss the shift from Word-Of-Mouth to eWOM, the consequences for the sector and provide a balanced view of the role of reviews, ratings and lists.

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena.}

We anticipate changes in how we interact with our patients and other providers, how patient workflow is designed, the methods used to conduct our teaching sessions, and how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of the present report is to review some of the changes to consider in the clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow and, allow for a smoother transition, with less risk to our patients and healthcare personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and nonclinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for COVID-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and establishing the epidemiologic linkage will be crucial to containing and preventing new COVID-19 cases until a vaccine or an alternate solution is available. Additionally, the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs and personal protective equipment, the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, the increase in overhead costs, and the possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary, must be considered. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths will likely continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or the next 12 to 24 months. Thus, we must prioritize surgery, balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain COVID-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment, and ethical values to continue to deliver high-quality, economical, and accessible patient care.}

Furthermore, the deployment of UAVs in wireless networks as flying base stations (BSs), servers or relays is expected to enhance network performance in terms of coverage, capacity, reliability and energy-efficiency. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential applications and benefits of UAVs is presented. Specifically, UAVs as aerial BSs collecting data from ground sensors, transmitting power to energy-constrained devices and broadcasting information to ground users are explored along with representative design objectives. Then, UAVs as relay nodes for coverage extension, pathloss compensation and interference mitigation are surveyed comprehensively. Besides, UAVs as mobile servers performing edge computing for ground users are introduced, and various aerial offloading modes are reviewed thoroughly. Furthermore, radio and computation resource optimization, as well as mathematical tools and developed algorithms, are described in UAV-assisted communicating, relaying, and computing systems. Finally, open problems and potential research directions pertaining UAV-assisted communications are presented. In a nutshell, this tutorial provides key guidelines on how to design, analyze and optimize UAV-assisted wireless communication systems.}

abstract = {We are living through a convergence of crises. In 2020, when the ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic spread across the world, it brought economic instability in its wake. Sectors of the built environment (BE), among others, were hit hard by a public health crisis followed swiftly by an unprecedented economic downturn. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report highlighted the need for rapid and drastic action on climate change by 2030 to prevent the disastrous effects of a world warmed by more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, raising the urgency of achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by Member States in 2015. Even rapid decarbonisation, the report warned, would likely not be sufficient to address the intertwined problems of poverty, mass migration, politics and ecological collapse that the SDGs seek to address. Digital technology offers an opportunity to better understand and model solutions to these complex crises, but it is unclear how digital technology should be harnessed in the face of an uncertain future. Written at the beginning of this critical decade leading up to 2030, this paper looks ahead 20 years in the future to better understand the resources, technology, economy, governance, infrastructure, mobility and social factors that may shape the development of Britain’s digital BE. By exploring four scenarios around the variables of i) the UK’s compliance with the interconnected targets of the SDGs and ii) the size of the workforce relative to the dependent population (dependency), this paper concludes with the identification of key strategies that can lead to the sustainable development of the BE sectors, outlining a number of actions that should be combined with the path for recovery from Covid-19 and are based on digital technology and a green information economy that ensures a future better for everyone in a digital built Britain.}

This research proposes an information model to facilitate the data flow for post-earthquake assessment of reinforced concrete structures. The schema development was based on typical damage modes and the existing Industry Foundation Class (IFC) schema. Two examples of damaged structures from recent earthquake events, compiled using an experimental damage modeling software, illustrate the use of the data model. The model introduces two new classes, one to represent segments of building elements and the other to model the relationships between segments and cracks. A unique feature is the ability to model the process of damage with a binary tree structure. Methods for exporting as-damaged instance models using IFC are also discussed.}

abstract = {Several lifestyle choices made by contact lens wearers can have adverse consequences on ocular health. These include being non-adherent to contact lens care, sleeping in lenses, ill-advised purchasing options, not seeing an eyecare professional for regular aftercare visits, wearing lenses when feeling unwell, wearing lenses too soon after various forms of ophthalmic surgery, and wearing lenses when engaged in risky behaviors (e.g., when using tobacco, alcohol or recreational drugs). Those with a pre-existing compromised ocular surface may find that contact lens wear exacerbates ocular disease morbidity. Conversely, contact lenses may have various therapeutic benefits. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impinged upon the lifestyle of contact lens wearers, introducing challenges such as mask-associated dry eye, contact lens discomfort with increased use of digital devices, inadvertent exposure to hand sanitizers, and reduced use of lenses. Wearing contact lenses in challenging environments, such as in the presence of dust and noxious chemicals, or where there is the possibility of ocular trauma (e.g., sport or working with tools) can be problematic, although in some instances lenses can be protective. Contact lenses can be worn for sport, theatre, at high altitude, driving at night, in the military and in space, and special considerations are required when prescribing in such situations to ensure successful outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis, incorporated within the review, identified that the influence of lifestyle factors on soft contact lens dropout remains poorly understood, and is an area in need of further research. Overall, this report investigated lifestyle-related choices made by clinicians and contact lens wearers and discovered that when appropriate lifestyle choices are made, contact lens wear can enhance the quality of life of wearers.}

abstract = {Several manual-handling works (e.g. load-lifting, carrying, carpet-laying, etc.) involve repetitive lower limb movements (RLLM) such as squatting, kneeling, or walking which are notable risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the lower-limb and lumbar spine. Wearable exoskeletons can augment workers’ strength and minimize muscular activation in RLLM, thus enhancing efficiency and improving workers health. In this paper, we present the design and control of a wearable lower-body exoskeleton to assist RLLM. The design of the exoskeleton is anthropomorphic with six-degrees of freedom (6-DoF) on each leg: 1-active and 1-passive DoF on the hip-joint, 1-active and 1-passive DoF on the knee-joint, and 2-passive DoFs on the ankle-joint. The active DoFs are actuated by bi-directional brushless DC motors to permit sagittal movements. The exoskeleton controller is designed hierarchical with a low-level linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) torque controller, a middle-level user-input torque estimator based on dual extended Kalman filter (EKF), and a novel high-level supervisory algorithm for movement detection and synchronization of the exoskeleton with the user. Initial evaluation of the prototype is conducted on five healthy participants recruited to perform repetitive load-lifting and carrying manual-handling tasks. Electromyogram sensors are placed at the participants’ right Vastus Intermedius and right Gastrocnemius to extract muscle activity signals. Results show that the exoskeleton could provide torque assistance by amplifying participants’ input joint torques and could minimize muscular activation in the two muscles by more than 36% respectively in all movement tasks.}

In this paper, we explore the problems associated with both the optimising the operating point of any motion detection algorithms and the objective performance comparison of competing algorithms. In particular, we develop an object-based approach based on the F-Measure—a single-valued ROC-like measure which enables a straight-forward mechanism for both optimising and comparing motion detection algorithms. Despite the advantages over pixel-based ROC approaches, a number of important issues associated with parameterising the evaluation algorithm need to be addressed. The approach is illustrated by a comparison of three motion detection algorithms including the well-known Stauffer and Grimson algorithm, based on results obtained on two datasets.}

abstract = {While natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, and earthquakes are inevitable, improving existing emergency response approaches and technology becomes critical in today’s smart city development. That is, ensuring evacuees get a fast and effective evacuation route plays a very important role in increasing survival rate and reducing damage during emergency or disaster situations for smart cities. In this research, we investigate the design and development of efficient evacuation routes. By considering the realistic response to emergency evacuations, we present a model based on the number of incoming vehicles in different periods of time. In this paper, we propose a Queueing-based Recommendation system (Q-Recomm) for dynamic route recommendations for evacuees to use at the time of a disaster. Compared with other existing studies that use static conditions, our proposed algorithms consider dynamic road conditions by using queueing theory and graph theory. Specifically, we first characterize the evacuation network of a disaster as a directed acyclic graph and then exploit an MMPP/M/1/N queueing model to derive the optimal route in terms of the minimum driving time by analyzing road congestion, vehicle wait time, and road capacity as well as vehicle arrival rates for chosen routes, using high-end sensors for dynamic data acquisition. We propose the Queueing-based Time Constrained Route Recommendation (Q-TCRR) algorithm and the Queueing-based Minimum Driving Time Route Recommendation (Q-MDTRR) algorithm for route recommendation in evacuation networks. Our experimental results validate the accuracy of Q-TCRR and Q-MDTRR, respectively, and we also demonstrate that the Q-MDTRR algorithm has a lower driving time compared with both MacroServ and the shortest path route based on Dijkstra. Thus, while edge computing in vehicular ad hoc networks becomes a promising solution for evacuation networks, our two proposed algorithms can be flexibly realized in edge computing in vehicular ad hoc networks due to their computational efficiency.}

This confers a crucial role to comprehensive overviews capable of providing newcomers with the knowledge of the state of the art, as well as with the key physics and chemistry considerations needed to design MOFs for a specific application. In this review, we commit to this purpose by outlining the fundamental understanding needed to carefully navigate MOFs’ reticular diversity in their main fields of application, namely host–guest chemistry, chemical sensing, electronics, photophysics, and catalysis.

The question of blurring boundaries between the human and the technological aspects and the ways in which they alter the form of communication and action is tackled reflecting on the digital divide and socio-spatial inequalities. In order to connect theory and practice, implications from different cases are provided for shedding light on the expected impacts and scenarios for the changing patterns of mobility and accessibility. The results indicate hybridization of the on-site and online forms of mobilities, as well as new approaches to make culture and leisure more inclusive and accessible. Promoting local integration, emerging forms of local tourism such as staycations, using digital tools to foster co-creation, co-curation, and audience engagement, developing new models of business and consumption reflect the changing patterns of mobility and accessibility.

What is Russia's strategy for boosting development of AI technologies, and what role do groups within the Russian elite play in shaping this strategy? Russia's AI development strategy is unique in that it is led not by the government, nor by the private sector, but by state-owned firms. The government's distrust of Russia's largest tech firm, Yandex, has sidelined the company from national AI planning. Meanwhile, Russia's defense conglomerate Rostec publicly appears to focus less on artificial intelligence than on other high-tech priorities. As a result, Russia's AI development has been left to a state-owned bank, Sberbank, which has taken the lead in devising plans for government-backed investment in AI.}

Sustainability can be analyzed through four dimensions: the economic issue captured by productivity growth and export value growth, the social issue captured by employment growth, and the environmental issue captured by the sustainable nitrogen management index. Digital businesses are captured by four elements of e-Commerce (e-Commerce sales, e-Commerce web sales, e-Commerce turnover, and online selling) and two estimations of e-Business (Cloud usage and customer relation management (CRM) usage). Digital public services are reflected by user-centricity, business mobility, and key enablers. It is the first to prove the existence of a nonlinear relationship between digitalization and sustainable agriculture. We apply various econometric techniques, including the panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) model, feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimation, and two-step generalized method of moment (two-step GMM) model, to a database of 24 countries in the European Union between 2011 and 2019. The results point to the importance of digitalization in improving the agriculture sector's productivity, export activities, employment, and environmental sustainability. However, these impacts of digitalization on each dimension of the agriculture sector's sustainability are nonlinear in the shape of a U-curve, suggesting that the favorable effects only appear when the development of digitalization reaches a certain threshold. Our findings suggest critical policy implications for the promotion of digitalization as a tool to pursue smart and sustainable agriculture. It is crucial for policymakers to control the digitalization process and intervene, as digitalization, as much as it is innovative, can be detrimental to ethical, political, social, or cultural values.}

In general, ITS aims at ensuring better traffic efficiency and reducing road accidents. However, due to different limitations and issues, these systems suffer from different security and privacy vulnerabilities. In fact, they are both vulnerable to various types of security and privacy attacks that may result in life-endangering situations. As a result, several solutions were presented to achieve the required levels of security and confidentiality. In this paper, an overview of ITS is presented stating the reasons behind the evolution from Vanet to IoV. Then, the main threats/attacks that threaten ITS are classified according to their (1) security impact and according to the (2) network layer(s) they affect.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deemed a promising solution to settle the conflict between the resource-hungry mobile applications and the resource-constrained IoT users. On the other hand, in order to provide ubiquitous and reliable connectivity in wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be leveraged as efficient aerial platforms by exploiting their inherent attributes, such as the on-demand deployment, high cruising altitude, and controllable maneuverability in three-dimensional (3D) space. Thus, the UAV-enabled aerial MEC is believed as a win-win solution to facilitate cost-effective and energy-saving communication and computation services in various environments.

In this article, we present a brief planar overview of a smart city system architecture by introducing the application, sensing, communication, data, and security/privacy planes. Tailoring existing communication protocols and infrastructures to bridge massively deployed sensors and data processing/storage resources introduces unique communication challenges for smart cities. Furthermore, co-existence, integration, and control of dedicated and non-dedicated sensors is a grand challenge while IoT sensors continuously push sensory data through the communication medium towards data processing and analysis planes. While pervasiveness and ubiquity of smart city services are ensured by the interaction of communication and sensing technologies, their robustness and resilience call for customized security and privacy solutions. With these in mind, we focus on sensing/actuation, communication, and security planes of a smart city system and present a comprehensive survey of the challenges and state-of-the-art solutions in each plane. Furthermore, we provide insights for open issues and opportunities in these planes.}

In this study, we question this argument and provide empirical evidence by conducting a survey that links media channels’ affordances to their capability to carry organizations’ dialogic orientations. Results show that bandwidth and social presence affordances facilitate dialogic communication while anonymity slightly inhibits it, whether the communicative context is proactive or reactive. Social presence exerts the greatest impact on how publics perceive organizations’ dialogic orientations, and anonymity’s negative role was overstated by previous studies. Assessing media channels’ dialogic affordances, we found video conferencing and instant messaging to be the most dialogic channels for mediated organization-public communication.}

Taking an environmentally-imposed constraints point of view, we examine behaviors during each of three phases: reacting (e.g., hoarding and rejecting), coping (e.g. maintaining social connectedness, do-it-yourself behaviors, changing views of brands) and longer-term adapting (e.g. potentially transformative changes in consumption and individual and social identity). We discuss implications for marketing researchers and practice.}

In the military domain, there is also an increasing interest in utilising RAS technologies. In particular, ground-based forces are frequently called upon to conduct earthmoving tasks as part of military operations, tasks which could be partially or fully aided by the employment of RAS technologies. There have been rapid developments in military construction automation using high-mobility ground-based platforms, human-machine and machine-machine interfaces, teleoperation and control systems, data transmission systems, machine perception and manipulation capabilities, as well as advances in networked robotics and cyberphysical systems. Given these developments it is timely to undertake a comprehensive overview on the topic of interest to the research community and the authority. This paper presents an overview of the RAS development for platform-centric earthworks together with an analysis of the technical feasibility, maturity, key technical challenges, and future directions for the application of RAS technologies to earthmoving tasks of interest to the army.}

Consequently, the amount of data generated by devices at the edge of the network will also grow. While cloud computing has been an established and effective way of acquiring computation and storage as a service to many applications, it may not be suitable to handle the myriad of data from IoT devices and fulfill largely heterogeneous application requirements. Fog computing has been developed to lie between IoT and the cloud, providing a hierarchy of computing power that can collect, aggregate, and process data from/to IoT devices. Combining fog and cloud may reduce data transfers and communication bottlenecks to the cloud and also contribute to reduced latencies, as fog computing resources exist closer to the edge. This paper examines this IoT-Fog-Cloud ecosystem and provides a literature review from different facets of it: how it can be organized, how management is being addressed, and how applications can benefit from it. Lastly, we present challenging issues yet to be addressed in IoT-Fog-Cloud infrastructures.}

The industry and the academia are embracing 5G as the future network capable to support next generation vertical applications with different service requirements. To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.). Softwarization using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)in 5G networks are expected to fill the void of programmable control and management of network resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and updated solutions related to 5G network slicing using SDN and NFV. Firstly, we present 5G service quality and business requirements followed by a description of 5G network softwarization and slicing paradigms including essential concepts, history and different use cases. Secondly, we provide a tutorial of 5G network slicing technology enablers including SDN, NFV, MEC, cloud/Fog computing, network hypervisors, virtual machines & containers.

A comparison of various 5G architectural approaches in terms of practical implementations, technology adoptions and deployment strategies is presented. Moreover, we provide a discussion on various open source orchestrators and proof of concepts representing industrial contribution.

A number of different computational methods were trialed to detect spikes in tension using a human coded sample of data collected from Twitter, relating to an accusation of racial abuse during a Premier League football match. Conversation analysis combined with syntactic and lexicon-based text mining rules; sentiment analysis; and machine learning methods was tested as a possible approach. Results indicate that a combination of conversation analysis methods and text mining outperforms a number of machine learning approaches and a sentiment analysis tool at classifying tension levels in individual tweets.}

To provide a clearer picture of the empirical knowledge and modelling for evacuation studies, a generalized timeline is introduced. Recent behavioral evidence from empirical studies in the fields of both pedestrian evacuation and vehicular evacuations are reviewed to investigate the impact of various factors on the evacuee behavior over different phases. The consensus perspective on key behaviors that emerges is then used to review and consolidate the recent advances in evacuation modelling, in particular with respect to the formulations and techniques for representing these behaviors. Within each of these discussions, we pointed to current limitations and make corresponding suggestions on future research directions.}

For information systems (IS) the domain of semiosis consists of human and non-human interactions based on technologically-mediated communication in the social, material and personal worlds. The paper argues that semiosis has immense bearing on processes of communication central to the advanced information and communications technologies studied by IS scholars. Its use separately, or in mixed methods approaches, enriches areas of central concern to the IS field, and is particularly apt when researching internet-based development and applications, for example virtual worlds and social media. This paper presents a four step structured methodology, informed by a central theoretical semiotic framework to provide practical guidelines for operationalizing semiotics in IS research. Thus, using illustrative examples, the paper provides a step-by-step semiotics approach to research based on distinctive semiotic concepts and their relationships – producer, consumer, medium, code, message and content – and how, at an integrating level, the personal, social and material worlds relate through sociation, embodiment and socio-materiality.}

Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and MOOCs may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.}

In this context, marine robotics has steadily emerged as a key enabling technology for the execution of increasingly complex and challenging missions at sea. Intensive research and development in this field have led to major advances and shown unequivocally the effectiveness and reliability of marine robotics solutions in several domains. This progress goes hand in hand with the availability of increasingly sophisticated acoustic networks for multiple, cooperative missions involving surface and underwater robots. At the root of this trend is the fruitful dialogue between robotic systems developers and end-users with the capacity to convert general mission objectives into functional and technical specifications that serve as application-driven requirements for engineering development. The result is the tremendous progress observed in the consolidated methodologies and procedures adopted and the consequent impact on science, industry, and the society at large. In spite of the progress in the area, however many challenges must still be faced and novel applications will continue to set further requirements for future generations of marine robots and their enabling systems. The time is therefore appropriate to overview recent trends in the field of marine robotics and assess their impact on several important application domains. With these objectives in mind, in the present paper we highlight key technological achievements in the field, analyze some of the shortcomings encountered, and indicate specific issues that warrant further research and development effort. To this end, we review a number of highly representative projects in the field, with due account for the theoretical frameworks upon which technological developments build upon. Finally, the paper concludes with an outlook on the future of marine robotics, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, and describes recently initiated projects that hold promise for the development of advanced tools and systems for ocean exploration and exploitation.}

Descriptions, classifications, and comparative studies related to different UAV-assisted proposals are presented throughout the paper. By pointing out numerous future challenges, it is expected to simulate research in this emerging and hot research area. To the best of our knowledge, there are many survey papers on the topic from a technology perspective. Nevertheless, this survey can be considered as the first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of different types of existing UAV-assisted networks and describes the state-of-the-art in UAV-assisted research.}

abstract = {Fog computing has emerged as a promising technology that can bring cloud applications closer to the physical IoT devices at the network edge. While it is widely known what cloud computing is, how data centers can build the cloud infrastructure and how applications can make use of this infrastructure, there is no common picture on what fog computing and particularly a fog node, as its main building block, really is. One of the first attempts to define a fog node was made by Cisco, qualifying a fog computing system as a “mini-cloud” located at the edge of the network and implemented through a variety of edge devices, interconnected by a variety, mostly wireless, communication technologies. Thus, a fog node would be the infrastructure implementing the said mini-cloud. Other proposals have their own definition of what a fog node is, usually in relation to a specific edge device, a specific use case or an application. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art in technologies for fog computing nodes, paying special attention to the contributions that analyze the role edge devices play in the fog node definition. We summarize and compare the concepts, lessons learned from their implementation, and end up showing how a conceptual framework is emerging towards a unifying fog node definition. We focus on core functionalities of a fog node as well as in the accompanying opportunities and challenges towards their practical realization in the near future.}

These computing frameworks are the extensions of the basic cloud computing model and promise to offer improved network performance. The trio of these technologies forms a new domain called Edge–Fog–Cloud environment and is consistently being explored by researchers across the world. Numerous industrial applications use cloud resources and its services to avail the related benefits. Most of these industrial applications use a large number of power-sensitive devices that generate a huge volume of data. This data is termed as Industrial IoT (IIoT) data, and includes multi-dimensional information in its pool. This voluminous data pool need to be analyzed carefully to offer deep rooted insights that may help rejuvenate the system and boost its performance. This paper provides detailed coverage of the Edge–Fog–Cloud-based architectural frameworks, compares their pros and cons, and explores the scientific side of the multi-dimensional IIoT data.

Specifically, when we understand Google Earth as a virtual globe composed of surveyed panoramas, sober rationalization, dystopic control, and transparent order – or, even, as a tool for participation and empowerment – we undersell its capacities as an alluring digital peep-box, an uncertain orb spangled with vertiginous paranoia, frenzied navigation, jubilatory dissolution, and intoxicating giddiness. We argue that the former interpretations not only risk foreclosing our theorizations about how Google Earth is actually used in various ways and different contexts, they also reproduce a one-dimensional and conservative reading of technology that can be traced back (at least) to the writings of Theodor Adorno. By drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin (Adorno’s critic and pen pal for more than a decade) we aim to ‘go beyond Apollo and Adorno’ by illustrating the extent to which Apollonian order and Dionysian love makes Google Earth go round. To do this, we examine Google Earth as a “digital peep-box” with an online collective that revels in its “Spot the Black Helicopter” competitions; illuminated profanities; alien and giant insect invaders; naked sunbathers; and crashed transport planes in Darfur.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) allows communication between devices, things, and any digital assets that send and receive data over a network without requiring interaction with a human. The main characteristic of IoT is the enormous quantity of data created by end-user’s devices that needs to be processed in a short time in the cloud. The current cloud-computing concept is not efficient to analyze very large data in a very short time and satisfy the users’ requirements. Analyzing the enormous quantity of data by the cloud will take a lot of time, which affects the quality of service (QoS) and negatively influences the IoT applications and the overall network performance. To overcome such challenges, a new architecture called edge computing — that allows to decentralize the process of data from the cloud to the network edge has been proposed to solve the problems occurred by using the cloud computing approach. Furthermore, edge computing supports IoT applications that require a short response time and consequently enhances the consumption of energy, resource utilization, etc. Motivated by the extensive research efforts in the edge computing and IoT applications, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of edge and fog computing research in the IoT. We investigate the role of cloud, fog, and edge computing in the IoT environment. Subsequently, we cover in detail, different IoT use cases with edge and fog computing, the task scheduling in edge computing, the merger of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) with edge computing, security and privacy efforts. Furthermore, the Blockchain in edge computing. Finally, we identify open research challenges and highlight future research directions.}

In order to address this issue, and to increase the accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the health-care domain, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) was proposed. IoMT can be considered as an enhancement and investment to respond more effectively and efficiently to patients’ needs. However, IoMT suffers from different issues and challenges such as the lack of security and privacy measures, in addition to the necessary training and awareness. In this paper, we highlight the importance of implementing the right security measures and the required training skills, in order to enhance the immunity of IoMT against cyber-attacks. Moreover, we review the main IoMT security and privacy issues, and the existing security solutions. These solutions are classified as cryptographic or non-cryptographic. Then, the different solutions are analyzed and compared in terms of computational complexity and required resources. It is important to note that the security measures for IoMT exhibit a trade-off between the security level and the system performance, especially in the rise of digital healthcare v4.0 era. Next, we discuss the appropriate security solutions such as lightweight cryptographic algorithms, and protocols that attempt to reduce the overhead in terms of computations and resources. This leads to the conclusion that there is a need to design an efficient intrusion detection/prevention system that cooperates with dynamic shadow honeypots. Finally, we propose a security solution, which is divided into five different layers to detect and prevent attacks, in addition to reducing/correcting the damage of these known attacks and preserving the patients’ privacy. However, it should be noted that zero-day attacks and exploits are still the main challenging issue that surrounds IoMT.}

Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.}

abstract = {Humans more and more live in urban areas and spend the majority of their time indoors, while buildings are becoming increasingly interconnected. Path planning in complex indoor environments is consequently becoming a societal challenge. This paper proposes a system, called BiMov, dedicated to automatically determining plan paths in complex buildings based on a digital mock-up (a BIM in IFC format). The originality of the research comes from the separation of the BIM model topological analysis from the semantic and geometric consideration of the customer of the path planning service. The process consists in exploiting the semantic, geometric, and topological features of the constituents of a BIM to generate navigation graphs that take the profile of MOoP (Mobile Object or Person) and the operational accessibility status of spaces and transitions (such as doors or stairs) into account. The ultimate aim is to determine the optimal path according to given criteria. The system is based on four data models: (1) a building model derived from the original BIM that represents and structures the building features relevant to indoor mobility; (2) a MOoP model representing its bulk size, ability to move horizontally and vertically, and various authorisations; (3) a calendar model representing the conjectural accessibility status of spaces and transitions; (4) a navigation graph model proposing three levels of detail. The Macro level represents a simple graph of connectivity between neighbouring interior spaces and is intended to help architects verify their design in terms of accessibility. The External level is used to connect accessible spaces via their common horizontal or vertical transitions. This level is intended for MOoPs that do not require a detailed description of the path. The Internal level integrates meshing of each space: a 2D mesh for planar mobility or a 3D mesh for drones. This level is intended for MOoP such as heavy object handlers or autonomous mobile vehicles that need to validate a reliable path within spaces containing furniture, hazardous machinery, or bulky equipment. We developed a prototype software application that illustrates our approach for different path planning scenarios in a BIM model generated outside this project.}

Therefore, assessment of naval platform recoverability, after a damage event, is critical to assure platform survivability in a warfighting environment. To support such an assessment, an innovative modelling and simulation capability, known as the Naval Damage Incident Recoverability Toolset (NavDIRecT) is being developed. NavDIRecT is being designed as a component-based, open architecture providing the necessary framework to allow analysts to integrate domain models of their choosing. NavDIRecT will facilitate analysis of warfighting and peacetime damage events using a variety of mathematical models, thereby avoiding the limitations of other survivability assessment techniques. Development of NavDIRecT is exemplified by integrating the human movement simulator, maritimeEXODUS, the fire simulation environment, SMARTFIRE, and a three-dimensional naval platform model. NavDIRecT will enable analysis of crew interaction with damage events, thereby allowing acquisition programs and mission planners to examine platform survivability with respect to mission capability requirements. The impetus for NavDIRecT development is for assessment of naval platform survivability and mission success; however, the tools and techniques are equally suitable for use in incident management, training, and analysis of merchant and commercial shipping in accordance with the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).}

By 2030, a 50% rise in lighting demand of the existing consumption is projected due to an increase in the global population. To address the concern of rising lighting electricity consumption, the key strategy is to develop and provide energy efficient lighting products to consumers. In this respect, the Solid-State Lighting (SSL) has the potential to offer power efficiencies that are superior to those of conventional lighting sources. Recently, white organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have emerged as the leading technology for the new display and lighting market which has attracted substantial attention of manufacturers, product designers, and end users. OLED devices have already entered into high end lighting markets such as designer, automotive, aerospace, high-end architectural lighting, and other applications. Moreover, innovative flexible OLED devices are thought to be candidates for the next-generation SSL systems, wearable electronics, mobile devices, microdisplays, etc. as they are lighter, thinner and more durable compared to glass (rigid) based devices. In the present review, distinctive features of OLEDs SSL lighting, technical requirements of lighting for applications, OLED basic, and classification of OLED devices, including quantum dot (QD) OLEDs (QLED) as well as the need of development of OLEDs standards are discussed. Various constituents of flexible OLED lighting, OLED lighting panels by some manufacturers, hurdles in OLED lighting technologies, performance of OLEDs in harsh conditions, challenges in flexible OLEDs, OLED lighting technology comparison, OLED lighting roadmap, and future directions including cost reduction analysis, flexible OLED incorporated into automotive, IoT (Internet of Things) connected lighting system, OLED market projections, etc. are also presented. It is suggested that the white OLEDs, and flexible OLEDs in particular, lighting products have potential to revolutionize the future of lighting systems, industries, and the market.}

Since the development of such policies is challenging, there is a need to learn from the experience of many cities around the world offering efficient and successfully adopted smart mobility services. However, in practice, the information provided about such initiatives is shallow and unstructured. To address this issue, we study the state of the art in mobility services, reviewing scientific publications and 42 smart mobility services delivered by nine smart cities around the world, and we propose a taxonomy for planning and designing smart mobility services. The taxonomy provides a common vocabulary to discuss and share information about such services. It comprises eight dimensions: type of services, maturity level, users, applied technologies, delivery channels, benefits, beneficiaries, and common functionality. The contribution of the proposed taxonomy is to serve as a tool for guiding policy makers by identifying a spectrum of mobility services that can be provided, to whom, what technologies can be used to deliver them, and what is the delivered public value so to justify their implementation. In addition, the taxonomy can also assist researchers in further developing the domain. By identifying common functionality, it could also help Information Technology (IT) teams in building and maintaining smart mobility services. Finally, we further discuss usage scenarios of the taxonomy by policy makers, IT staff and researchers.}

We point out four distinct channels through which Internet can shape well-being: it changes time use patterns, creates new activities, facilitates access to information, and acts as powerful communication tool. We show how these four channels impact well-being in distinct domains of life. A central point emerging from the literature review is that the effects of Internet on well-being are mediated by a set of personal characteristics that are specific to each individual: psychological functioning, capabilities, and framing conditions (culture and beliefs). Hence, it is the interaction between human beings’ activities in distinct domains of life and their own personal characteristics that explains why the use of Internet has stronger positive effects for some individuals and social groups than others.}

Drawing on theories of gratifications, task-technology fit, and media dependency, we develop an integrative research model to understand Gen Yers’ mobile social media use intention in emergencies. Based on survey data from 424 Gen Y users in China, we conduct a structural equation modeling analysis and an artificial neural network analysis to validate the model. On one hand, social media dependency has a significant and positive effect on gratifications users seek during emergencies. Each gratification positively influences use intention except for information sharing. In order of the effects on use intention, communication is the most important, followed by solitary play and information seeking. On the other hand, both perceived mobility and task features positively influence perceived task-technology fit, which in turn exerts a significant effect on mobile social media use intention. The findings provide a fine-grained understanding of the relative importance of key predictors of mobile social media use intention in emergencies. Moreover, these findings, however limited to China’s Gen Y, suggest a role of solitary play and raise possible concern regarding an absence of information sharing.}

In fact, during the crisis numerous digital redesigns of businesses occurred to pursue both continuity and competitive advantage. Among these, the food retail sector has undergone under the pressure of the crisis intense digital changes, which, however, have not yet been investigated under the theoretical lens of BMI. To fill this gap, the paper analyzes the digital actions taken during the pandemic crisis by two large food retailers, namely Walmart and Carrefour. Covering a wide temporal interval of the pandemic evolution and reviewing multiple geographical markets, the authors interpreted the grocer's digital responses to the crisis in terms of innovation in value creation and capture mechanisms. As a result, three phases of digital BMI have been reconstructed, each characterized by specific mechanisms of value creation and capture experienced by the two grocers during the pandemic. Leveraging these findings, the paper proposes a model capable of defining how digital BMI takes place in response to crises. Results broaden theoretical knowledge and practical suggestions on digital BMI in terms of enabling factors, actionable value mechanisms, and future business opportunities.}

Frequent overloading of the operator’s visual channel may result in accidents. To reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve overall operating performance, this paper proposes the extension of the HMI to the hearing modality. The proposed HMI takes the form of a spatial auditory display for complex navigation tasks such as path following (route guidance) or trajectory tracking. The interface incorporates two novel components. The first is the application of a modified “lookahead distance” guidance strategy, as a guidance law for generating a reference. The reference is presented to the operator as a spatial auditory image of the virtual target to be followed. Before being presented to the operator, the reference information is preconditioned through “supernormal” transformations to increase azimuth and distance resolution in regions of interest and thus to improve efficiency and overcome the comparative disadvantages of the hearing channel. A series of experiments show that the proposed guidance strategy provides a comprehensible and effective auditory reference. The enhanced supernormal auditory interface improves performance by reducing the tracking error of both path following and trajectory tracking compared to a non-enhanced interface without the supernormal transformation. Experiment participants report that the novel auditory interface is intuitive and easy to use, providing very good situational awareness. While the auditory interface investigated in this paper is shown to be effective for the teleoperation of unmanned vehicles, it may have other applications such as navigation for the visually impaired.}

After a disaster, communication failures are one of the essential causes of sufferers. To deal with this problem, offering “connectivity from the sky” is a novel and creative development. Aerial communications have been examined through the assessment and the design of the stratospheric platform capable of providing numerous types of wireless services. Drones, low and high-altitude platforms, airships, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are regarded as applicants for organizing aerial communications supplementing the infrastructure of global interaction. Aerial communication devices are vulnerable to being physically hijacked, destroyed, or lost. Therefore, security is a crucial issue in aerial communication networks. The blockchain technology is a potential solution candidate to tackle this issue. Blockchain is a decentralized and disseminated ledger, guards the distributed information using methods of cryptography, for example, public-key encryption and hash functions. It can use for guaranteeing the reliability of the data stored and for enhancing the transparency and security of aerial communication networks. This paper presents a survey on the integration of Blockchain with Aerial Communications (BAC). First, we study aerial communication networks and their current security issues, blockchain and its advantages, the feasibility and opportunity of applying the blockchain to resolve the current security issue in aerial communication networks. Next, we discuss current related solutions for applying the blockchain to resolve the current security issue in aerial communication networks in detail. We classify the solutions, compare and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we recommend some research directions for future investigations.}

abstract = {Uncertainties and risks play a central role in creating vulnerabilities for logistics service operations. Over the years, Logistic Service Providers (LSPs) have learned how to ensure resilience to confront uncertainties and risks triggered by adverse events. However, quite unlike any seen in recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic brings about unavoidable uncertainties and risks for the logistics industry. Yet, there is no common approach to contextualize how they interact together. We incorporate an empirical research design and make a threefold contribution: first, we identify uncertainties and risks that LSPs encounter during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate their prominence. Second, we unveil intertwined schemes of afore-identified uncertainties and risks and augment the understanding of their cause-effect structure. Third, we provide an uncertainty and risk assessment guideline for LSPs affected by threats emerging from unforeseeable crises. In this study, we combine qualitative work and the fuzzy DEMATEL method. Qualitative thematic analysis of in-depth interviews reveals the most important uncertainties (COVID-19 measures, employee welfare, forecast horizon, demand change, and government regulations) and risks (COVID-19 risk, delivery delays, supply chain disruptions, financial failure, and product returns) for LSPs. The fuzzy DEMATEL method shows that COVID-19 measures and COVID-19 risk are highly prominent and influence other factors. The results indicate that demand change, government regulations, and supply chain disruptions are net causers, and employee welfare, financial failure, forecast horizon, delivery delays, and product returns are net receivers. Distinctly, employee welfare is the most affected factor, empirically confirming that major risks for LSPs are related to the human factor. More investigation in our results suggests that supply chain disruptions and demand change, two factors triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, influence financial failure and forecast horizon, two factors associated with operational performance.}

Numerous emerging computing paradigms related to those areas of research and/or their intersections have come into play.

Geospatial Scientists aim to help in mitigating or managing such hazards by computational modeling of these complex events, while Information Communication Technology (ICT) supports the execution of various models addressing different aspects of disaster management. The execution of natural hazard models using traditional ICT foundations is not possible in a timely manner due to the complex nature of the models, the need for large-scale computational resources as well as intensive data and concurrent-access requirements. Cloud Computing can address these challenges with near-unlimited capacity for computation, storage, and networking, and the ability, to offer natural hazard modeling systems as end services, has now become more realistic than ever. However, researchers face several open challenges in adopting and utilizing Cloud Computing technologies during disasters. As such, this survey paper aggregates all these challenges, reflects on the current research trends and outlines a conceptual Cloud-based solution framework for more effective natural hazards modeling and management systems using Cloud infrastructure in conjunction with other technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks, fog, and edge computing.

This study investigates one particular affordance of VR, namely environmental embeddedness, which enables learners to be situated in simulated or imagined settings that contextualize their learning. A sample of 51 university students were administered written learning material in a between-subjects design study, wherein one group read text about sarcoma cancer on a physical pamphlet in the real world, and the other group read identical text on a virtual pamphlet embedded in an immersive VR environment which resembled a hospital room. The study combined advanced EEG measurement techniques, learning tests, and cognitive load measures to compare conditions. Results show that the VR group performed significantly better on a knowledge transfer post-test. However, reading in VR was found to be more cognitively effortful and less time-efficient. Findings suggest the significance of environmental embeddedness for learning, and provide important considerations for the design of educational VR environments, as we remediate learning content from non-immersive to immersive media.}
