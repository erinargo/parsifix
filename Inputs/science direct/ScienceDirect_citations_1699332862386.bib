abstract = {Over the past few years, transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, commonly referred to as MXenes have been discovered and utilized quickly in a range of technical fields due to their distinctive and controlled characteristics. MXenes are a new class of two-dimensional (2D) materials that have found extensive use in a variety of fields, including energy storage, catalysis, sensing, biology, and other scientific disciplines. This is because of their exceptional mechanical and structural characteristics, metal electrical conductivity, and other outstanding physical and chemical properties. In this contribution, we review recent cellulose research advances and show that MXene hybrids are effective composites that benefit from cellulose superior water dispersibility and the electrostatic attraction between cellulose and MXene to prevent MXene accumulation and improve the composite's mechanical properties. Electrical, materials, chemical, mechanical, environmental, and biomedical engineering are all fields in which cellulose/MXene composites are used. These properties and applications-based reviews on MXene/cellulose composite, critically analyze the results and accomplishments in these fields and provide context for potential future research initiatives. It examines newly reported applications for cellulose nanocomposites assisted by MXene. To support their development and future applications, perspectives and difficulties are suggested in the conclusion.}

abstract = {Commotio cordis is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by sudden cardiac arrest resulting from a blunt chest impact. While commotio cordis has traditionally been associated with sports-related activities, a significant proportion of cases occur in non-sport-related settings, such as assaults, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), and daily activities. This critical review examines the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, highlighting the need for increased awareness and improved management in these contexts. The review analyzes existing literature, drawing attention to the demographics of non-sports-related cases, which predominantly affect adolescents and young adults, with males being the primary demographic. In contrast to sport-related cases, non-sports-related commotio cordis cases exhibit a wider age range and a higher proportion of female subjects. Mortality rates are significantly higher in non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, largely due to lower rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), limited access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), and delayed initiation of resuscitative efforts compared to sport-related incidents. This underscores the critical importance of increasing awareness and preparedness in non-sport-related settings. To mitigate the risks associated with non-sports-related commotio cordis, efforts should focus on early recognition of the condition, timely administration of CPR, and the widespread availability and accessibility of AEDs in various environments. Enhanced awareness and education can potentially lead to a reduction in mortality and improved outcomes for individuals affected by commotio cordis outside of sports-related activities. In conclusion, commotio cordis is not exclusive to sports and presents a significant health risk in non-sport-related scenarios. This review emphasizes the urgent need for increased awareness, preparedness, and resuscitation measures in non-sports contexts to address the higher mortality associated with these cases.}

abstract = {Aim of the review
Use of smart devices to provide real-time cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) feedback in the context of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has considerable potential for improving survival. However, the findings of previous studies evaluating the effectiveness of these devices have been conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the utility of smart devices for improving the quality of CPR during CPR training.
Data sources
Thirteen electronic databases were searched. The articles were reviewed according to the eligibility criteria. CPR quality was evaluated based on the rates and depths of chest compression, and the proportion of adequate depth of chest compressions.
Results
Ultimately, 11 studies (5 randomised controlled trials, 1 randomised trial, and 5 randomised cross-over trials) were selected for this systematic review. Eight of these studies used smartphones and three used smartwatches. This review did not find an apparent benefit from smart device use during CPR in terms of maintaining the recommended compression rates and depths of chest compressions. However, all three smartwatch studies reported that the proportion of chest compressions of adequate depth was significantly improved with smartwatch use (smartwatch group vs. non-smartwatch group in the three studies: 65.01% vs. 45.15%, p = 0.01; 64.6% vs. 43.1%, p = 0.049; 98.7% vs. 79.3%, p = 0.002).
Conclusion
This review does not find durable evidence for usefulness of smart devices in CPR training. However, the smartwatches may improve the accuracy of chest compression depth. Future studies with larger sample sizes might be necessary before reaching a firm conclusion.}

The use of a Health Monitoring System could aid the cabin crew in early detecting critical health conditions. Additionally, for passengers there is no possibility to discreetly inform the crew about emergencies since there is only a Passenger Call Button available. Research Question This paper analyses passengers´ user acceptance of the Health Monitoring System as well as the Emergency Button. Method Participants needed to complete an online survey and were presented prototypes of the Health Monitoring System as well as the Emergency Button. User acceptance was measured using the Van der Laan scale. A total of 41 participants contributed to the study. Result The user ratings for the Onboard Health Monitoring System were low mainly due to privacy concerns of the passengers. Since only one use case for the Emergency Button has been presented to the participants of the study, the user acceptance ratings were also low. Discussion Passengers were reluctant to share sensitive data. However, the majority (over 70%, n≥ 11, effective sample size=16)) agreed to have the most important vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, oxygen saturation measured. Conclusion To increase user acceptance of the Health Monitoring System it is important for the passengers to ensure that sensitive data is handled and stored carefully. Additional detailed usability assessments would be necessary for both devices to draw further conclusions about system design.}

Conceptual advances in the study of tourist videography have produced a new model of these practices which is applied here to explain the nature of tourist videography with drones. An international sample of 351 vacation drone videos was subjected to content analysis, and an analysis of their metadata. The results show a significant variation in the content, technological and social practice of production of vacation drone videos depending on the type of video creator and, therefore, empirically validate and expand extant knowledge of drone videography as an emerging visual practice in tourism contexts. The findings establish that analysing the videos from the perspective of videography generates insights that are of value to destination management organizations and tourist businesses. We conclude that destination management organizations should see vacation drone videos as a new type of user-generated content for their destinations, as well as a potential source of innovative marketing ideas, and that they should engage more proactively with vacation drone videographers to maximise the impact of this opportunity.}

With an average of more than 6.5 devices per person, a plethora of applications are being developed especially related to healthcare. Although, current edge devices such as smartphone and smartwatch are becoming increasingly more powerful and more affordable, there are certain tasks such as those involving machine learning that require higher computational resources, thereby resulting in higher energy consumption in the case of edge devices. Offloading tasks to co-located edge nodes such as fog (a cloud-like localized, smaller resource pool), or a femto-cloud (integration of multiple edge nodes) is one viable solution to address the issues such as performing compute-intensive tasks, and managing energy consumption. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and becoming a pandemic has also made a case for edge computing (involving smartphone, wearables, health sensors) for the detection of symptoms to quarantine potential carriers of the virus. We focus on how various forms of smart and opportunistic healthcare (oHealth) can be provided by leveraging edge computing that makes use of a machine learning-based approach. We apply k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector classification (SVC) algorithms on real data trace for the healthcare and safety-related scenarios we considered. The empirical results obtained provide useful insights into machine learning-based task offloading in edge computing.}

Although the capabilities of healthcare and public health systems have increased with a dramatic boost in the use of the Internet of Things (IoT), such IoT-enabled systems are often operating in silos. A pressing need, thus, is the seamless integration of those currently incompatible systems. A promising solution is to leverage semantic technologies to increase interoperability among such systems. Therefore, this article aims to: conduct a systematic review on the current state-of-the-art semantic IoT solutions used in health domain; identify the associated challenges; propose a federated edge-cloud semantic IoT architecture to facilitate the healthcare and public health (HC-PH) collaborations for the health and well-being of the individuals and populations.}

In order to overcome this limitation, solutions emerged, such as smart homes and wearable devices. Smart homes integrate sensors, actuators, and artificial intelligence to assist seniors in their everyday life. One of the objectives is to recognize the activities of everyday life. This recognition aims to provide the right assistance at the right moment and gives some autonomy to seniors. However, it is a complex task (a significant quantity of different sensors, hardware implementation), and the number of solutions (combinations between approaches, for example, video-based HAR and wearable sensors-based HAR) that exist is important. In this paper, we propose to perform the activity recognition from three ultra-wideband (UWB) radars, deep learning models, and a voting system. Also, all the experiments have been conducted in a real apartment and are composed of 15 different activities. The presented solution is simple compared to the literature since we exploit only one type of sensor. Finally, we obtained promising results with our approach. Indeed, the classification rate reaches 90% and more in some cases.}

This knowledge can reflect individuals’ future health, which leads to their information advantage. People with information advantages can hide their true private information and obtain insurance, which leads to service inefficiency for insurance providers. To reduce this inefficiency, we design a mechanism for the health system to build a set of multi-strategy combination insurance plans for heterogeneous probabilistic individuals, where the prices and the price difference of plans guide their choice and prevention strategy. First, after analysing the utility of the individuals and the health system when the individuals use true/false information, we propose a reasonable goal of this mechanism: When the people use true information to make decisions, the individuals and the health system can obtain maximum utility. Second, we provide the conditions for the individuals and the health system to participate in health insurance, and the conditions for achieving the rationality goal of the mechanism. Finally, we obtain the optimal result for the individuals and the health system. On one hand, some new theories on mechanism design are produced in health insurance transactions. On the other hand, the insurance scheme design effectively eliminates the individual’s motive for concealing information and improves the efficiency of health services.}

With the increase in the uptake of Internet-of-Things home devices, it becomes critical to understand the digital harms of smart homes. We present a systematic literature review on the security and privacy harms of smart homes. PRISMA methodology is used to systematically review 63 studies published between January 2011 and October 2021; and a review of known cases is undertaken to illustrate the literature review findings with real-world scenarios. Published literature identifies that smart homes may pose threats to confidentiality (unwanted release of information), authentication (sensing information being falsified) and unauthorised access to system controls. Most existing studies focus on privacy intrusions as a prevalent form of harm against smart homes. Other types of harms that are less common in the literature include hacking, malware and DoS attacks. Digital harms, and data associated with these harms, may vary extensively across smart devices. Most studies propose technical measures to mitigate digital harms, while fewer consider social prevention mechanisms. We also identify salient gaps in research, and argue that these should be addressed in future crossdisciplinary research initiatives.}

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increase in human life expectancy fueled by significant improvements in infrastructure, healthcare, and economies across the globe. Longer life spans have altered the world demographics resulting in a larger senior population compared with previous years. This trend has created the need for providing additional care and assistive services to support the aging individuals. Innovative assistance techniques are especially necessary for elderly people who live on their own in their homes. Simultaneously, an explosive growth in IoT gadgets such as sensors and actuators have accelerated the development of smart homes which comprise various types of IoT systems that provide increased convenience to people with degenerating physical and cognitive abilities. Common examples of IoT systems that are being integrated into smart homes include home automation systems, home activity detectors, wearable sensor technologies for remote health management and so on. We identify the common needs of aging and impaired individuals and then we review several IoT applications that can provide the required support. We further discuss some of the challenges that must be addressed to make these IoT systems more practical and reliable for everyday use.}

abstract = {Introduction
We developed and validated an abbreviated Digital Sleep Questionnaire (DSQ) to identify common societal sleep disturbances including insomnia, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS), and risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
Methods
The DSQ was administered to 3799 community volunteers, of which 2113 were eligible and consented to the study. Of those, 247 were interviewed by expert sleep physicians, who diagnosed ≤2 sleep disorders. Machine Learning (ML) trained and validated separate models for each diagnosis. Regularized linear models generated 15–200 features to optimize diagnostic prediction. Models were trained with five-fold cross-validation (repeated five times), followed by robust validation testing. ElasticNet models were used to classify true positives and negatives; bootstrapping optimized probability thresholds to generate sensitivities, specificities, accuracies, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).
Results
Compared to reference subgroups, physician-diagnosed sleep disorders were marked by DSQ evidence of sleeplessness (insomnia, DSPS, OSA), sleep debt (DSPS, ISS), airway obstruction during sleep (OSA), blunted circadian variability in alertness (DSPS), sleepiness (DSPS and ISS), increased alertness (insomnia) and global impairment in sleep-related quality of life (all sleep disorders). ElasticNet models validated each diagnosis with high sensitivity (80–83%), acceptable specificity (63–69%), high AUC (0.80–0.85) and good accuracy (agreement with physician diagnoses, 68–73%).
Discussion
A brief DSQ readily engaged and efficiently screened a large population for common sleep disorders. Powered by ML, the DSQ can accurately classify sleep disturbances, demonstrating the potential for improving the sleep, health, productivity and safety of populations.}

The performance of the printed graphene e-textile wearable systems were benchmarked against the “gold standard” silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) “wet” electrodes; achieving excellent correlation up to ∼ 96% and ∼ 98% in ECG recordings (15 s duration) acquired with graphene textiles fabricated by dip-coating and spray printing techniques, respectively. In addition, we successfully implemented automatic detection of heartrate of 8 volunteers (mean value: 74.4 bpm) during 5 min of static and dynamic daily activities and benchmarked their recordings with a standard fingertip photoplethysmography (PPG) device. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated, and the root means successive square difference (rMMSD) metric was 30 ms during 5 min of recording. Other cardiac parameters such as R-R interval, QRS complex duration, S-T segment duration, and T-wave duration were also detected and compared to typical chest ECG values.}

Our goals are to (1) evaluate input modalities for the drones, derived from an iterative narrowing of the design space, (2) improve our mixed reality system for designing input modalities and training operators, and (3) collect data on how participants socially experience the virtual drones with which they work. In our study, 17 participants played the game with two input modalities (Gesture condition, Tap condition) in counterbalanced order. Results indicated that participants performed best with the Gesture condition. Participants found the multiple controls challenging, and future studies might include more training of the devices and game. Participants felt like a team with the drones and found them moderately agentic. In our future work, we will extend this testing to a more externally valid mixed reality game.}

Despite substantial research worldwide, very few AI-based applications have successfully made it to clinics. Key barriers to the widespread adoption of clinically validated AI applications include non-standardized medical records, limited availability of curated datasets, and stringent legal/ethical requirements to preserve patients’ privacy. Therefore, there is a pressing need to improvise new data-sharing methods in the age of AI that preserve patient privacy while developing AI-based healthcare applications. In the literature, significant attention has been devoted to developing privacy-preserving techniques and overcoming the issues hampering AI adoption in an actual clinical environment. To this end, this study summarizes the state-of-the-art approaches for preserving privacy in AI-based healthcare applications. Prominent privacy-preserving techniques such as Federated Learning and Hybrid Techniques are elaborated along with potential privacy attacks, security challenges, and future directions.}

Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

A fully spray coated photovoltaic (PV) device fabricated on fabric has been successfully demonstrated with comparable power conversion efficiency to glass based counterparts. All the PV devices are characterised under AM 1.5 (100mW/cm2) irradiation using an ABET solar simulator. Device morphologies are examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The aim of this study is to develop and optimise a method to obtain reproducible photovoltaic textiles using a fully spray coating processing at low temperature (<150 °C) on a standard 65/35 polyester cotton fabric. The main challenge when spray coating solar cells of less than a few micron thickness is the surface roughness of the polyester cotton fabric which is of the order of 150 µm. We report a maximum optimised efficiency of 2.7% achieved on a glass substrate and 0.02% on woven fabrics, respectively. This approach is suitable for the low cost integration of PV devices into clothing and other decorative textiles.}

Oxide ceramic micro-nanofibers (MNFs) belong to a new structural ceramic system, but they suffer from intrinsic hardness and brittleness. We have been committed to developing new textile technologies and fabricating flexible oxide ceramic MNFs. In this review, the development status of oxide ceramic MNFs and their applications are first briefly summarized. Then, the definition of flexibility and flexibility mechanisms of MNFs, as well as the strategies and methods for fabricating flexible oxide ceramic MNFs are comprehensively discussed. Finally, our perspective on the future development of oxide ceramic MNFs is proposed. We suppose that they will develop toward the direction of flexibility, porosity, multifunctionality, thin film, and aerogels, and their functional applications will permeate from the traditional heat insulation to the emerging fields such as flexible electronics and batteries, intelligent artificial muscle, and industrial catalysis.}

The thermal transfer between individual body and the surroundings occurs by several paths such as radiation, evaporation, conduction, and convection. Thermal management is related with the heat transfer between the human body and the surroundings, which aims to keep the body temperature in the comfort range either via preserving or via emitting the body heat. The essential duty of clothing is to contribute to the thermal balance of the human body by regulating the heat and moisture transfer. In the case of poorly controlled body heat, health problems such as hyperthermia and heatstroke along with environmental problems due to higher energy consumption can occur. Recently, research has been focused on advanced textiles with novel approaches on materials synthesis and structure design, which can provide thermal comfort together with energy saving. This review article focuses on the innovative strategies basically on the passive textile models for improved thermal conductivity. We will discuss both the fabrication techniques and the inclusion of carbon-based and boron-based fillers to form nano-hybrid textile solutions, which are used to improve the thermal conductivity of the materials.}

abstract = {Prior to widespread sensor deployments being used to create networks for applications like fuel-based home appliances, industrial emissions, and vehicle emissions, it is crucial to find a solution to the issue of gas sensor selectivity. Equally important is the ability to detect low ppm concentrations of gases. Two-dimensional materials, also known as 2D materials, are superior candidates for high performance gas detection because of dramatic changes in resistivity upon molecular adsorption, high surface-to-volume ratio, tunable electronic properties, and high surface activities. In this review article, we give a brief introduction to the fascinating applications for various toxic gas sensing applications with a wide range of architectural designs. In this category are devices known as field effect transistors (FETs), which are based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), integration of TMDs with reduced graphene (TMDs/rGr), TMDs heterostructures (2D/2D), TMDs/metal interfaces, double heterostructures (2D/2D/2D), TMDs doped with metal–organic framework (MOF), and TMDs/MXene heterostructures. Due to the intriguing characteristics at the junction interface, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of 2D materials have a great deal of potential for electronic devices. The high-performance and low-power gas sensors that are essential in the Internet of Things (IoT) era and that significantly raise the standard of living the world over are constructed using the promising methods based on 2D materials in this overview. Finally, it concludes by summarizing the opportunities and challenges that are currently present.}

We select and analyze 40 mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems for which prototypes were deployed and studied in the real world. Inspired by the MIT's genetic model of collective intelligence, we propose our genetic model and new genes for mobile and situated crowdsourcing systems by examining user contributions to the selected systems. We present the observed patterns of different genes and discuss how the model can be used to create new applications and design ideas. By reviewing the existing design principles of online communities, we also provide examples to illustrate how unique genes inspire new design suggestions for encouraging user contributions in the context of mobile and situated crowdsourcing.}

Comparatively, the progress in wearable chemical sensor development has been slower because of the inherent challenges in retrieving and processing bodily fluids. In this context, sweat provides a rich repository of biomarkers that is accessible continuously, on-the-go, and non-invasively. Here we provide a review of recent trends in the area of wearable sweat sensing with discussions on relevant topics of interest in material science, device development, sensing mechanisms, power generation, and data management.

abstract = {During the last decade, significant research has been conducted in the fields of healthcare and the administration of cutting-edge ambient intelligence (AmI) technology. Healthcare experts explored smart gadgets and other medical technologies, as well as ambient intelligence using Internet of Things (IoT) (AIoT). The potential for linking the two regions and improving care for individuals living in rural and distant areas is apparent. The healthcare industry has seen tremendous advances in efficiency, affordability, and usefulness as a result of new growth possibilities and drastic cost reductions. This includes a how-to guide on how medical advancements may be both helpful and detrimental as a result of (AIoT-based) technology. The AIoT-H application is anticipated to be covered in the last section since it has the ability to assist with current and varied technologies, and relevant approaches for solving healthcare problems are examined. Furthermore, many potential problems and inconsistencies with the AIoT-H method are often identified. Current and future academics interested in the subject will be able to examine a wide range of possible AIoT-H implementations in order to get a better understanding of the effect and influence on any of the many AIoT applications.}

abstract = {Heat waves are becoming more common and intense around the world as a result of climate change, and they are affecting the resilience and livability of cities. Extreme heat can be fatal for people who are unacclimated or unable to seek relief. Heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable, yet public health efforts can at times fail to account for important contextual factors in their policy responses (e.g., differential vulnerability due to pre-existing medical conditions, where people live or work, or people's self-perception of risk). Understanding these contextual factors is an essential foundation for identifying policy responses that can make tangible progress in reducing heat-related illnesses and saving lives during extreme heat events. While extreme heat is an issue faced by communities internationally, we contend that a state or region-specific contextual and problem-oriented policy analysis, such as we present here, is critical to saving lives because: (1) many of the factors driving extreme heat vulnerability are local in nature and (2) the resilience strategies best suited to improve public health outcomes generally rely on local and state policy. This article examines the key factors conditioning public health impacts of extreme heat in Washington state based on the framework of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. Drawing upon our analysis of heat vulnerability in Washington state, we examine a suite of policy options within the context of Washington's communities that are tailored to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, or recover from heat waves and reduce heat-related illness and death in urban or suburban settings. We find extreme heat affects subpopulations differentially because of various contextual factors; this suggests a wide range of policy alternatives is necessary to meaningfully improve health outcomes community wide. Moreover, the array of policy alternatives often rely on agencies whose missions do not prioritize public health. We conclude that without mechanisms for formal coordination among implementing partners and agencies with an important role in protecting public health, important policy alternatives that serve vulnerable subpopulations will likely be neglected. We present this problem-oriented analysis of extreme heat in Washington state as a case study for identifying and evaluating contextually specific climate resilience strategies in the hopes that it can be useful across other geographies with different governance contexts, and perhaps even for other climate impacts.}

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

abstract = {Aims
To determine the accuracy of a wearable sensor to detect and differentiate episodes of self-reported craving and stress in individuals with substance use disorders, and to assess acceptability, barriers, and facilitators to sensor-based monitoring in this population.
Methods
This was an observational mixed methods pilot study. Adults enrolled in an outpatient treatment program for a substance use disorder wore a non-invasive wrist-mounted sensor for four days and self-reported episodes of stress and craving. Continuous physiologic data (accelerometry, skin conductance, skin temperature, and heart rate) were extracted from the sensors and analyzed via various machine learning algorithms. Semi-structured interviews were conducted upon study completion, and thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative data from semi-structured interviews.
Results
Thirty individuals completed the protocol, and 43 % (N = 13) were female. A total of 41 craving and 104 stress events were analyzed. The differentiation accuracies of the top performing models were as follows: stress vs. non-stress states 74.5 % (AUC 0.82), craving vs. no-craving 75.7 % (AUC 0.82), and craving vs. stress 76.8 % (AUC 0.8). Overall participant perception was positive, and acceptability was high. Emergent themes from the exit interviews included a perception of connectedness and increased mindfulness related to wearing the sensor, both of which were reported as helpful to recovery. Barriers to engagement included interference with other daily wear items, and perceived stigma.
Conclusions
Wearable sensors can be used to objectively differentiate episodes of craving and stress, and individuals in recovery from substance use disorder are accepting of continuous monitoring with these devices.}

The push for green and eco-friendly materials has intensified, driven by the mounting environmental concerns associated with traditional petroleum-based products. As land resources shrink and space for development narrows, marine biomaterials have emerged as a promising alternative over the past decades. Well-known for their vast availability, outstanding biocompatibility, impressive biodegradability, and minimal toxicity, marine biomaterials present an ideal foundation for developing eco-friendly triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this review, we present the evolution of TENGs based on marine biomaterials, from their core working principles to their multifaceted applications. We begin by elucidating the operational modes and foundational principles of TENGs. Next, we highlight the intrinsic qualities and advantages of marine biomaterials commonly utilized in TENG designs. Additionally, we discuss approaches adopted to amplify the efficacy of TENGs derived from marine biomaterials. A synthesis of documented applications of these TENGs from existing literature is then presented. We finally discuss the existing challenges and future directions in marine biomaterial-inspired TENGs.}

Our objective has been to examine the current research in wearable to serve as references for researchers and provide perspectives for future research.
Methods
Herein, we review the current research and development of and the challenges facing SWS for HM, focusing on multi-parameter physiological sensor systems and activity and mobility measurement system designs that reliably measure mobility or vital signs and integrate real-time decision support processing for disease prevention, symptom detection, and diagnosis. For this literature review, we have chosen specific selection criteria to include papers in which wearable systems or devices are covered.
Results
We describe the state of the art in SWS and provide a survey of recent implementations of wearable health-care systems. We describe current issues, challenges, and prospects of SWS.
Conclusion
We conclude by identifying the future challenges facing SWS for HM.}

The measurement model was confirmed in both studies without any modifications. In both studies, the trust in technological companies and the trust in government agencies did not predict the perceived acceptance. In the first study, perceived availability of online risks predicted the acceptance through the full mediation of perceived online risks. The acceptance was also explained by perceived benefits. In the second study, the same structure was meaningful; however, the perceived risk was predicted by perceived benefits as well. Perceived benefits, acceptance and trust in technological companies were stronger among preservice teachers; whereas online risk perceptions were stronger among in-service teachers probably due to age-related risk perception differences.}

Since no objective measure of the actual stress level (output) is available, finding the stress index cannot be addressed as a classical regression problem. Instead, the proposed approach finds the linear combination of features that maximizes the separability of stress index values for non-stress and stress events. In short, RASMa combines linear discriminant analysis with the Bhattacharyya distance, embedded in a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme. A 26-case pilot study using 17 heart rate variability (HRV) features was conducted as a proof of concept. A near real-time application tool for monitoring stress level over time was also implemented based on the model obtained from the pilot study.}

Despite considerable technological advances that have alleviated many operational challenges associated with a WZ, social concerns about safety and mobility near WZs remain. Notably, the concept of a Smart Work Zone (SWZ) emerged from the compelling need to improve the safety and mobility of traffic and other WZ participants. This study reviewed the literature to assimilate studies related to SWZ Systems (SWZSs), report their findings, and ascertain a future path forward. Method: To accomplish this, the existing WZ-related literature base was clustered into safety and traffic mobility topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling. A thorough investigation of the pivotal inferences for the research topics was undertaken to comprehend current SWZ technologies and the need for further research. Results: The review uncovered the prominent features of SWZSs reported in the literature and the hindrances to their adoption. The most reported hindrances are the cost and effort associated with development, installation, and relocation. We uncover that Connected Autonomous Vehicles, vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, along with technology-based worker training are the most promising next frontier for SWZ. Conclusion: Significant research gaps exist in the literature regarding developing and implementing SWZS. Additionally, little effort has been directed toward developing workers’ skills and competency. Practical approaches such as Virtual Reality (VR)-based training are necessary to bring workers up to pace with the developing SWZ technologies. Practical Applications: Future research should be directed towards interconnecting and implementing available safety technologies to automate WZ safety and management. Workers should be trained using more practical techniques. In this context, using VR will enable the simulation of hazardous events in a safe environment while also improving workers’ skill retention.}

These processes are the creation of technology and data capture, operation and decision making, inspection and impact assessment, and refinement of technology and data. We expand our discussion by highlighting how to managerially effectuate CDR compliant behavior based on an organizational culture perspective. Our conceptualization unlocks future research opportunities, especially regarding pertinent antecedents and consequences.

abstract = {High quality, reliable data and robust models are central to the development and appraisal of transportation planning and policy. Although conventional data may offer good ‘content’, it is widely observed that it lacks context i.e. who and why people are travelling. Transportation modelling has developed within these boundaries, with implications for the planning, design and management of transportation systems and policy-making. This paper establishes the potential of passively collected GPS-based “Track & Trace” (T&T) datasets of individual mobility profiles towards enhancing transportation modelling and policy-making. T&T is a type of New and Emerging Data Form (NEDF), lying within the broader ‘Big Data’ paradigm, and is typically collected using mobile phone sensors and related technologies. These capture highly grained mobility content and can be linked to the phone owner/user behavioural choices and other individual context. Our meta-analysis of existing literature related to spatio-temporal mobile phone data demonstrates that NEDF’s, and in particular T&T data, have had little mention to date within an applied transportation planning and policy context. We thus establish there is an opportunity for policy-makers, transportation modellers, researchers and a wide range of stakeholders to collaborate in developing new analytic approaches, revise existing models and build the skills and related capacity needed to lever greatest value from the data, as well as to adopt new business models that could revolutionise citizen participation in policy-making. This is of particular importance due to the growing awareness in many countries for a need to develop and monitor efficient cross-sectoral policies to deliver sustainable communities.}

abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has consumed our healthcare system, with immediate resource focus on the management of high numbers of critically ill patients. Those that fare poorly with COVID-19 infection more commonly have cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and diabetes. There are also several other conditions that raise concern for the welfare of patients with and at high risk for CVD during this pandemic. Traditional ambulatory care is disrupted and many patients are delaying or deferring necessary care, including preventive care. New impediments to medication access and adherence have arisen. Social distancing measures can increase social isolation and alter physical activity and nutrition patterns. Virtually all facility based cardiac rehabilitation programs have temporarily closed. If not promptly addressed, these changes may result in delayed waves of vulnerable patients presenting for urgent and preventable CVD events. Here, we provide several recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects of these disruptions in outpatient care. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be continued in patients already taking these medications. Where possible, it is strongly preferred to continue visits via telehealth, and patients should be counselled about promptly reporting new symptoms. Barriers to medication access should be reviewed with patients at every contact, with implementation of strategies to ensure ongoing provision of medications. Team-based care should be leveraged to enhance the continuity of care and adherence to lifestyle recommendations. Patient encounters should include discussion of safe physical activity options and access to healthy food choices. Implementation of adaptive strategies for cardiac rehabilitation is recommended, including home based cardiac rehab, to ensure continuity of this essential service. While the practical implementation of these strategies will vary by local situation, there are a broad range of strategies available to ensure ongoing continuity of care and health preservation for those at higher risk of CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

Participants completed the crime scene report using either the conventional paper form, an electronic form on a tablet computer (to represent the current trend in digitisation of crime scene reports), or a wearable computer (with speech input). While both computer conditions (tablet and wearable) led to faster performance, when compared with the paper condition, there was no difference in content or quality of the reports produced in any of the three conditions; thus, the computer conditions produced acceptable reports in much faster time when compared to conventional practice. Furthermore, activity sampling analysis showed that participants found it much easier to integrate the wearable computer (than either paper forms or tablet computer) into their search and recovery activity.}

This paper examines how people rely, understand and trust tornado alerts and the Early Warning Systems (EWS) that disseminate them, if socio-demographics cause specific groups to experience greater risk, whether these factors have affected the rise in fatalities and what mitigation measures could reverse this. Ford County, Kansas, was selected as a case study. Interviews were conducted with officials and an online survey marketed through Facebook was undertaken, receiving 547 responses. Results showed white men were particularly vulnerable to tornadoes as they were more likely to ignore warnings. Hispanics, older people and those with tornado experience were also at higher risk if they heard an alert from an EWS they distrusted or did not understand. Population growth in these groups and technology changes have helped cause the recent fatality rise and, unless changes are made to the EWS, the continued increase in size of these groups will lead to more people becoming at risk from, or perishing in, tornadoes. Recommendations to prevent this include federal regulation and improved education materials for sirens, alerts translated into Spanish, discontinuing NOAA radio and developing an official forecast and alerting app.}

Wearable electrochemical sensors enable obtaining insights into individuals' health status through the noninvasive monitoring of clinically relevant biomarkers in different biofluids (saliva, tears, sweat, and interstitial fluids) without complex manipulation, sampling, and treatment steps. The electrochemical system can be fabricated in different substrates and transferred to the human body or coupled to common utensils to monitor (bio)chemical species or potentially hazardous compounds surrounding the users without disturbing their usual activities.

This research compared shooting performance and underlying postural mechanics of Expert and Novice marksmen during a dynamic, live-fire shooting task. Eighteen military personnel volunteered to participate in this study (n = 9 Experts and n = 9 Novices). All participants completed the dynamic marksmanship task with an M4 carbine under each of two equipment conditions: (I) a No Load Condition (6 kg) and (II) a Loaded Condition (31 kg) using standard-issue military equipment. Marksmanship performance was assessed using lethality measures including total hits and course efficiency. Postural mechanics were collected via body- and weapon-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Significant differences (p < 0.05) in shooting performance and course efficiency were found between Expert and Novice marksmen for both load conditions. Significant differences were also found in postural movement patterns between Expert and Novice marksmen utilizing IMU-derived performance measures, especially when transitioning between targets, though these findings were not always consistent across load conditions. Based on these results, training interventions that focus on target acquisition, increasing torso stability, and maximizing the linkage between the torso and weapon could be recommended to improve performance in Novice marksmen.}

The growing use and functionality of UAVs increases the chances that a digital forensics investigation of a UAV could be required to investigate an accident, incident or just the appearance of a UAV in a specific geographical location. As a result, both industry and academia have published a number of guidelines and publications concerning the forensic investigation of UAV systems. The focus of this paper is the academic perspective of UAV forensics. Specifically, we present a systematic survey of the UAV forensics literature, with the purpose of identifying and documenting research trends describing the digital forensic investigation of UAV incidents, accidents and crimes. The findings from the survey identify the need for an enhanced digital forensics framework to help guide future UAV investigations, as well as a number of research themes that are currently unaddressed in the literature. The research contributions are three-fold. First, the paper categorizes, through a taxonomy, previous UAV forensics literature concerning UAV forensics artifacts, frameworks and models for undertaking UAV forensic investigations, forensic readiness for UAVs, and tools that have been used to conduct UAV forensic investigations. Second, using the findings from the literature, we propose and describe the Conceptual Drone Forensic Framework (CDFF), which attempts to address shortcomings in previous UAV forensics models and frameworks. Third, the paper sets the foundation for future research in UAV forensics by proposing three unaddressed research themes that could help enhance future UAV forensic investigations.}

It suggests that, while there are significant similarities between their respective sources, tools and purposes, there are also arguable differences between consumer protection law and data protection law. One such arguable difference is found in that, while consumer protection law can be seen to merely set a floor in its pursuit of a sufficiently high level of consumer protection, data protection law – due to its clearly articulated dual purposes of (a) protecting individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and (b) providing for the free movement of such data – sets both a floor and a ceiling. Having discussed the relationship between consumer protection law and data protection law in more detail, the argument is made that it seems possible to conclude that the balance struck in the Data Protection Directive, and soon in the General Data Protection Regulation, places limitations on consumer protection law. The implications of this conclusion are then examined briefly in the context of some matters currently coming before the CJEU and the contours of a framework are presented, addressing situations where a data protection-based liability claim is pursued against a third-party non-controller under consumer protection law.}

Prior studies look at people's evaluations in isolation without pitting costs and benefits against each other. We address this limitation with a conjoint experiment (N = 979), using six domains (criminal investigations, crime prevention, citizen scores, healthcare, banking, and employment), where we simultaneously test the relative influence of four factors: the status quo, outcome favorability, data sharing, and data protection on decisions to adopt and perceptions of moral acceptability of the technologies. We present two key findings. (1) People adopt technologies more often when data is protected and when outcomes are favorable. They place equal or more importance on data protection in all domains except healthcare where outcome favorability has the strongest influence. (2) Data protection is the strongest driver of moral acceptability in all domains except healthcare, where the strongest driver is outcome favorability. Additionally, sharing data lowers preference for all technologies, but has a relatively smaller influence. People do not show a status quo bias in the adoption of technologies. When evaluating moral acceptability, people show a status quo bias but this is driven by the citizen scores domain. Differences across domains arise from differences in magnitude of the effects but the effects are in the same direction. Taken together, these results highlight that people are not always primarily driven by self-interest and do place importance on potential privacy violations. The results also challenge the assumption that people generally prefer the status quo.}

However, the traditional method of assessing mental health has a margin for improvement. The recent advances in digital technology (e.g., smartphones and wearables) and machine learning techniques can support psychotherapy through the addition of psychophysiology. This paper presents RevitalMe, a context-aware model for assisting a psychotherapeutic understanding of human behavior, providing psychophysiological insights from real-life. Methods: Five volunteers used RevitalMe’s prototype in natural environments for eight days each. Ecological Momentary Assessment was used to collect individuals’ stressful states, and to label real-life data. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was performed to verify a significant difference between the labeled states. Then, RevitalMe classified psychological states based on physiological measurements through machine learning, associating them with the behavior of the individual. After that, visual insights were generated through contexts processing and presented to psychotherapists as evidence of an individual’s daily behavior and psychological state. Twelve psychotherapists evaluated the clinical acceptability of RevitalMe, answering six quantitative statements and two qualitative questions. Furthermore, a t-Test was performed to investigate clinical acceptability given therapy field and clinical years. Results: The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test succeeds in proving that labeled states were statistically significant, and RevitalMe achieved an F1-Score of 75% in the binary classification of stressed states in natural environments. The evaluation showed clinical acceptability of 90%, composed by partial agreement of 62% and a total agreement of 28%. In this regard, the t-Test provided that the level of interest from cognitive-behavior therapists in psychophysiological insight was higher than that from psychodynamic therapists. Conclusions: The psychophysiological insights approximate cognitive-behavior psychotherapy to individual’s behavior and daily events, focusing on assistance in mental healthcare.}

abstract = {One hundred years have passed since the discovery of insulin—an achievement that transformed diabetes from a fatal illness into a manageable chronic condition. The decades since that momentous achievement have brought ever more rapid innovation and advancement in diabetes research and clinical care. To celebrate the important work of the past century and help to chart a course for its continuation into the next, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes and the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recently held a joint international symposium, bringing together a cohort of researchers with diverse interests and backgrounds from both countries and beyond to discuss their collective quest to better understand the heterogeneity of diabetes and thus gain insights to inform new directions in diabetes treatment and prevention. This article summarizes the proceedings of that symposium, which spanned cutting-edge research into various aspects of islet biology, the heterogeneity of diabetic phenotypes, and the current state of and future prospects for precision medicine in diabetes.

abstract = {User cooperative behaviour is mandatory and valuable to warranty data acquisition quality in forensic biometrics. In the present paper, we consider human cooperative behaviour in front of wearable security cameras. Moreover, we propose a human cooperation detection pipeline based on deep learning. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have shown remarkable performance on several tasks such as image captioning, video analysis, or natural language processing. Our proposal describes an RNN architecture with the aim at detecting whether a human is exhibiting an adversarial behaviour by trying to avoid the camera. This data is obtained by analysing the noise patterns of human movement. More specifically, we are not only providing an extensive analysis on the proposed pipeline considering different configurations and a wide variety of RNN types, but also an ensemble of the generated models to outperform each single model. The experiment has been carried out using videos captured from a mobile device camera (GOTCHA Dataset) and the obtained results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Background
Many African hospitals participate in technology research studies that take many months or years. Fewer sites have experience with rapid studies, conducted over a period of weeks. Such studies can benefit the institution and its patients in the short term, and in the long term can help prepare the institution for adopting the new technology.
Objectives
We conducted a rapid validation study of consumer fitness device at Mulago National Referral and Teaching Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. In doing so, we captured valuable lessons about how to conduct a rapid study that will be useful to future researchers conducting similar fast-paced studies.
Methods
We conducted a descriptive study of a convenience sample of 57 patients. Patients who volunteered wore a fitness wristband device. Study staff collected vital signs using standard approaches.
Findings
Our findings were as follows: (1) effective partnership by local experts can ensure success; (2) a PI with experience working with the hospital ethics committee is essential to a rapid study; (3) reassurance that the study design benefits patients and the institution can help speed approval; (4) conduct detailed assessment of patient population in advance; (5) allow sufficient time for logistics arrangements; (6) quickly pivot the approach as needed, consistent with the protocol; (7) conduct data quality review on every shift; (8) conduct a supplies inventory at the end of each shift; (9) make rapid decisions about hiring and discontinuing study staff; (10) implement a patient location protocol at the start of the study; and (11) ensure availability of study staff refreshments in the study room.
Conclusion
A rapid study of innovative technology can be successful at a hospital in a resource-limited setting.}

abstract = {Heating and cooling of buildings consume approximately 15% of all energy used in the United States. Such a large energy demand is primarily due to heating and cooling of the entire building space to temperature setpoints usually between 21.1 °C (70 °F) and 23.9 °C (75 °F). However, even with such a narrow range of temperature setpoints, more than 20% of the occupants do not feel thermally comfortable due to individual differences (e.g. age, gender, clothing, or physiology). The personal thermal management techniques, which create a local thermal envelope around a human body instead of heating or cooling the entire building space, have the potential to greatly reduce the building energy consumption and to enhance thermal comfort of individuals. In this study, a portable thermoelectric energy conversion unit (TECU) that converts electricity into cooling and heating energy is developed. The TECU supplies cool air (in the cooling mode) or warm air (in the heating mode) to regulate the thermal comfort of a human body. The cool or warm air is supplied through a tree-like rubber tube network that is knitted into a thermoregulatory undergarment. To achieve a cooling/heating target that provides satisfactory thermal comfort, the required cooling/heating power supply from the TECU is determined first while a theoretical model is then developed to guide the design of the TECU. To minimize the TECU weight and make it suitable for portable applications, relationships between weight and thermal resistances of commercial off-the-shelf heat sinks are established first, and a method to find the minimal weight of heat sinks for the TECU is then developed. This methodology is also applicable for other applications where heat sink weight needs to be minimized. The thermal manikin tests demonstrate that 24.6 W of personal cooling power and 18.5 W of personal heating power are achieved by using the TECU.}

However, little efforts have been made to quantitatively examine the factors influencing construction workers’ acceptance of PPE. Method: In the current study, a PPE acceptance model for construction workers (PAMCW) was proposed to address the noted need. The PAMCW incorporates the technology acceptance model, theory of planned behavior, risk perception, and safety climate for explaining construction worker acceptance of PPE. 413 construction workers participated in this study to fill out a structured questionnaire. The PAMCW was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results: Results provide evidence of the applicability of the technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior to the PPE acceptance among construction workers. The positive influence of safety climate and risk perception-severity on attitude toward using PPE was significant. Safety climate positively influences perceived usefulness. Risk perception-worry and unsafe was found to positively affect intention to use PPE. Practical Applications: Practical suggestions for increasing construction workers’ use of PPE are also discussed.}

Legislation surrounding the use of in-vehicle technologies are explored in this paper from a socio-technical system perspective. This reveals the wider context of the road transport system operating under the current laws using an Accimap analysis. A distinction in the law between the use of hand-held mobile phones, a device that is typically banned for use by drivers worldwide, and the use of other technological devices that are covered by more general laws against ‘careless’ and/or ‘dangerous’ driving was found. Historically, individual drivers’ have been blamed for distraction, whereas the systems approach shows how current legislation may have created the conditions necessary for driver distraction.}

Creative use of new mobile and wearable health information and sensing technologies (mHealth) has the potential to reduce the cost of health care and improve well-being in numerous ways. These applications are being developed in a variety of domains, but rigorous research is needed to examine the potential, as well as the challenges, of utilizing mobile technologies to improve health outcomes. Currently, evidence is sparse for the efficacy of mHealth. Although these technologies may be appealing and seemingly innocuous, research is needed to assess when, where, and for whom mHealth devices, apps, and systems are efficacious. In order to outline an approach to evidence generation in the field of mHealth that would ensure research is conducted on a rigorous empirical and theoretic foundation, on August 16, 2011, researchers gathered for the mHealth Evidence Workshop at NIH. The current paper presents the results of the workshop. Although the discussions at the meeting were cross-cutting, the areas covered can be categorized broadly into three areas: (1) evaluating assessments; (2) evaluating interventions; and (3) reshaping evidence generation using mHealth. This paper brings these concepts together to describe current evaluation standards, discuss future possibilities, and set a grand goal for the emerging field of mHealth research.}

abstract = {Background
Previous research demonstrates that results from observational research correlate well with results from clinical trials, and if the former are well designed these can guide clinical practice. Observational studies in cardiac arrest research are beset by confounding due to illness severity and comorbidity. We aimed to count the number of studies that utilize comorbidity and illness severity scores and indices, and to measure the change in results across analyses that adjust for scores and indices.
Methods
A systematic search of databases for cardiac arrest studies that report survival outcomes for 2015 and that utilize illness severity and comorbidity indices and scores was conducted. We quantified the proportion of studies and the change in magnitude of estimates when adjustment for indices and scores were used.
Results
Sixty (28%) of 213 cardiac arrest studies that report survival outcomes utilize illness severity or comorbidity indices and scores, of which 39 studies (65%) used risk scores and indices to account for the confounding effect of comorbidity or illness severity. A 14% change towards the null in the magnitude of effect sizes was apparent when models included illness severity or comorbidity adjustment (interquartile range −37.7 to 4.4).
Conclusions
A small proportion of cardiac arrest studies account for illness severity and comorbidity with scores and indices, and such adjustment tend to drive estimates towards the null (no difference in groups being compared). Confounding by illness severity and comorbidity is a significant source of bias in non-randomized cardiac arrest studies.}

The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.}

Healthcare firms have many opportunities to employ IoB to provide individualised services and anticipate patients’ behaviour. As behaviour and analysis are closely related to psychology, many techniques exist to collect relevant data. The IoB improves the doctor’s and patient’s experience. As IoT and IoB are interconnected, IoB technology collects and analyses data depending on user activity. These offer a practical technique for developing real-time remote health monitoring systems. This technology aids in the optimisation of auto insurance premiums in the healthcare sector. It tries to alter patient behaviour in order to improve the treatment process. IoB has applications in various areas, including retail and entertainment, and has the potential to change the marketing sector significantly. This technology is helpful for the appropriate analysis and comprehension of behavioural data used for creating valuable services for treatment. The primary purpose of this paper is to study IoB and its need for healthcare. The working process structure and features of IoB for the healthcare domain are studied. This paper further identifies and analyses the significant applications of IoB for healthcare. In the future, IoB technologies will give us a higher quality of life and well-being. IoB is the ideal fusion of technology, data analytics, and behavioural science. This will help healthcare professionals collect data and analyse the patient’s behaviours for an efficient treatment process. The IoB will be the digital ecosystem’s intelligence in a few years.}

Scholars refer to this shift in becoming creators of technology as computational making, which enables new forms of learning and thinking at the intersection of the physical and the digital. The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. Our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners’ thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making.}

Driving measures are frequently collapsed to summary levels across the study period, excluding more fine-grained differences such as changes that occur from trip to trip. By retaining trip-specific data, it is possible to quantify how much a driver differs from trip to trip (within-person variability) in addition to how he or she differs from other drivers (between-person variability). To the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to use multilevel modeling to quantify variability in distracted driving behavior in a naturalistic dataset of older drivers. The current study demonstrates the utility of examining within-person variability in a naturalistic driving dataset of 68 older drivers across two weeks. First, multilevel models were conducted for three distracted driving behaviors to distinguish within-person variability from between-person variability in these behaviors. A high percentage of variation in distracted driving behaviors was attributable to within-person differences, indicating that drivers’ behaviors varied more across their own driving trips than from other drivers (ICCs = .93). Then, to demonstrate the utility of personal characteristics in predicting daily driving behavior, a hypothetical model is presented using simulated daily sleep duration from the previous night to predict distracted driving behavior the following day. The current study demonstrates substantial variability in driving behaviors within an older adult sample and the promise of individual characteristics to provide better prediction of driving behaviors relevant to safety, which can be applied in investigations of current naturalistic driving datasets and in designing future studies.}

We analyze the case of the Google Glass failure to establish this ARSG (Augmented Reality Smart Glasses) extension to Google's digital platform. The paper contributes to the study of controversies by analyzing the digital platform innovation process as a process of translation, in which there are possible controversy emergence points originated in types of disagreements among the different human actors involved and their interactions with non-human elements. These disagreements are related to specific features of digital platforms: the digital platform generativity, the multisided market arrangements in the platform; the loosely coupled layers of technologies and applications involved, and the opaqueness that results from these arrangements. The framework proposed can support digital platform scholars and practitioners to in better understand and manage controversies.}

Emergency Department (ED) visits are costly to the health service and alternative care pathways may address this whilst improving outcomes. We aimed to describe decision-making and preferences of people with epilepsy (PWE) during emergency service use, and views of ED alternatives, including use of an Urgent Treatment Centre and telephone-based support from an epilepsy nurse specialist.
Methods
We conducted a community-based interview study in South East England, informed by a qualitative framework approach. 25 adults with epilepsy and 5 of their carers took part.
Results
Participants’ choice to attend ED generally corresponded with guidelines, including continuing seizures and injury. Nevertheless, over half reported unwanted or unnecessary ED attendance, mainly due to lack of access to individual patient history, a carer, or seizures occurring in a public place. Participants used proactive strategies to communicate their care needs to others, including 24 -h alarm devices and care plans. Some suggested preventative strategies including referral after ED. Participants highlighted the importance of ambulance staff in providing fast and efficient care that gives reassurance.
Conclusion

In exercising these roles DPA's engage in a range of activities centred around understanding new technology developments, and anticipating their potential effects and impacts upon data protection and privacy. As responsible parties in relation to enforcement of national and EU data protection law DPAs are in a clear position to assess or provide guidance upon the requirements of the existing legal framework in relation to new technologies. This paper maps the technology foresight activities of European DPAs, the importance of this activity to their work, the particular challenges they face, and the extent to which such activities are performed in isolation or collaboration. It also assesses the potential for a collaborative EU DPA technology foresight task force.}

However, obtaining accurate long-term data from sweat using current sweat collection methodology raises doubts. Here, we describe a soft-bioelectronic platform that uses a thermal expansion valve to collect sweat under programmed time control. By incorporating expandable microspheres, the skin-interfaced microfluidic device platform merges capillary burst valves and irreversible-thermal expansion valves. An expansion layer below the microfluidic channels expands irreversibly upon heat delivery from underlying microheaters. The thermal expansion valve isolates the collected sweat into separate chambers to minimize internal mixing. The human study demonstrates that our novel time-programmed sweat collection device improved sweat analyte data (sweat volume, pH, lactate, and cortisol) from the conventional sweat collection. In addition, the human study results indicate a correlation between sweat rate and sweat lactate with aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Our approach can be integrated with past and current microfluidic systems and other chemical sensing modalities, such as colorimetric and electrochemical measurements of sweat analytes present in current sweat devices for advanced on-board diagnostics.}

There is little literature examining pedestrian behaviour at RLXs and no previous studies have adopted a formative approach to understanding behaviour in this context. In this article, cognitive work analysis is applied to understand the constraints that shape pedestrian behaviour at RLXs in Melbourne, Australia. The five phases of cognitive work analysis were developed using data gathered via document analysis, behavioural observation, walk-throughs and critical decision method interviews. The analysis demonstrates the complex nature of pedestrian decision making at RLXs and the findings are synthesised to provide a model illustrating the influences on pedestrian decision making in this context (i.e. time, effort and social pressures). Further, the CWA outputs are used to inform an analysis of the risks to safety associated with pedestrian behaviour at RLXs and the identification of potential interventions to reduce risk.}

A substantial amount of research has been conducted on HAR and numerous approaches based on deep learning have been exploited by the research community to classify human activities. The main goal of this review is to summarize recent works based on a wide range of deep neural networks architecture, namely convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for human activity recognition. The reviewed systems are clustered into four categories depending on the use of input devices like multimodal sensing devices, smartphones, radar, and vision devices. This review describes the performances, strengths, weaknesses, and the used hyperparameters of CNN architectures for each reviewed system with an overview of available public data sources. In addition, a discussion of the current challenges to CNN-based HAR systems is presented. Finally, this review is concluded with some potential future directions that would be of great assistance for the researchers who would like to contribute to this field. We conclude that CNN-based approaches are suitable for effective and accurate human activity recognition system applications despite challenges including availability of data regarding composite or group activities, high computational resource requirements, data privacy concerns, and edge computing limitations. For widespread adaptation, future research should be focused on more efficient edge computing techniques, datasets incorporating contextual information with activities, more explainable methodologies, and more robust systems.}

In this sense, the enforcement of the use of masks in crowded areas has been a recurrent concern of governments, which has fostered the development of camera-based approaches to automatically detect people without face masks. In order to tackle this problem, this article proposes a low-cost approach based on the use of affordable and energy-efficient microcontrollers to quickly process images and detect when people are not wearing face masks, performing local decisions. For this on-the-edge processing, reduced Machine Learning models were created and evaluated through different techniques. As a result, a complete processing pipeline was designed to perform a transfer learning process taking as reference the MobileNet model supported by the Edge Impulse platform, achieving an innovative TinyML solution for quick decisions on resource-constrained Internet of Things units. Additionally, we performed a series of experiments on the Arduino Nano 33 board attached to an OV7675 camera module, evaluating the practical application of the proposed solution after proper training using public image datasets. Working as a soft-sensor unit that is reproducible and ready to be used, the defined trainable model and the performed evaluation results represent a significant contribution towards real-world deployment of face masks detection systems.}

abstract = {Context
Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task.
Objective
This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand.
Method
GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime.
Results
We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community – the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.
Conclusion
GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.}

abstract = {Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have become the primary health concern for most countries around the world. Currently, more than 36 million people worldwide die from NCDs each year, accounting for 63% of annual global deaths; most are preventable. The global financial burden of NCDs is staggering, with an estimated 2010 global cost of $6.3 trillion (US dollars) that is projected to increase to $13 trillion by 2030. A number of NCDs share one or more common predisposing risk factors, all related to lifestyle to some degree: (1) cigarette smoking, (2) hypertension, (3) hyperglycemia, (4) dyslipidemia, (5) obesity, (6) physical inactivity, and (7) poor nutrition. In large part, prevention, control, or even reversal of the aforementioned modifiable risk factors are realized through leading a healthy lifestyle (HL). The challenge is how to initiate the global change, not toward increasing documentation of the scope of the problem but toward true action—creating, implementing, and sustaining HL initiatives that will result in positive, measurable changes in the previously defined poor health metrics. To achieve this task, a paradigm shift in how we approach NCD prevention and treatment is required. The goal of this American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation/American College of Preventive Medicine policy statement is to define key stakeholders and highlight their connectivity with respect to HL initiatives. This policy encourages integrated action by all stakeholders to create the needed paradigm shift and achieve broad adoption of HL behaviors on a global scale.}
