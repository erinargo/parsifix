abstract = {A city can be considered a carrier of multiple sources of data and information that are updated in real time and experiences continuous operation and development. Therefore, a system that can obtain and manage data/information gathered from different physical objects in a city in real time is needed. Digital twin (DT) technology is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle; it is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help with decision-making. However, how to apply these features of the DT to better manage smart cities (SCs) has not yet been systematically summarized and analysed. In this study, 202 papers on DT-supported SCs are reviewed, based on which the drivers and challenges of applying DT-supported SCs and the solutions for the challenges were identified. In addition, this study explored the possible outcomes of applying DT-supported technologies in SCs. This study also contributes to the DT-supported SCs for city management research and practice.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology involving a Virtual Reality (VR)-based Belief, Desire, and Intention (BDI) software agent to construct crowd simulation and demonstrates the use of the same for crowd evacuation management under terrorist bomb attacks in public areas. The proposed BDI agent framework allows modeling of human behavior with a high degree of fidelity. The realistic attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are reverse-engineered by conducting human-in-the-loop experiments in the VR-based Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes (e.g., maps, demographics, evacuation management parameters). The validity of the proposed data models are tested with two different evacuation scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effect of various crowd evacuation management parameters on the key performance indicators in the evacuation scenario such as crowd evacuation rate and densities. The results reveal that constructed simulation can be used as an effective emergency management tool.}

abstract = {Given the global increase in crippling cyberattacks, organizations are increasingly turning to cyberthreat intelligence (CTI). CTI represents actionable threat information that is relevant to a specific organization and that thus demands its close attention. CTI efforts aim to help organizations “know their enemies better” for proactive, preventive, and timely threat detection and remediation—complementing conventional risk-management paradigms designed to improve ‘general readiness’ against known or unknown threats. Organizational security (OrgSec) and behavioral security research has lagged behind CTI's growing potential to address current cybersecurity challenges. Instead, CTI has largely been the purview of computer science from an algorithmic perspective. However, OrgSec and behavioral researchers can contribute a further combined knowledge of design for the organization, human factors, and organizational governance to foster CTI. In this theory-building and review manuscript, we propose the CTI capability model (CTI-CM) to prescribe the key capabilities necessary for a CTI practitioner to engage effectively in CTI activities. The CTI-CM defines a practitioner's CTI capability in terms of three highly interrelated but conceptually distinctive dimensions: analytical component capability, contextual response capability, and experiential practice capability. We further explain how these capabilities can be fostered, and the key implications for leading security practice in organizations.}

However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city’s best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city’s digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation.}

Uptimes can be managed by both improving the maintenance decision making as well as considering appropriate service supply chain design decisions. Furthermore, the integration of Industry 4.0 tools can further boost the previous with its communication and connectivity ability. Knowledge on these aspects is available in academia as well as in practice, but, as this paper argues, not structured for making decisions that consider all of these aspects in an integrated way aiming at improving equipment uptime. Through literature review, we assess the existing literature on IPS2.

Urban spaces are facing a number of challenges from climate mitigation to negative effects on communities. In this context, nature-based solutions aim to promote nature as an answer to the current climate challenge, linking positive outcomes for society in a cost-effective way. Urban nature could benefit from the implementation of technology to enhance nature experiences and nature's impact on the community. This study aims to review and synthesise existing literature focusing on the associations between digital placemaking, mental health and wellbeing impact and the use of green and blue spaces while exploring successful case studies. Hundred and seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria, most of them used qualitative methods. The findings provide insights into the potential impact of digital placemaking practices for urban nature on citizens’ wellbeing and mental health. Our results indicated an absence of agreement on the concept of digital placemaking, and a lack of blue space research while nature was presented as a context and passive element. Mental health and wellbeing are mostly approached without specifically examining health indicators or assessing the health impact of these practices. Our study proposes a model offering insights into the broad range of best practices for implementing digital placemaking for nature and wellbeing and represents a key contribution to understanding the innovative application of augmenting NBS through digital placemaking impacting the wellbeing of citizens.}

abstract = {This article reviews literature about simulation systems for training in healthcare regarding the prevalence of human-centered approaches in the design and development of these systems, motivated by a tradition in this field of working technology-centered. The results show that the focus on human needs and context of use is limited. It is argued that a reduction of the focus on technical advancements in favor of the needs of the users and the healthcare community, underpinned by human factors and ergonomics theory, is favorable. Due to the low number of identified articles describing or discussing human-centered approaches it is furthermore concluded that the publication culture promotes technical descriptions and summative evaluations rather than descriptions and reflections regarding the design and development processes. Shifting the focus from a technology-centered approach to a human-centered one can aid in the process of creating simulation systems for training in healthcare that are: 1) relevant to the learning objectives, 2) adapted to the needs of users, context and task, and 3) not selected based on technical or fidelity criteria.}

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes. This paper pointed out the current intriguing challenges, canvassed the mitigation techniques, and plausible future research opportunities that may privilege the pursuit of this vision.}

A total of 376 survey responses were collected from two national pilot smart cities (Busan and Sejong) in South Korea, and partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypotheses. Among the three stimuli factors, the citizens of Busan perceived the importance of ubiquity and autonomy most highly. However, the citizens of Sejong considered information exchange and ubiquity as crucial determinants of satisfaction. The findings revealed that the significant stimuli factors are not the same between smart cities, and there can be differences in the detailed attributes required in smart cities.}

Innovative assistance techniques are especially necessary for elderly people who live on their own in their homes. Simultaneously, an explosive growth in IoT gadgets such as sensors and actuators have accelerated the development of smart homes which comprise various types of IoT systems that provide increased convenience to people with degenerating physical and cognitive abilities. Common examples of IoT systems that are being integrated into smart homes include home automation systems, home activity detectors, wearable sensor technologies for remote health management and so on. We identify the common needs of aging and impaired individuals and then we review several IoT applications that can provide the required support.

One of the factors propelling MEC’s evolution is the ability to deploy edge servers capable of providing both communication and computational services in close proximity to the mobile user terminal. MEC has been regarded as a potentially transformative technique for fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless communication systems, as well as a possible complement to traditional cloud computing. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with MEC will play a critical role by introducing an additional mobility based computational layer to provide more secure, efficient and faster services. UAV enabled MEC offers seamless connectivity, fulfilling the promise of 5G’s ubiquitous connectivity. Due to the enormous interest in UAV enabled MEC, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of published research articles in this domain; however, the research area still lacks a systematic study and categorization. We present a systematic literature review (SLR) on UAV enabled MEC, examining and analyzing data on the current state of the art using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. To streamline our assessment, this study analyzes several research papers carefully selected through a multi-stage process satisfying the eligibility criteria defined in the paper. One of the SLR’s primary contributions is to broadly classify the research in the UAV enabled MEC domain into different categories including energy efficiency, resource allocation, security, architecture, and latency. We have identified key findings, technology, and pros and cons for the selected articles under each category. Additionally, we discuss the key open issues related to scalability and fairness, resource allocation and offloading optimization, service delivery with a focus on quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS), and standardization. Finally, we discuss several future research directions that would address the aforementioned issues and emerging use cases for UAV enabled MEC.}

A new fully unsupervised anomaly detection and classification method has been proposed. It has three stages: training of a 3D Convolution Autoencoder using pseudo-labelled video segments, anomaly detection using latent features, and classification. Unlike the existing datasets, we have benchmarked RareAnom using three levels of supervision: fully, weakly, and unsupervised. It has been compared with UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets.

abstract = {Indoor positioning has attracted considerable interest in both the industry and academic communities because of its wide range of applications, such as asset tracking, healthcare and context-aware services like targeted advertisements. While there are many indoor localisation methods, each has its advantages and disadvantages, taking into consideration various factors such as the effect of the indoor environment, ease of implementation, computational cost, positioning accuracy, etc. In other words, no single solution can cater for all different situations. Although many survey papers have been published on indoor positioning, new techniques and methods are proposed every year, so it is important to stay abreast of its latest developments. In addition, each survey has its own classification for indoor positioning systems without a common scheme. Inspired by the well-known OSI model and TCP/IP model, it would be desirable to develop a systematic framework for studying indoor positioning systems. In this paper, we make this new contribution by introducing a systemic survey framework based on a six-layer model to give a comprehensive survey of indoor positioning systems, namely: device layer, communication layer, network layer, data layer, method layer and application layer. Complementing the previous survey papers, this paper provides a survey of the latest research works on indoor positioning based on the six-layer model. Our emphasis is on systematic categorisation, machine learning-based enhancements, collaborative localisation and COVID-19-related applications. The six-layer model should provide a useful framework and new insights for the research community.}

abstract = {Human skeleton posture reconstruction is an essential component for human–computer interactions (HCI) in various application domains. Traditional approaches usually rely on either cameras or on-body sensors, which induce privacy concerns or inconvenient practical setups. To address these practical concerns, this paper proposes a low-cost contactless skeleton posture reconstruction system, mPose, which can reconstruct a user’s 3D skeleton postures using a single mmWave device. mPose does not require the user to wear any sensors and can enable a broad range of emerging mobile applications (e.g., VR gaming and pervasive user input) via mmWave-5G ready Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Particularly, the system extracts multi-dimensional spatial information from mmWave signals which characterizes the skeleton postures in a 3D space. To mitigate the impacts of environmental changes, mPose dynamically detects the user location and extracts spatial features from the mmWave signals reflected only from the user. Furthermore, we develop a deep regression method with a domain discriminator to learn a mapping between the spatial features and the joint coordinates of human body while removing subject-specific characteristics, realizing robust posture reconstruction across users. Extensive experiments, involving 17 representative body postures, 7 subjects, and 3 indoor environments, show that mPose outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art RF-based solutions with a lower average joint error of only ∼30 mm, while achieving transferability across environments and subjects at the same time.}

abstract = {In the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, tsunami inundation caused devastating damage over a wide area along the coast of the Tohoku region. Since then, hazard maps for tsunami flooding have been prepared or updated nationwide. These maps assume flooding in the event of a tsunami of the extreme class (L2) with a recurrence interval of 1000 years, in which the top priority is to protect lives. However, once an earthquake occurs, the situation of inundation differs depending on the earthquake rupture mechanisms and its magnitude, so the area of unexpected damage needs to be grasped as soon as possible. Therefore, a forecast of tsunami inundation and damage needs to be provided immediately after the disaster to support disaster responders’ decisions. In this paper, we propose a framework to utilize a tsunami inundation and damage forecast. Specifically, we introduce “recovery levels”, which allow areas that need immediate response to be more easily recognized to allocate human and physical resources. We evaluated their usefulness from the viewpoint of disaster responders by surveying users in a local government through a disaster response drill and an explanatory meeting. Consequently, it was found that the recognition and understanding of the tsunami forecast advanced, and many positive opinions were obtained about utilizing the forecast in the initial activity of disaster response.}

Consequently, several Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies have been proposed. In this paper, we analyze some AOSE methodologies, including Gaia, which supports the architectural design stage, and some proposed extensions. We then use an adapted version of this methodology to design an abstract generic system meta-model for a multi-robot application, which can be used as a basis for the design of these systems, avoiding or shortening repetitive tasks common to most systems. Based on the proposed Generic Robotic Agent Meta-Model (GRAMM), two distinct models for two different applications are derived, demonstrating the versatility and adaptability of the meta-model. By adapting the Gaia methodology to the design of open systems, this work makes the designers’ job faster and easier, decreasing the time needed to complete several tasks, while at the same time maintaining a high-level overview of the system.}

Amplified by the speed and scope of social media, they can quickly reach millions of people and result in a wide range of marketplace deceptions. However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn. We then accumulate and present knowledge on the strategies and mechanisms to safeguard against deepfake-based marketplace deception. Furthermore, we uncover and report the various legitimate opportunities offered by this new technology. Finally, we present an agenda for future research in this emergent and highly critical area.}

abstract = {Objective
Virtual (VR), augmented (AR), mixed reality (MR) and haptic interfaces make additional avenues available for surgeon assessment, guidance and training. We evaluated applications for open trauma and emergency surgery to address the question: Have new computer-supported interface developments occurred that could improve trauma training for civilian and military surgeons performing open, emergency, non-laparoscopic surgery?
Design
Systematic literature review.
Setting and Participants
Faculty, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore., Maryland; Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.
Methods
Structured literature searches identified studies using terms for virtual, augmented, mixed reality and haptics, as well as specific procedures in trauma training courses. Reporting bias was assessed. Study quality was evaluated by the Kirkpatrick's Level of evidence and the Machine Learning to Asses Surgical Expertise (MLASE) score.
Results
Of 422 papers identified, 14 met inclusion criteria, included 282 enrolled subjects, 20% were surgeons, the remainder students, medics and non-surgeon physicians. Study design was poor and sample sizes were low. No data analyses were beyond descriptive and the highest outcome types were procedural success, subjective self-reports, except three studies used validated metrics. Among the 14 studies, Kirkpatrick's level of evidence was level zero in five studies, level 1 in 8 and level 2 in one. Only one study had MLASE Score greater than 9/20. There was a high risk of bias in 6 studies, uncertain bias in 5 studies and low risk of bias in 3 studies.
Conclusions
There was inadequate evidence that VR,MR,AR or haptic interfaces can facilitate training for open trauma surgery or replace cadavers. Because of limited testing in surgeons, deficient study and technology design, risk of reporting bias, no current well-designed studies of computer-supported technologies have shown benefit for open trauma, emergency surgery nor has their use shown improved patient outcomes. Larger more rigorously designed studies and evaluations by experienced surgeons are required for a greater variety of procedures and skills.

Possibilities of the application are, among others: selection of visibility level of certain organs or groups of organs, creation of complex sections in 3 planes and launching animations of selected organs. Application of each selected device required additional programming work. The work included both adaptation of Graphical User Interface for different display resolutions, as well as preparation of communication between integrated orientation tracking systems and the application, because none of the selected low-cost HMDs has a position tracking system, to allow navigation in the virtual space, two low-cost solutions were proposed, as well as traditional approach in form of a professional tracking system. First of the proposed low-cost solutions is application of a dedicated, customized controller built in the PUT VR Laboratory using commercial electronics and 3D printing technologies. The second solution is controlling the navigation via specific gestures recognized by the Kinect low-cost tracking device. After application was developed, a group of students tested all possibilities of interaction with the virtual environment using a professional HMD and both low-cost display and tracking solutions. During the evaluation performed by the test group, features like field of view, weight of devices and general impressions and feeling after prolonged use were taken into consideration. Intuitiveness of the proposed navigation solutions was evaluated separately. The evaluation performed by the test group can be used during work on subsequent versions of the medical educational application and design of new peripheral devices.}

Currently, because of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in facility O&M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O&M research and application developments from a facility manager's point of view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising future research directions. The scope of this research includes the academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using BIM to improve selected facility O&M activities, including maintenance and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation management, and security. The content analysis results show that research on BIM for O&M is still in its early stage and most of the current research has focused on energy management. We have identified that the interoperability in the BIM-O&M context is still a challenge and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to understand the underlying O&M principles for BIM implementation – data requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition, more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are required to justify the value of BIM-O&M applications and an improved Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications.}

The archetypes in part overlap with and confirm previous research, and in part are novel. They all involve stress-point critical conditions in the external environment. We explain why the six archetypes, as a foresight framework, is more transformational and nuanced than previously developed scenario archetypes frameworks, making it particularly suited to the current necessity to think the unthinkable more systematically. We explain how the six archetypes framework can be used as predetermined images of the future to create domain specific scenarios, making organizations more resilient to critical, disruptive futures.

abstract = {The management of crisis situations has been a challenging problem from different points of views, such as communication efficiency and avoiding casualties. This paper presents a novel approach that includes an interaction organization pattern for Multi-agent Systems (MASs) in crisis management, abstracted from several existing case studies in which the agents follow a sequence of interactions and the organization must optimize the use of human resources. The pattern considers an emergent organization of peers that adopt different roles according to the circumstances. The key features of the organization are its robustness, scalability (in terms of both agents and roles), flexibility to deal with a changing environment, and the efficient use of resources. In order to validate the organization, the paper presents its modeling and development with the Ingenias methodology, conforming the corresponding MAS. This development follows a model-driven approach, which allows a smooth transition from the specification to the code, and a low-cost testing of the system with different settings. Another key aspect is the application of metrics for validating and improving the MAS in terms of response time. The MAS has been tested with 600 agents representing 200 citizens, showing its performance.}

The video objects are detected using a novel temporal differencing based procedure and several mathematical morphology-based operations. Then, our technique determines what moving image objects represent pedestrian people, by testing several conditions related to human bodies and detecting the skin regions from the movie frames. A robust human tracking method using a Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) based template matching process is then introduced in our paper. Some person detection and tracking experiments and method comparisons are also described.}

This paper, based on the data from China’s OpenStreetMap road network in May 2014, taking 340 prefecture-level cities in China as its study area, presents the geometric-related (road density) and attribute-related (type diversity) spatial patterns of the OpenStreetMap road network, and explores their relationship. The results are as follows. (1) The distribution of OpenStreetMap road density in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao predominantly obeys a “positive skewness distribution”. OpenStreetMap data for eastern China shows a higher overall and circular structure. In central China, there are noticeable discrepancies in the road density, whereas in western China, the road density is low. (2) The OpenStreetMap road diversity shows a normal distribution. The spatial pattern for the so-called “Hu Huanyong line” was broken by the effect of diplomatic and strategic factors, showing a high diversity along the peripheral border, coastal cities, and core inland cites. (3) China’s OpenStreetMap is partitioned into four parts according to road density and diversity: high density and high diversity; low density and low diversity; high density and low diversity; and low density high diversity. (4) The OpenStreetMap geographical information-collection process and mechanism were analyzed, demonstrating that the road density reflects the preponderance of traffic in the real world. OpenStreetMap road diversity reflects the road-related geographic information demand and value, and it also reflects the interests of users toward to OpenStreetMap geographical information.}

To provide a comprehensive overview on the utilization and effectiveness of telesimulation in healthcare education.
Design
A scoping review.
Data sources
A search of five databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, EMBASE and ProQuest was conducted between 2000 and 2022.
Review methods
Arksey and O′ Malley's scoping review framework was utilised. Data were narratively synthesised.
Results
29 articles were included. More than half of the publications on telesimulation were borne out of need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovation reports were the most prevalent publications followed by descriptive studies. Telesimulation was applied for the delivery of diverse learning content including patient care management, procedural skills and team training. A variety of videoconferencing software and simulation modalities have been used for telesimulation. Telesimulation was generally well-received, despite its technical challenges. Learning effectiveness of telesimulation was evident in quasi-experimental studies.
Conclusion
Telesimulation has been gaining acceptance as a distance-based simulation education modality. It will continue to evolve and potentially blend with in-person simulation. More rigorous research is warranted to evaluate learning outcomes and establish best practices in telesimulation.}

The authors implemented this research by using the Personal Dead Reckoning positioning system to serve as the inertial navigation based positioning system. The primary contribution of the presented work is the development and implementation of the Integrated Tracking System algorithm which was implemented in two levels. At the first level, the Integrated Tracking System (ITS) was developed by integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) and Personal Dead Reckoning (PDR) system to ubiquitously track a mobile user, in dynamic environments where GPS coverage may be uncertain. At the second level, the PDR system was integrated with a database of pre-determined known indoor location points in order to correct the accumulated drift error during a mobile user’s navigation in an indoor environment. Finally, a hybrid tracking system was developed and implemented by integrating the PDR system with the mobile user’s intervention and discernment of the environment. The implementation and the results obtained from validation experiments performed on the aforementioned hybrid tracking systems demonstrate the potential of using hybrid tracking for determining the spatial context of mobile users in ubiquitous context-aware engineering applications.}

abstract = {Crowd anomaly detection has been a research hotspot in the field of video surveillance in recent years. In most existing methods, the accuracy of anomaly detection dominantly relies on the acquisition of regions of interest (ROI) and feature extraction. However, the randomness of ROI segmentation and crowd group selection usually cannot guarantee a robust performance and thus may lead to false detection sometimes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a scene perception-based approach combining the fluid forces expression and psychological theory. The proposed method firstly introduces a flow field Visualization technology called line integral convolution to segment the moving pedestrians in the scene. Then, a scene perception-guided clustering strategy is proposed to cluster the consistency crowd group. Scene perception strategy is in line with the psychological criteria of human cognition. In clustering, it makes more reasonable use of various attributes of the pedestrians. To ensure a robust detection of the pedestrian group, we propose a fluid feature concept which considers both mass force and surface force. For each consistency group, two types of features including the image appearance feature and fluid feature are combined to describe pedestrian motion. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in comparison with some existing methods in terms of both frame-level and pixel-level measurements.}

In its disaster safety areas, Daegu Metropolitan City aims to reduce property damage and casualties that may occur because of physical events such as collapse, water-related disasters, and heatwaves by up to 20%. Smart disaster mitigation involves data collection, sharing, and propagation. The entire process is handled on a safety platform called Data hub. According to the Daegu Metropolitan City government, solving social problems and managing disasters is key to a smart city, and it is striving to improve the efficiency of other cities. However, Daegu has limitations because it is a service-oriented smart city, and it is necessary to engage citizens to participate, raise awareness of the smart city, and educate them on the platform.

Digital immersion offers opportunities for people to travel in time, supporting users to experience virtually ancient encounters, space explorations or dangerous natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions. Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse. Although still experimental, Metaverse is expected to revolutionize travel and tourism management and marketing. It empowers destination awareness, positioning and branding, as well as coordination and management, through digital twins. Metaverse provides opportunities to support trip planning, interaction and engagement, effectively transforming consumer behaviour. Visiting and engaging with destinations virtually is expected to motivate real travel, rather than replace it. This paper provides a vision of how Metaverse can revolutionize tourism experiences and transform tourism management and marketing. Drawing on a systematic review of scholarly works, articles from media and industry reports, this study defines and conceptualizes the Metaverse ecosystem for tourism and travel. It explores the foundations of the disruptions that Metaverse brings to tourism destinations and organisations and identifies the building blocks of Metaverse tourism. The study outlines research directions so that the tourism industry can take full advantage of the Metaverse capabilities and opportunities emerging as well as identify challenges for the future.}

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions.}

The primary contribution of the presented work is the design and implementation of a dynamic user-viewpoint tracking scheme in which mobile users’ spatial context is defined not only by their position (i.e., location), but also by their three-dimensional head orientation (i.e., line of sight). This allows the identification of objects and artifacts visible in a mobile user’s field of view with much higher accuracy than was possible by tracking position alone. For outdoor applications, a georeferencing based algorithm has been developed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and magnetic orientation tracking devices [5] to track a user’s dynamic viewpoint. For indoor applications, this study explored the applicability of wireless technologies, in particular Indoor GPS, for dynamic user position tracking in situations where GPS is unavailable. The objectives of this paper are to describe the details of the three-stage-algorithm that has been designed and implemented, and to demonstrate the extent to which positioning technologies such as GPS and Indoor GPS can be used together with high-precision orientation trackers to accurately interpret the fully-qualified spatial context of a mobile user in challenging environments such as those found on construction sites. The obtained results highlight the potential of using location-aware technologies for rapidly identifying and retrieving contextual information in engineering applications.}

After sketching out an ironic dystopia, in which the idea of transparency is foisted upon the public by future technological developments, the author contemplates the relationships between legal regulation and the underlying values in the predictable but unknowable milieu of future life conditions. While studying the immutability of fundamental values, the author offers a brief survey of the role of public opinion, as well as of the limitations of taking into account the majority opinion, followed by a thought experiment about the possible ways of regulating the “Code”, approaching it from the direction of two fundamental rights, the right to human dignity and the freedom of academic research. After reaching conflicting conclusions and making a few suggestions about possible ways to regulate the area, the author makes a proposal about the introduction of a small-scale experimental tool, metaphorically named as a predictive learning model of regulation. Despite the difficulties and the uncertainties, the essay's overall perspective on the role of legal regulation is not a pessimistic one, as long as it is used flexibly and in conjunction with other means of regulation.}

abstract = {With the anticipated explosion of small unmanned aerial vehicles, it is highly likely that operators will be controlling fleets of autonomous vehicles. To fulfill the promise of autonomy, vehicle operators will not be concerned with manual control of the vehicle; instead, they will deal with the overall mission. Furthermore, the one operator to many vehicles is becoming a constant meme with various industries including package delivery, search and rescue, and utility companies. In order for an operator to concurrently control several vehicles, his station must look and behave very differently than the current ground control station instantiations. Furthermore, the vehicle will have to be much more autonomous, especially during non-normal operations, in order to accommodate the knowledge deficit or the information overload of the operator in charge of several vehicles. The expected usage increase of small drones requires presenting the operational information generated by a fleet of heterogeneous autonomous agents to an operator. NASA Langley Research Center's Autonomy Incubator has brought together researchers in various disciplines including controls, trajectory planning, systems engineering, and human factors to develop an integrated system to study autonomy issues. The initial human factors effort is focusing on mission displays that would give an operator the overall status of all autonomous agents involved in the current mission. This paper will discuss the specifics of the mission displays for operators controlling several vehicles.}

abstract = {Building fires are a common urban disaster. The emergence of high-rise, large-scale and inner-complex buildings bring new challenges for fire safety and triggers new demand to upgrade traditional building fire alarm system (FAS). Different from current studies by deploying enormous smart fire sensors to replace FAS, this study addresses this issue from a novel perspective and proposes a cloud-based FAS using Building Information Modelling (BIM) on top of FAS, termed CloudFAS. Firstly, the system framework and the software architecture are designed. Secondly, two key technologies are presented to address two unresolved technical issues: private fire alarm data sharing and alignment of fire sensors with the BIM model. A cloud gateway for fire sensors is developed to address the first problem by capturing the fire alarm data from the fire alarm control unit through the IEEE 1824 standard. Noticing that the fire sensor locations are listed in a sensor installation spreadsheet using natural language, termed as sensor location table (SLT). A natural language processing (NLP)-based sensor-BIM alignment algorithm is proposed to automatically match fire sensors with the BIM model through SLT, which enables to display fire sensor statuses in proper places in the 3D BIM model. Finally, a concrete case study from the China Construction Library is presented, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed CloudFAS. Our CloudFAS is built on top of traditional FAS. If the fire alarm control unit follows the IEEE 1824 standard and an SLT is available, then CloudFAS can upgrade the traditional FAS in existing buildings effortlessly with its BIM model. Moreover, the cloud gateway for fire sensors contributes to addressing the private data sharing problem using IEEE 1824 standard, and the NLP-based sensor-BIM alignment algorithm can promote the adoption of BIM in the building operation phase.}

It is critical for the government to embrace new technology for minimizing costs and maximizing utility of services to the taxpayers.

Quick Response codes (QR codes) provide a means to effectively distribute many different varieties of information to the public. We propose to integrate QR code systems and corresponding smartphone applications into existing government services with the goal of providing a new level of interactivity for the public. We illustrate this through two case studies, examining the National Park Services and the Mobile Environmental Information Services (MENVIS). The focus is on developing a QR code waypoint system for park navigation, as well as incentivizing park use through gamification of site attractions. The system provides increased safety for park goers, disseminates information more effectively and accurately, and improves feedback.}

Through the statistics of the current research and applications of VR training systems in mining industry, all the input/output devices are classified. Based on the classifications of the input/output devices that are used in the VR system, the current VR training systems for the mining industry could be divided into three types: screen-based general type, projector-based customized type, and head-mounted display (HMD)-based intuitive type. By employing a VR headset, a smartphone and a leap motion device, an HMD-based intuitive type VR training system prototype for drilling in underground mines has been developed. Ten trainees tried both the HMD-based intuitive system and the screen-based general control system to compare the experiences and training effects. The results show that the HMD-based system can give a much better user experience and is easy to use. Three of the five components of a VR training system, namely, the user, the tasks, and software and database should be given more attention in future research. With more available technologies of input and output devices, VR engines, and system software, the VR training system will eventually yield much better training results, and will play a more important role in as a training tool for mine safety.}

From the existing literature, it has been observed that deep learning based techniques are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in ITS which in turns provide unforgettable experience to both the users and drivers. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and their variants are widely used for object detection, localization, and classification in modern ITS. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we have reviewed different types of CNN models used in modern ITS for traffic sign recognition, traffic light detection, vehicle classification and pedestrian detection. Various CNN based models and techniques are discussed and compared in comparison to the existing schemes using different performance evaluation metrics.

This priority suggests that stakeholders must understand the possible impacts on their property and assets, and measures they can take to mitigate the risk. Nowadays, flood maps are considered to be a potentially valuable tool for improving this understanding, but some drawbacks related to the use of flood maps for risk communication has been highlighted in the literature. An alternative and novel approach is provided by 3-D representations of flood inundation, so that supplementing flood maps with 3D visualization techniques is increasingly seen as a powerful tool with which to engage people with flood hazards. In this context, the detailed representation of the urban areas is important not only to set an accurate out-of-bank river model, essential for reliable simulations of flow dynamics inside the urban districts, but could be also a key element for the generation of realistic 3D views able to enhance risk perception and communication. In the framework described so far, 3D point cloud data provided by a terrestrial laser scanner could play an interesting role. Therefore, the main novelty introduced by this work is the combination of 2D flood simulations, 3D visual techniques and airborne/terrestrial laser scanning in order to develop new approaches for risk communication and perceptions. The potential of the methods developed here has been discussed in relation to a hypothetical flood event of the Crati river, flowing through the old city of Cosenza (South of Italy).}

The focus is on interventional approaches that seek to improve evacuation efficiency rather than efforts to purely describe/predict evacuations. Three major evacuation optimisation approaches are identified: (a) architectural design and infrastructure adjustment, (b) mathematical programming and optimisation of path/departure-schedule planning, (c) behavioural modification, training and active instructions. The reviewed literature is dominated by architectural solutions, while the evidence on their effectiveness is largely mixed and inconclusive. They also pose practical challenges: major design interventions in previously-built infrastructure may not always be readily feasible. Furthermore, the effectiveness of architectural solutions is often suggested to be geometry/context dependant rather than universal. Complex path/schedule optimisation solutions also pose their own implementation and enforcement challenges. They often require that an entire crowd be controlled and directed by a central body. They also do not address microscopic aspects of individual behaviour. The behavioural modification method used to be the least studied approach until recently, but it is gaining increasing traction as a promising method in terms of both effectiveness and practicality. Its underexplored potential constitutes a major knowledge gap in evacuation dynamics literature. The first important step to address this gap is to (i) identify possible and most effective areas of behavioural intervention; and (ii) employ reliable experimental or numerical methods to discover optimum strategies, and (iii) determine how behavioural interventions can be effectively conveyed to people. Establishing the relative effectiveness of the three optimisation approaches also constitutes another important question to be explored.}

Pedestrians' head-turning behaviors are crucial to navigating streets safely. This research investigates the effects of phone use on pedestrians' street-crossing behaviors at an uncontrolled intersection where head-turning performances are important to identify a gap among the oncoming traffic. A field study using video cameras was conducted for evaluating pedestrians' head-turning behaviors (e.g., head-turning frequency, not looking at traffic before crossing, looking at the wrong traffic side), crossing time, and sudden movement while they were engaging in various smartphone activities (e.g., calling, texting, gaming, and listening to music). Data such as phone features, distraction types, and personal attributes of the pedestrians were obtained in the interviews conducted after pedestrians had completed crossing the street. The results indicate that the unsafe crossing behaviors (e.g., sudden movement, fewer head-turning frequencies, not looking at traffic before crossing, not looking at left side of traffic first) were more prevalent among those gaming with “Pokemon Go.” Web surfing appears to be the 2nd risky distraction event following gaming with “Pokemon Go.” Logistic regression models reveal several important correlates of unsafe crossing behaviors: being a student, large phone screen (5 in. or larger), and having un-restricted 4G Internet data allowance. The current research recommends that “Pokemon Go” gaming be prohibited while crossing the street.}

Mechanical deformation of human skin provides essential information about human motions, muscle stretching, vocal fold vibration, and heart rates.

Herein, we report a wearable wide-range strain sensor based on conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). A bioinspired bilayer structure was constructed to enable wide-range strain sensing (1%–100%). Besides, hydrogel was chosen as the biological- and mechanical-compatible interface layer with the human skin. Finally, we demonstrated that the strain sensor is capable of monitoring various strain-related activities, including subtle skin deformation (pulse and phonation), mid-level body stretch (swallowing and facial expressions), and substantial joint movement (elbow bending).}

This paper investigates the effects of several smartphone distracting activities (gaming, talking, texting, Web surfing, and listening to music) on the street-crossing behaviours of pedestrians in Taipei City, Taiwan. A field study using video cameras was conducted to observe pedestrian crossing behaviours (e.g., crossing time, sudden movements, running a red light, and walking outside the crosswalk) at a selected signalised intersection. Data such as phone features, distracting activities, and personal attributes of the pedestrians were obtained in interviews conducted after pedestrians had completed crossing the street. In total, 1995 pedestrians engaging in various smartphone activities were observed. Results indicate that unsafe crossing behaviours were more prevalent among those playing “Pokemon Go”. Texting via instant-message apps appeared to be the second-most risk distracting activity. Results of the logistic models reveal that contributing factors to unsafe behaviours include being a student, phone screen of 5 in. or larger, and having an unrestricted 4G Internet data allowance. Two interaction terms (gaming × students, and gaming × unlimited 4G data allowance) in the models appear to be important determinants of unsafe crossing behaviours. The current research suggests that to prevent potential crashes and injuries, smartphone gaming while crossing the street should be prohibited.}

The purpose of this study is to explore a methodological approach of assessing tourist preference of STA, and the strengths and weaknesses of an STA accordingly. First, factor analysis was used to determine tourists' key evaluation items of STA. Next, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and analytic hierarchy process were applied to the STA evaluation of Hongshan Zoo, a popular tourist attraction in China. Then, importance-performance analysis was conducted to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of Hongshan Zoo's STA construction. Findings suggest that “smart information system”, “intelligent tourism management”, “smart sightseeing”, “e-commerce system”, “smart safety”, “intelligent traffic”, “smart forecasting” and “virtual tourist attractions” are tourists' key evaluation factors of STA. This paper extends previous research on smart tourism, and offers insights into the theoretical investigation and practical development of STA.}

abstract = {A fire can have serious economic and human consequences. However, in many cases, rapid intervention and appropriate behavior can significantly reduce this threat. For this it is important that people are properly trained. Faced with the economic, ecological and organizational requirements and constraints linked to fire safety training, virtual training environments appear to be a judicious alternative to traditional training. However, before committing companies to invest in expensive devices, it is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such devices. The literature is rich and divided on this subject, and it appears that certain characteristics of the system and of the learners are decisive. In this context, the objective of our work was to study the effects of immersion, the feeling of presence as well as the interaction between these 2 factors on the performance of conceptual and procedural learning. Certain variables were also controlled such as gender, tendency to immersion, previous experience in computers and video games. Our work shows that immersion promotes procedural but not conceptual learning, and that neither the sense of presence, nor the interaction between immersion and the sense of presence affect these two types of learning in our training task. Apart from the knowledge of fire which potentiates the effect of immersion on procedural learning, the variables considered in our study (computer experience, video game experience and genre) had no impact on performance. Understanding the impact of the technical device or the characteristics of users on conceptual and procedural learning is a major challenge in helping trainers to develop pedagogical devices in order to better exploit the opportunities offered by new technological approaches.}

This phenomenal growth in useable technology and its proportionate decrease in price have benefited the applicability of VR which in turn, have made it more accessible for researchers wishing to harness its benefits. The last 10 years have seen a steady increase in the use of VR technology to restore, preserve, reconstruct, recreate, and visualise ancient sites, monuments and artefacts.

Acquiring the most accurate neural network inside a sensible run-time is a challenge. However, metaheuristics are the key to the success of the application of DL on IoT big data due to non-deterministic polynomial time (NP hard) problems in these areas. Many papers were published about metaheuristic in optimizing deep leaning models, but the literature lacks a study that precisely investigate the relationship between IoT, deep learning and metaheuristic.

We propose a light and wearable force feedback device that can measure finger motion without calibration and can implement different stiffnesses using a cable slack-based mechanism. The proposed system has a small weight of 298 g, using a 10 g motor. To measure finger motion without calibration, an equation for each finger joint angle is derived from the three-dimensional position and orientation information of the fingertip. To realize different stiffnesses, the proposed system connects a motor and a finger structure with a cable; zero impedance is realized by maintaining a slack. The adjustable cable slack mechanism ensures to restrict the finger motion when the fingertip touches the surface of a virtual object even in fast motion; different stiffnesses are realized by proportional control input to the motor according to the deformation of the virtual object. We manufactured a prototype for three fingers and experimentally verified the performance of the proposed system.}

We observe that in this context delivery workers provide the necessary resilience to the consumer market, yet owing to lack of risk awareness and low wages they may not have incentives to value and manage safety risks properly. We have therefore investigated public and market regulation for possible remedies for this problem. Our research concludes that delivery risks are currently overlooked in EU road transport regulations. Furthermore, the necessary sector transparency that would allow compliance control is equally missing. We have found that the parcel delivery and on-demand delivery sectors also do not provide any special safety measures. The companies do not go beyond recommendations and guidelines and indicate no compliance controls. Some solutions are offered by mandatory contract law, which could provide retailers and consumers with the tools needed to enforce safe delivery in the contract chain. Nevertheless, since there are no explicit contractual obligations, legal uncertainty remains. Our main recommendation is for greater transparency in B2C delivery chains with new or amended regulations, increased reporting obligations and market regulation. All these should be underpinned by optimising digitised data flows in contract chains, which can be achieved by a data pipeline connecting all stakeholders in the delivery chain.}

This paper1 presents HDy Copilot, an application for automatic accident detection integrated with multimodal alert dissemination, via both eCall and IEEE 802.11p (ITS-G5). The proposed accident detection algorithm receives inputs from the vehicle, via ODB-II, and from the smartphone sensors, namely the accelerometer, the magnetometer and the gyroscope. An Android smartphone is used as human machine interface, so that the driver can configure the application, receive road hazard warnings issued by other vehicles in the vicinity and cancel countdown procedures upon false road vehicle crash detection. The HDy Copilot is developed for Android OS as it provides open source APIs that allow access to its hardware resources. The application is implemented, tested and connected to an IEEE 802.11p based prototype. The generated results show that the application successfully detects collisions, rollovers, performs the eCall along with sending Minimum Set of Data (MSD) and Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM).}

abstract = {With the increasing complexity of modern buildings, it is becoming more challenging for the professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to effectively digest complex engineering and design information and develop an accurate spatial memory that is critical to their daily tasks. As emerging visualization technologies, such as Virtual Reality, are considered as a promising solution, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanism by which different information visualization methods affect AEC task performance. Cognition literature has discovered a strong relationship between attention and memory development, but little has been done to understand how the visual attention patterns during the design documents review affect the effectiveness of spatial memory in AEC tasks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 63) to test how spatial knowledge is acquired in a building inspection task and how the different visual attention patterns affect the development of spatial memory. Participants were asked to review the design information of a real building on campus. To trigger different attention patterns, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups based on the forms of information given in the review session, including 2D, 3D, and VR groups. After a brief review session, participants were asked to go to the real building to identify discrepancies (based on memory) that were intentionally inserted by the authors. The inspection performance was used to evaluate the spatial memory development. The results indicate that in general there is a positive relationship between test subjects’ visual attention (fixation time) and spatial memory, but the increasing rate varies across the three groups, suggesting that visual context plays a critical role in the development efficiency of spatial memory. The findings also indicate that the visual attention – spatial memory relationship may be mediated by the use of different spatial knowledge acquisition strategies. This study is expected to contribute to the construction information technology literature by setting the cornerstone of a cognition-driven information system that tailors into the spatial cognitive process of AEC professionals.}

Methods: A comprehensive search was undertaken from April 2020 to 22nd January 2021 using multiple electronic databases. A systematic review protocol was developed and published on PROSPERO registration; CRD42020181481. A random-effects model was used to compute pooled estimates of anxiety, depression, PTSD, insomnia and suicidal thoughts. Findings: Our search yielded 11,295 studies and of those 287 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of 206 studies revealed minimal differences in prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among HCPs compared with the public during the pandemic but higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts/ideation or self-harm (11% vs 5.8%) and lower prevalence of wellbeing (28.2% vs 52.6%) among the public compared to HCPs. Interpretation: The pandemic has led to a high mental health burden especially amongst HCPs and higher suicidal ideation and lower wellbeing in general public which warrants further investigation and management globally. These findings highlight an emerging critical public health issue that requires urgent solutions.}

Surprisingly, academic business literature has remained relatively silent on the immense potential of biometric data, as well as on the various dangers that come with its collection and usage. This article sets out to (1) detail what biometric data entails and how it may be used, (2) describe opportunities associated with using biometric data in various business applications, (3) discuss challenges related to biometric data collection and usage, privacy and security, storage and safety, and potential for reduced inclusiveness and enhanced biases, and (4) outline related directions for future research.}

abstract = {Privacy is one of the most important social and political issues in our information society, characterized by a growing range of enabling and supporting technologies and services. Amongst these are communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks, and audio–video surveillance. Each of these can potentially provide the means for privacy intrusion. De-identification is one of the main approaches to privacy protection in multimedia contents (text, still images, audio and video sequences and their combinations). It is a process for concealing or removing personal identifiers, or replacing them by surrogate personal identifiers in personal information in order to prevent the disclosure and use of data for purposes unrelated to the purpose for which the information was originally obtained. Based on the proposed taxonomy inspired by the Safe Harbour approach, the personal identifiers, i.e., the personal identifiable information, are classified as non-biometric, physiological and behavioural biometric, and soft biometric identifiers. In order to protect the privacy of an individual, all of the above identifiers will have to be de-identified in multimedia content. This paper presents a review of the concepts of privacy and the linkage among privacy, privacy protection, and the methods and technologies designed specifically for privacy protection in multimedia contents. The study provides an overview of de-identification approaches for non-biometric identifiers (text, hairstyle, dressing style, license plates), as well as for the physiological (face, fingerprint, iris, ear), behavioural (voice, gait, gesture) and soft-biometric (body silhouette, gender, age, race, tattoo) identifiers in multimedia documents.}

abstract = {Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

On-bike human–machine interfaces (HMIs) and connecting cyclists to AVs and the road infrastructure may have the potential to enhance the safety of cyclists. This study aimed to identify cyclists’ needs in today’s and future traffic, and explore on-bike HMI functionality and the implications of equipping cyclists with devices to communicate with AVs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 cyclists in Norway and 15 cyclists in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors of cyclist-AV interaction and on-bike HMIs. From the analysis, seven themes were identified: Interaction, Bicycles, Culture, Infrastructure, Legislation, AVs, and HMI. These themes are diverse and overlap with factors grouped in sub-themes. The results indicated that the cyclists prefer segregated future infrastructure, and in mixed urban traffic, they need confirmation of detection by AVs. External on-vehicle or on-bike HMIs might be solutions to fulfil the cyclists’ need for recognition. However, the analysis suggested that cyclists are hesitant about being equipped with devices to communicate with AVs: Responsibility for safety should lie with AV technology rather than with cyclists. A device requirement might become a barrier to cycling, as bicycles are traditionally cheap and simple, and additional costs might deter people from choosing cycling as a transport mode. Future studies should investigate user acceptance of on-bike HMIs among cyclists on a larger scale to test the findings’ generalisability, and explore other, perhaps more viable solutions than on-bike HMIs for enhancing AV-cyclist interaction.}

It allows for sharing a 5G infrastructure among different tenants leading to improved service customisation and increased operators’ revenues. Concurrently, introducing the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) into 5G to support time-critical applications raises the need to integrate this distributed computing infrastructure to the 5G network slicing framework. Indeed, end-to-end latency guarantees require the end-to-end management of slice resources. For this purpose, after discussing the main gaps in the state-of-the-art with regards to such an objective, we propose a novel slicing architecture that enables the management and orchestration of slice segments that span over all the domains of an end-to-end application service, including the MEC. We also show how this general management architecture can be instantiated into a multi-tenant MEC infrastructure. A preliminary implementation of the proposed architecture focusing on the MEC domain is also provided, together with performance tests to validate the feasibility and efficacy of our design approach.}

The authors selected the articles published in journals with an impact factor higher then 1.0, as well as the top 100 most cited articles. The search resulted on 381 articles, which were then categorised in order to systematise the research conducted over the years. The authors have not only analysed the existing literature but also highlighted new emerging fields in BIM research, being possible to identify Collaborative Environments and Interoperability, Sustainable Construction, BIM Adoption & Standardisation, and BIM Programming as the categories with the most significant growth in the last years. It was also observed that the most researched topics were related with the development of BIM tools, the study of BIM adoption worldwide, the energy simulation using BIM-based information and, more recently, with the semantic interoperability and ontology. On the other hand, the study on BIM at the academic level is very small, as well as parametric modelling and quantity take-off.}

From the overall perspective of the role and use of forensic science in the criminal justice system, the concepts of Forensic Information Value Added (FIVA) and Forensic Information Value Efficiency (FIVE) are introduced. From these concepts the key factors determining the added value of forensic investigations are discussed; Evidential Value, Relevance, Quality, Speed and Cost. By unravelling the added value of forensic science and combining this with the future needs and scientific and technological developments, six forensic grand challenges are introduced: i) Molecular Photo-fitting; ii) chemical imaging, profiling and age estimation of finger marks; iii) Advancing Forensic Medicine; iv) Objective Forensic Evaluation; v) the Digital Forensic Service Centre and vi) Real time In-Situ Chemical Identification. Finally, models for forensic innovation are presented that could lead to major international breakthroughs on all these six themes within a five year time span. This could cause a step change in the added value of forensic science and would make forensic investigative methods even more valuable than they already are today.}

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are considered key actors for helping realise a successful transition towards a greener and more equitable future, in a time and age where much hope is set on novel digital technologies (often termed Industry 4.0) to expedite change ‘for good’. Despite this attention, however, there is limited insight into the actual state of the art regarding MNEs, Industry 4.0 and the implications for sustainability. As a result, academic knowledge of how MNEs develop and employ digital technologies, and what significance this has in relation to sustainability, is fragmented along disciplinary boundaries. We therefore conduct a systemic multidisciplinary review of the literature, examining the different types of digital technologies, the geographical scope of the studies, and the sustainability dimensions covered. Based on this critical evaluation, which considers both (potential) positive and negative implications, we present a promising research agenda for scholars on themes that are also highly relevant for organizations, individuals, societies and the planet.}

abstract = {Background
The relatively decreased time spent in the operating room and overall reduction in cases performed by neurosurgical trainees as a result of duty-hour restrictions demands that the pedagogical content within each surgical encounter be maximized and crafted toward the specific talents and shortcomings of the individual. It is imperative to future generations that the quality of training adapts to the changing administrative infrastructures and compensates for anything that may compromise the technical abilities of trainees. Neurosurgeons in teaching hospitals continue to experiment with various emerging technologies—such as simulators and virtual presence—to supplement and improve surgical training.
Methods
The authors participated in the Google Glass Explorer Program in order to assess the applicability of Google Glass as a tool to enhance the operative education of neurosurgical residents. Google Glass is a type of wearable technology in the form of eyeglasses that employs a high-definition camera and allows the user to interact using voice commands.
Results
Google Glass was able to effectively capture video segments of various lengths for residents to review in a variety of clinical settings within a large, tertiary care university hospital, as well as during a surgical mission to a developing country. The resolution and quality of the video were adequate to review and use as a teaching tool.
Conclusion
While Google Glass harbors the potential to dramatically improve both neurosurgical education and practice in a variety of ways, certain technical drawbacks of the current model limit its effectiveness as a teaching tool.}
