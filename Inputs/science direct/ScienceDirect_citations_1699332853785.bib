With the continuously rising number of flights available, both domestically and internationally, it is conceivable that the number of IFMEs will similarly continue to rise. Although most of these instances are relatively self-limited, the rare instance of a severe occurrence justifies preparation, both from in-flight staff and healthcare providers traveling on these flights. Given these events' sporadic nature and the variable availability of medical support, all physicians need to understand their in-flight ethical and legal capabilities, the available medical supplies, and the most likely etiologies to manage such situations successfully. Most radiologists rarely utilize the hands-on, clinical skills developed in medical school or internship for emergencies beyond allergic contrast reactions. Therefore, they may not be adept in caring for patients during an IFME. As such, we present a thorough overview and literature review for the radiologist regarding the management of various acute IFMEs, with consideration for ethical and legal precedence and a review of medical equipment available on-board.}

abstract = {Risk prediction tools are crucial for population-based management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, most prediction models are currently used to assess long-term risk instead of the risk of short-term CVD onset. We developed a Dynamic Risk-based Early wArning Monitoring (DREAM) system using large-scale, real-time electronic health record data from 2010 to 2020 from the CHinese Electronic health Records Research in Yinzhou study. The dynamic risk scores were derived from a 1:5 matched nested case–control set comprising 70,470 individuals (11,745 CVD events) and then validated in a cohort of 81,205 individuals (5950 CVD events). The individuals were Chinese adults aged 40–79 years without a history of CVD at baseline. Eleven predictors related to vital signs, laboratory tests, and health service utilization were selected to establish the dynamic scores. The proposed scores were significantly associated with the subsequent CVD onset (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.23). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) was 0.6010 (0.5929–0.6092) and 0.6021 (0.5937–0.6105) for the long-term 10-year CVD risk <10% and ≥10% groups in the derivation set, respectively. In the long-term 10-year CVD risk ≥10% group in the validation set, the change in AUC in addition to the long-term risk was 0.0235 (0.0155–0.0315). By increasing the risk threshold from 7 to 16 points, the proportion of true subsequent CVD cases among those given alerts increased from 40.61% to 85.31%. In terms of management efficiency, the number needed to manage per CVD case ranged from 2.46 to 1.17 using the risk scores. With the increasing popularity and integration of EHR systems with wearable technology, the DREAM scores can be incorporated into an early-warning system and applied in dynamic, real-time, EHR-based, automated management to support healthcare decision making for individuals, general practitioners, and policymakers.}

This paper discusses the trends and challenges of smart wearables. Future wearable technology will be more compact and integrated.

This paper summarizes the research on the human body and environment based energy harvesting techniques, including solar, thermal, Radio frequency (RF) energy, kinetic energy, and biomass energy. We deeply analyze the application potential and limitations of each new energy harvesting technology and summarize the relationship between the energy required by wearables and the new energy harvesting systems. Solar and kinetic energy generation technologies have higher energy density and are suitable for application in outdoor sports wearables. RF energy, thermal energy, and biomass energy have less energy dense and can be used as auxiliary power sources for small wearables. The combination of the energy harvesting system and the micro energy storage unit enables the continuous power supply of wearables in different circumstances of daytime, nighttime, indoor and outdoor. The significance of this work stems from providing guidance for future energy supply methods of wearables.}

The effects of PPI and IPI on perceived attributes of wearable technology (relative advantage, social image, aesthetics, and novelty) are then examined, which influence purchase intention. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a survey data from young consumers. Structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate the proposed research model. Results demonstrate that 1) the DSI construct must be examined in the two dimensions so that it can properly measure the nature and characteristics of DSI, 2) IPI plays an important role, having a positive effect on all four perceived attributes of IT innovations, 3) PPI has a positive effect on perceived social image and perceived novelty, and finally 4) all perceived attributes of IT innovations have a positive effect on consumers’ purchase intention of wearable devices.

abstract = {Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a common event, affecting almost 400,000 individuals annually in North America. Initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using an automated external defibrillator (AED) are critical for survival, yet many bystanders are reluctant to intervene. Digital technologies, including mobile devices, social media, and crowdsourcing might help play a role to improve survival from SCA. In this article we review the current digital tools and strategies available to increase rates of bystander recognition of SCA, prompt immediate activation of emergency medical services (EMS), initiate high-quality CPR, and to locate, retrieve, and operate AEDs. Smartphones can help to educate and connect bystanders with EMS dispatchers, through text messaging or video calling, to encourage the initiation of CPR and retrieval of the closest AED. Wearable devices and household smart speakers could play a future role in continuous vital signs monitoring in individuals at risk of lethal arrhythmias and send an alert to either chosen contacts or EMS. Machine learning algorithms and mathematical modelling might aid EMS dispatchers with better recognition of SCA as well as policymakers with where to best place AEDs for optimal accessibility. There are challenges with the use of digital tech, including the need for government regulation and issues with data ownership, accessibility, and interoperability. Future research will include smart cities, e-linkages, new technologies, and using social media for mass education. Together or in combination, these emerging digital technologies might represent the next leap forward in SCA survival.
Résumé
L'arrêt cardiaque soudain (ACS) est un événement courant, qui touche près de 400 000 personnes chaque année en Amérique du Nord. La mise en place de la réanimation cardiorespiratoire (RCR) et de la défibrillation précoce à l'aide d'un défibrillateur externe automatisé (DEA) sont essentielles à la survie, mais de nombreux passants hésitent à intervenir. Les technologies numériques, notamment les appareils mobiles, les médias sociaux et la création participative pourraient contribuer à améliorer la survie après un ACS. Dans cet article, nous passons en revue les outils numériques actuels et les stratégies disponibles pour augmenter les taux d'identification d'un ACS par les passants, l'activation immédiate des services médicaux d'urgence (SMU), le déclenchement d'une RCR de qualité et la localisation, la récupération et le fonctionnement des DEA. Les téléphones intelligents peuvent contribuer à éduquer les témoins d'un ACS et à les mettre en relation avec les répartiteurs des SMU, par le biais de messages texte ou d'appels vidéo, afin d'encourager le déclenchement de la RCR et la récupération du DEA le plus proche. Les dispositifs portables et les haut-parleurs domestiques intelligents pourraient à l'avenir jouer un rôle dans la surveillance continue des signes vitaux chez les personnes présentant un risque d'arythmies mortelles et envoyer une alerte à des contacts prédéfinis ou aux SMU. Les algorithmes d'apprentissage automatique et la modélisation mathématique pourraient aider les répartiteurs des SMU à mieux reconnaître les ACS et les décideurs à déterminer où placer les DEA pour une accessibilité optimale. L'utilisation des technologies numériques présente des défis, notamment la nécessité d'une réglementation gouvernementale et des questions de propriété, d'accessibilité et d'interopérabilité des données. Les futures recherches porteront sur les villes intelligentes, les liens électroniques, les nouvelles technologies et l'utilisation des médias sociaux pour l'éducation de masse. Ensemble ou en combinaison, ces technologies numériques émergentes pourraient représenter le prochain bond en avant quant à la survie à un ACS.}

abstract = {Background
Early detection of atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) may enable prevention of downstream morbidity. Consumer wrist-worn wearable technology is capable of detecting AF by identifying irregular pulse waveforms using photoplethysmography (PPG). The validity of PPG-based software algorithms for AF detection requires prospective assessment.
Methods
The Fitbit Heart Study (NCT04380415) is a single-arm remote clinical trial examining the validity of a novel PPG-based software algorithm for detecting AF. The proprietary Fitbit algorithm examines pulse waveform intervals during analyzable periods in which participants are sufficiently stationary. Fitbit consumers with compatible wrist-worn trackers or smartwatches were invited to participate. Enrollment began May 6, 2020 and as of October 1, 2020, 455,699 participants enrolled. Participants in whom an irregular heart rhythm was detected were invited to attend a telehealth visit and eligible participants were then mailed a one-week single lead electrocardiographic (ECG) patch monitor. The primary study objective is to assess the positive predictive value of an irregular heart rhythm detection for AF during the ECG patch monitor period. Additional objectives will examine the validity of irregular pulse tachograms during subsequent heart rhythm detections, self-reported AF diagnoses and treatments, and relations between irregular heart rhythm detections and AF episode duration and time spent in AF.
Conclusions
The Fitbit Heart Study is a large-scale remote clinical trial comprising a unique software algorithm for detection of AF. The study results will provide critical insights into the use of consumer wearable technology for AF detection, and for characterizing the nature of AF episodes detected using consumer-based PPG technology.}

Digital forensics experts face a daunting task of handling these cyberattacks because of the unique and complex challenges posed by IoT. Recently, researchers have been drawn to finding solutions to these challenges, however, this is still in its infancy. This paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the current research advancements in IoT forensics. We define key IoT fundamentals, IoT applications, the need for IoT forensics, identify the key factors affecting IoT forensics, and review the practicality of the available IoT forensics frameworks, models, and methodologies. The SLR reveals research gaps indicating that most of the current research is more theoretical than practical. There is a need for more practical approaches to tackle the unique IoT forensics challenges. Finally, for future research directions from the SLR, we have highlighted and discussed the open challenges and requirements for IoT forensics.}

That ‘perfect storm’ exacerbates the risk of occupational heat illness, yet first responders must perform physically demanding work wearing personal-protective clothing and equipment. Unfortunately, the Eurocentric emphasis of past research has sometimes reduced its applicability to other ethnic groups. To redress that imbalance, relevant contemporary research has been reviewed, to which has been added information applicable to people of Asian, Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry. An epidemiological triad is used to identify the causal agents and host factors of work intolerance within hot-humid climates, commencing with the size dependency of resting metabolism and heat production accompanying load carriage, followed by a progression from the impact of single-layered clothing through to encapsulating ensembles. A morphological hypothesis is presented to account for inter-individual differences in heat production and heat loss, which seems to explain apparent ethnic- and gender-related differences in thermoregulation, at least within thermally compensable states. The mechanisms underlying work intolerance, cardiovascular insufficiency and heat illness are reviewed, along with epidemiological data from the Asia-Pacific. Finally, evidence-based preventative and treatment strategies are presented and updated concerning moisture-management fabrics and barriers, dehydration, pre- and post-exercise cooling, and heat adaptation. An extensive reference list is provided, with >25 recommendations enabling physiologists, occupational health specialists, policy makers, purchasing officers and manufacturers to rapidly extract interpretative outcomes pertinent to the Asia-Pacific.}

Laypeople should be trained in basic life support and traditional and innovative methodologies may help to obtain this goal. However, there is a knowledge gap about the ideal basic life support training methods. Smart glasses could have a role facilitating laypeople learning of basic life support.
Aim
To analyze the potential impact on basic life support learning of a very brief training supported by smart glasses video communication.
Methods
Twelve laypeople were basic life support tele-trained by means of smart glasses by an instructor in this pilot study. During training (assisted trough smart glasses) and after the training (unassisted) participants’ performance and quality of basic life support and automated external defibrillation procedure were assessed on a standardized simulated scenario.
Results
After the training all participants were able to deliver good quality basic life support, with results comparable to those obtained when real time remotely guided by the instructor through the smart glasses. Mean chest compression rate was significantly higher when not guided (113 /min vs. 103 /min, p = 0.001). When not assisted, the participants spent less time delivering the sequential basic life support steps than when assisted while training.
Conclusions
A very brief remote training supported by instructor and smart glasses seems to be an effective educational method that could facilitate basic life support learning by laypeople. This technology could be considered in cases where instructors are not locally available or in general in remote areas, providing basic internet connection is available. Smart glasses could also be useful for laypeople rolling-refreshers.}

Recently, owing to the progress in nanotechnologies and material sciences, novel fibers and textiles with desirable properties (radiation, thermal, wettability, etc.) have been extensively explored. Classifying and analyzing diverse PTM technologies, this work provides an overview on the human body thermoregulatory system, advantages and disadvantages of various technologies, and more importantly, the evaluation criteria of different technologies in terms of their energy saving and thermal comfort improving performances. Currently, PTM technologies have the potential to achieve 15–30% energy saving in buildings. However, further investigations on PTM technologies are needed, such as evaluation of thermal comfort for novel wearable textiles, and development of other performance indices for wearable PTM technologies including washability and permeability.}

While adopted for their convenience outside of the healthcare sector, these invasive, semi-permanent implantable devices create augmented bodies that can be subject to ubiquitous surveillance. Situating human microchip implantations within surveillance literature, we draw from neoliberal perspectives of surveillance to examine augmented bodies, particularly as sources for market activity and as subjects of social control and sorting when these bodies are used as access control mechanisms, payment methods, and tracking means in employment, residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. History has demonstrated time and time again how unfettered technology applications and uses have led to real and/or perceived misuse by private and public sectors. Through the lens of function creep, we identify a pattern of expansion of applications and uses of technology beyond those originally intended across new technologies, such as DNA genetic genealogy databases, IoT wearables, and COVID-19 contact tracing apps, and provide illustrative examples of function creep, particularly the use of these technologies in criminal investigations and prosecutions despite not being intended or marketed for such use. By demonstrating the lack of clearly defined boundaries in the applications and uses of various new technologies and their associated data, and the ways they were misused, we demonstrate how human microchip implantations are headed on a similar path. The current and potential future uses of this technology raise concerns about the absence of regulation, law, and policy barring or limiting its application and use in specific sectors, and the impact of this technology on users’ security, data protection, and privacy. Undeniably, the present and potential future functions, applications, uses, and extensions of human microchip implantations in various sectors warrant a proactive examination of their security, privacy, and data protection consequences and the implementation of proactive policies to regulate new and currently unregulated uses of this technology and its associated data within these sectors.}

abstract = {Objectives
We sought to explore the accuracy of remote chest X-ray reading using hands-free, wearable technology (Google Glass, Google, Mountain View, California).
Methods
We compared interpretation of twelve chest X-rays with 23 major cardiopulmonary findings by faculty and fellows from cardiology, radiology, and pulmonary-critical care via: (1) viewing the chest X-ray image on the Google Glass screen; (2) viewing a photograph of the chest X-ray taken using Google Glass and interpreted on a mobile device; (3) viewing the original chest X-ray on a desktop computer screen. One point was given for identification of each correct finding and a subjective rating of user experience was recorded.
Results
Fifteen physicians (5 faculty and 10 fellows) participated. The average chest X-ray reading score (maximum 23 points) as viewed through the Google Glass, Google Glass photograph on a mobile device, and the original X-ray viewed on a desktop computer was 14.1±2.2, 18.5±1.5 and 21.3±1.7, respectively (p<0.0001 between Google Glass and mobile device, p<0.0001 between Google Glass and desktop computer and p=0.0004 between mobile device and desktop computer). Of 15 physicians, 11 (73.3%) felt confident in detecting findings using the photograph taken by Google Glass as viewed on a mobile device.
Conclusion
Remote chest X-ray interpretation using hands-free, wearable technology (Google Glass) is less accurate than interpretation using a desktop computer or a mobile device, suggesting that further technical improvements are needed before widespread application of this novel technology.}

Deep Learning (DL), blockchain and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), three of the most revolutionary technologies, have aided replace conventional practice employed in the healthcare industry with more sophisticated and efficient procedures. In this research, we propose DON-B-STRESSED (DBS), an innovative framework which integrates DL, blockchain and IoMT technologies to provide a method for the early detection of stress in users donning IoMT devices. Long-term stress, indeed, is well-known to have profound consequences on human wellbeing; hence the need for automated solutions for continual stress monitoring. DON-B-STRESSED stands for DON a Blockchain-based, Secure, Timely, REliable System for StrEss Detection: the premise behind this is that if the above-mentioned technologies can be combined, a system that employs IoMT for users' data collection, DL to properly predict patients' stress levels, and smart contracts deployed on blockchain to ensure secure transactions and health checks, the well-known concerns of harmful effects of long-term stress might be avoided. By using multimodal data from both a chest- and a wrist-worn IoMT device, we have developed a tailored, secure, accurate yet fast real-time system for the early detection of stress signs. The DL part has been evaluated on WESAD, a publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection, reaching an accuracy of more than 99% with LOSO generalization scheme. Furthermore, the scalability and reliability of DON-B-STRESSED are shown by comparison with the findings of past research.}

As the adoption of wearable devices spreads, there are cultural and social impacts that represent both barriers and opportunities, with subsequent policy ramifications. All too often designers, technologists, and policymakers operate independently developing products that are out of sync, lack interoperability, or are hindered by well meaning, but obstructive policy. This paper proposes a futures-based, iterative policy-informed design framework for developing wearable devices that guides interdisciplinary collaborators early in the process of designing a research & development plan. This approach allows for the development of “images of the future” through which various potential implications and effects of device design in social, technological, and regulatory contexts can be explored.}

Wearable extractive devices are promising tools that are present in the analytical toolbox and address the abovementioned needs. These devices consist of a particular class of samplers that an individual can wear without limiting her/his daily life activities. In addition to being wearable, these devices show the ability to preconcentrate the analytes in an extractive phase while integrating the sampling and sample preparation. In addition to being imperative for personal exposure investigations, applications in diagnostic and prognostic health monitoring are among their emerging applications. Besides, in vivo soft samplers based on microextraction techniques provide non-invasive to low invasive approaches for non-lethal monitoring of various biosystems. Although in these applications they are not used in an ‘obvious way’ as wearable devices as they are not placed directly on the subject's skin and are instead immersed under the skin, in the scope of this review they will still be considered to provide a picture for future directions of extractive wearable devices. This review aims to cover the wearable extractive devices used in exposure studies (with a special focus on the last two years), in vivo, and in situ applications (with a focus on the last five years) where reliable information about the system is under interest.}

Endowing a robotic system with vision and tactile capabilities, similar to those of medical professionals, and thus enabling robots to assess a patient’s status in an emergency is a highly sought after characteristic in healthcare robotics. This paper presents a novel fuzzy triage system exploiting visual and tactile sensing, to equip a robot with the skills to accurately determine key vital signs in humans. There are three key signs of human health: respiratory rate, pulse rate (Beats Per Minute (BPM)) and capillary refill time. Using ground truth from a medical professional, the fuzzy triage system is trained and validated initially with informed synthetic data and then further evaluated using vital signs data collected from subjects in a pilot study. Results from this pilot study indicate that the fuzzy triage system is capable of classifying a patient’s health using the novel approaches for collecting BPM, Respiratory Rate (RR) and Capillary Refill Time (CRT) which replicate, to some extent, the approaches used by medical professionals for measuring vital signs. Furthermore, the intelligent system proved capable of determining whether a pulse was regular or arrhythmic, whether respiratory rate was regular or irregular, and determining the subject’s capillary refill time. Such results imply that this system could ultimately be used, for example, in a home assistance robot for elderly or disabled persons, or as a first responder robot. Ultimately the aim would be that these methods could be utilised by robotic systems in emergency scenarios or disaster zones.}

For self-report, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), as implemented on contemporary smartphones or personal digital assistants, can provide researchers with near-real-time information on participants' behavior and mood in their natural environments. Data from portable/wearable electronic sensors measuring participants' internal and external environments can be combined with EMA (e.g., by timestamps recorded on questionnaires) to provide objective information useful in determining the momentary context of behavior and mood and/or validating participants' self-reports. Here, we review three objective ambulatory monitoring techniques that have been combined with EMA, with a focus on detecting drug use and/or measuring the behavioral or physiological correlates of mental events (i.e., emotions, cognitions): (1) collection and processing of biological samples in the field to measure drug use or participants' physiological activity (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity); (2) global positioning system (GPS) location information to link environmental characteristics (disorder/disadvantage, retail drug outlets) to drug use and affect; (3) ambulatory electronic physiological monitoring (e.g., electrocardiography) to detect drug use and mental events, as advances in machine learning algorithms make it possible to distinguish target changes from confounds (e.g., physical activity). Finally, we consider several other mobile/wearable technologies that hold promise to be combined with EMA, as well as potential challenges faced by researchers working with multiple mobile/wearable technologies simultaneously in the field.}

It is unclear how well first responders recognize the need to seize digital evidence associated with fatal vehicles accidents in the field. This study addressed this gap in the literature by examining a comparative population of respondents from the state police agencies in a large Midwestern and large Southern state. Using a vignette design, the findings demonstrated that respondents recognized the need to recover mobile devices and telematics from the vehicles involved in fatal crashes. A substantive number of officers remained unsure of the potential digital evidentiary value of other objects on-scene (e.g., fast food, makeup). Further, regional differences were observed in respondents’ responses. The implications for our understanding of police capacity and training needs were explored in detail.}

In these regions, the rapid adoption and development of IoT produce a large amount of evidence. For instance, IoT devices such as cameras capture the different facial emotions of drivers in Autonomous driving systems. In completely autonomous vehicles, drivers have trouble in takeover transfers as they become disconnected from the actual aspect of driving. Factors affecting takeover effectiveness, such as lead time and the participation of non-driving-related tasks, have been concentrated. Nevertheless, considering the vital role of emotions, human communication and manual driving affect drivers' takeover efficiency. Face identity is essential for emotional sensitivity detection for drivers in autonomous vehicles. Automated and intelligent face recognition (FR) devices are highly accurate in a comfortable condition and unregulated, with poor reliability in autonomous vehicles. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly perceive and express feelings in well-being and similar fields. This study suggests an optimized IoT architecture that facilitates the physiological signal with wireless transmission to the database management center. Face Recognition and Emotion Detection based on IoT (FRED-IoT) has been proposed to track drivers' emotional and face recognition in autonomous vehicles. A low delay of 2 milliseconds is achieved in the proposed IoT Protocols. In contrast with cutting-edge technology, FRED-IoT improves reliability and achieves a high rating (F-score) of 96%.}

Twenty subjects (Females, n = 4; Males, n = 16; Height: 179.96 ± 8.66 cm; Weight: 94.99 ± 22.37 kg; Age: 36.95 ± 10.63 years) who were all active-duty law enforcement officers (LEOs) with 13.52 ± 11.23 years of LEO experience were recruited to participate in the study. Each subject completed two trials of the knife motions while wearing wearable motion sensors (ADPM) and recorded with a high-speed camera (GoPro) while using a training knife (Cold Steel).
Results
The time to complete the motions were: Thrust, 0.61 ± 0.15 s; Overhead, 0.68 ± 0.14 s; Figure 8, 1.07 ± 0.21 s; and Reverse, 0.62 ± 0.11 s. The Figure 8 motion was significantly slower than the other three motions: F (3, 57) = 101.19, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.84. The reliability analysis reported trivial variability and a high level of agreement: Thrust, ICCα = 0.701, SEM = 0.09 s, CV% = 15.02; Overhead, ICCα = 0.878, SEM = 0.05 s, CV% = 6.93; Figure 8, ICCα = 0.906, SEM = 0.07 s, CV% = 6.25, Reverse, ICCα = 0.420, SEM = 0.10 s, CV% = 17.31.
Discussion
Most LEOs or civilians within striking distance of someone with a knife may not be able to avoid contact from the knife attacks based on the speed knife attacks could occur.
Conclusion
The reference data provides pertinent information to update evidence-based training approaches to knife attack preparation and defense.}

Promoting and implementing 5G smart healthcare can reduce inconsistencies in allocating medical resources and expedite medical advancements. This article studied the 5G and its need in healthcare. Smart Principal Features and Serviceable Pillars of 5G Technology for healthcare are discussed briefly. Finally, identify and discuss significant applications of 5G for healthcare. 5G promises to give people more control over their health. With the implementation of 5G, we will most certainly witness the introduction of new medical technology, allowing patients to test and monitor their health from the comfort of their homes. The combination of 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will result in a network of smart devices that connect and, as a result, will broaden the backdrop for decision-making. It also creates new potential for the growth of the internal medical ecosystem. 5G network connection and coverage may be limited in areas with tall and broad trees and buildings. In the future, network operators and medical device makers will collaborate more in smart medical care.}

The lack of predictive safety systems that notify workers of upcoming dangers in advance is a major reason to blame in the highway maintenance and operation community. This article presents an integrative design framework for bringing recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the safety of highway workers through real-time multimodal notifications on-spot. To this end, this article conceptualizes and co-designs three major pillars: (1) AR user interface design for multimodal notification, (2) real-time AI at the edge for vehicle detection/classification from distance, and (3) real-time wireless communication in work zone setting to enable latency-aware operation between AI and AR components. Our early results demonstrate that we can achieve 24.83 FPS end-to-end execution latency on the Xavier AGX Jetson board with 48.7% mAP on BDD100K dataset, and a real-time communication covering 120 meters with an average latency of 5.1 ms at the farthest distance. Our mixed-method user research also reveals an acceptable level of excitement and engagement from the body of highway workers toward both the proposed technology and the designed user interface. Overall, this article provides a proof-of-concept toward AI-enabled AR safety systems in highway work zones.}

abstract = {Background
The Styrd Power Meter is gaining special interest for on-field gait analyses due to its low-cost and general availability. However, the reliability and validity of the Stryd during walking on positive slopes using different backpack loads have never been investigated.
Research question
Is the Stryd Power Meter reliable and valid for quantifying gait mechanics during walking on positive inclines and during level walking incorporating load carriage?
Methods
Seventeen participants from a police force rescue team performed 8 submaximal walking trials for 5-min at 3.6 km·h−1 during different positive slope (1%, 10% and 20%) and backpack load (0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of body mass) conditions. Two Stryd devices were utilized for reliability analyses. Validity of cadence and ground contact time (GCT) were analyzed against a gold standard device (Optojump).
Results
The Stryd demonstrated acceptable reliability [mean bias: < 2.5%; effect size (ES): < 0.25; standard error of the mean: < 1.7%; r: > 0.76] for power, cadence, and GCT. Validity measures (mean bias: <0.8%; ES: <0.07; r: >0.96; Lin’s Concordance Coefficient: 0.96; Mean Absolute Percent Error: <1%) for cadence were also found to be acceptable. The Stryd overestimated (P < 0.001; ES: >5.1) GCT in all the walking conditions. A significant systematic positive bias (P < 0.022; r = 0.56–0.76) was found in 7 conditions. Significance: The Stryd Power Meter appears to produce reliable measurements for power output, cadence and GCT. The Stryd produced valid measurements for cadence during walking on positive slopes and during level walking with a loaded backpack. However, the Stryd is not valid for measuring GCT during these walking conditions. This study adds novel data regarding the reliability and validity of this device and might be of particular interest for scientists, practitioners, and first responders seeking reliable devices to quantify gait mechanics during walking.}

ED crowding is a public health crisis, limiting quality and access to lifesaving care. The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the feasibility of radio-frequency identification tags to measure clinician-patient contact and (2) to test the relationship between ED occupancy and clinician-patient contact time.
Methods
In this 4-week observational study, radio-frequency identification tags were worn by emergency clinicians in a 21-bay urban teaching hospital emergency department. The time-motion data were merged with electronic medical repository patient information (N = 3,237) to adjust for occupancy, age, gender, and acuity. Qualitative themes were generated from focus group (N = 39) debriefings of the quantitative results.
Results
Data were collected on 56,342 total clinician events. Adjusting for patient age, increasing ED occupancy increased the number of times the attending physician entered and left the patient room (b = 0 .008, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.001-0.016], P = 0.03). There was no relationship for patient gender, triage acuity, shift at arrival, disposition to home, or discharge diagnosis category with either total minutes or number of encounters per patient visit. No time-motion and occupancy associations were observed for nurses, residents, or nurse practitioners/physician assistants. Debriefings indicated occupancy influenced the quality of care, despite maintaining the same quantity of contact time.
Discussion
The physical environment and clinician privacy concerns limit the feasibility of wearable tracking technology in the emergency setting. Attending physician care becomes more fragmented with increasing ED occupancy. Other clinicians report changes in the quality of care, whereas the quantity of time and encounters were unchanged with occupancy rates.Unlabelled BoxContribution to Emergency Nursing Practice•The current state of scientific knowledge on clinical-patient contact time indicates ED crowding may be detrimental to the quality, quantity, and consistency of care.•The main findings of this research include the following: As occupancy increases, we did not observe differences in time and motion for nurses and nurse practitioners/physician assistants, and we found that attending-physician care becomes more fragmented. There are several physical, architectural barriers to deploying radio-frequency identification tags in the emergency setting. Participating clinicians relayed several qualitative benefits and drawbacks to wearable tracking technology.•Key implications for emergency nursing practice indicate that additional revisions and considerations are needed to enhance wearable tracker feasibility for emergency clinicians.}

Fixed infrastructures, such as cell towers or radio base stations, may be completely destroyed during a disaster or this infrastructure may never have existed. In a disaster situation, having unreliable communications systems can put a relief personnel's safety at risk as well as make the effort much less effective. Furthermore, emergency situations require time-sensitive communications that could mean the difference between life and death. The communications system described in this paper provides a rapidly deployable, data-centric mobile communications system for all organizations engaged in disaster relief: first responders, search-and-rescue, emergency medical and health services, etc. Utilizing the IEEE 802.11b/g standard, this system creates a mobile wireless local area network through a series of “wearable routers”. The routers provide local Wi-Fi access to all users within of their respective ranges, and then all of these routers are connected to each other through an ultra-high-frequency backhaul network. Ultimately, from the user's perspective the network appears to be a standard Wi-Fi network with enhanced range. The purpose of this network is to provide communications between both local and widespread users until more traditional communications systems are restored. A proof-of-concept prototype using commercial-off-the-shelf components has been realized, and the real-world performance of the system has been characterized in Boston, MA and Pittsburgh, PA. The results show that this system provides a viable solution, but requires further attention to antenna design and in-band interference.}

We examined the impact of performing a cognitive task of varying loads and kayaking simultaneously, compared to performance on the same tasks individually.
Background
When two tasks are performed together, performance often suffers compared to performance on either task alone. Interference not only occurs in competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found with certain physically demanding activities, such as climbing.
Method
Skilled kayakers performed a kayak course on open water, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the kayak and counting tasks simultaneously.
Results
Despite some past research finding dual task facilitation with laboratory aerobic activities, simultaneous kayaking and tone counting led to dual-task interference.
Conclusion
Concurrent counting and kayaking led to performance impairments in both tasks, relative to single task performance.
Application
The present results are applicable to occupations involving concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance, such as the work of first responders and military operators.
Précis
Kayaking, like climbing, appears to hinder cognitive performance more than the low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

keywords = {Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, Response time, Public health, Emergency medical services},
abstract = {Background
Although several Utstein variables are known to independently improve survival, how they moderate the effect of emergency medical service (EMS) response times on survival is unknown.
Objectives
To quantify how public location, witnessed status, bystander CPR, and bystander AED shock individually and jointly moderate the effect of EMS response time delays on OHCA survival.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study was a secondary analysis of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epistry-Cardiac Arrest database (December 2005 to June 2015). We included all adult, non-traumatic, non-EMS witnessed, and EMS-treated OHCAs from eleven sites across the US and Canada. We trained a logistic regression model with standard Utstein control variables and interaction terms between EMS response time and the four aforementioned OHCA characteristics.
Results
102,216 patients were included. Three of the four characteristics – witnessed OHCAs (OR = 0.962), bystander CPR (OR = 0.968) and public location (OR = 0.980) – increased the negative effect of a one-minute delay on the odds of survival. In contrast, a bystander AED shock decreased the negative effect of a one-minute response time delay on the odds of survival (OR = 1.064). The magnitude of the effect of a one-minute delay in EMS response time on the odds of survival ranged from 1.3% to 9.8% (average: 5.3%), depending on the underlying OHCA characteristics.
Conclusions
Delays in EMS response time had the largest reduction in survival odds for OHCAs that did not receive a bystander AED shock but were witnessed, occurred in public, and/or received bystander CPR. A bystander AED shock appears to be protective against a delay in EMS response time.}

We explore the diverse implementations for improving the cooling and warming performance from fibers and yarns to fabrics and the latest wearable technologies.

We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance.
Background
Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity.
Method
Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone.
Results
In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate.
Conclusion
Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance.
Application
The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance.
Précis
High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

Recently, the breakthroughs of Industry 4.0 have allowed for tracking worker conditions. Based on these, various analytical models have been performed with the aim of guiding work design in occupational environments, which contributes to ultimately achieving a safe and productive Operator 4.0. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and implementation guidelines. In this paper, we review the literature on upper-limb fatigue modeling in occupational settings, since it is reported shoulder injuries are a pressing issue. From the reviewed papers, our main observations are that the majority of studies focus on identifying human fatigue/reliability indices, and the corresponding factors contributing to these indices, through statistical and biomechanical models. However, existing models lack the consideration of several important aspects of upper-limb fatigue analysis, such as the full use of wearable sensor data in a real-time manner, consideration of the heterogeneity of workers and measurement devices, and the difference between simulated and actual work environment. Moreover, the issue of fatigue development for the workers' upper extremities, which could significantly have an impact on workers' performance, has not yet been studied from a system reliability point of view to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Reliability engineering models that are widely used to model machines can play an important role in modeling humans in occupational settings. We discuss the limitations of the reviewed articles and provide insights for future research.}

abstract = {Aim
To determine long-term survival of patients after cardiac arrest undergoing emergent coronary angiography and therapeutic hypothermia.
Methods
We analysed data from patients treated within the regional STEMI Network from January 2015 to December 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at median follow-up. Secondary endpoints were periprocedural complications (arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, mechanical complication, stent thrombosis, reinfarction, bleeding) and 6-month all-cause death. A landmark analysis was performed, studying two time periods; 0–6 months and beyond 6 months.
Results
From a total of 24,125 patients in the regional STEMI network, 494 patients who suffered from cardiac arrest were included and divided into two groups: treated with (n = 119) and without therapeutic hypothermia (n = 375). At median follow−up (16.0 [0.2–33.3] months), there was no difference in the adjusted mortality rate between groups (51.3 % with hypothermia vs 48.0 % without hypothermia; HRadj1.08 95%CI [0.77–1.53]; p = 0.659). There was a higher frequency of bleeding in the hypothermia group (6.7 % vs 1.1 %; ORadj 7.99 95%CI [2.05–31.2]; p = 0.002), without difference for the rest of periprocedural complications. At 6-month follow−up, adjusted all-cause mortality rate was similar between groups (46.2 % with hypothermia vs 44.5 % without hypothermia; HRadj1.02 95%CI [0.71–1.47]; p = 0.900). Also, no differences were observed in the adjusted mortality rate between 6 months and median follow−up (9.4 % with hypothermia vs 6.3 % without hypothermia; HRadj2.02 95%CI [0.69–5.92]; p = 0.200).
Conclusions
In a large cohort of patients with cardiac arrest within a regional STEMI network, those treated with therapeutic hypothermia did not improve long−term survival compared to those without hypothermia.}

Wearable devices have made it easier to generate and share data collected on individuals. This systematic review seeks to investigate whether deidentifying data from wearable devices is sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals in datasets. We searched Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PubMed, Scopus, and the ACM Digital Library on Dec 6, 2021 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42022312922). We also performed manual searches in journals of interest until April 12, 2022. Although our search strategy had no language restrictions, all retrieved studies were in English. We included studies showing reidentification, identification, or authentication with data from wearable devices. Our search retrieved 17 625 studies, and 72 studies met our inclusion criteria. We designed a custom assessment tool for study quality and risk of bias assessments. 64 studies were classified as high quality and eight as moderate quality, and we did not detect any bias in any of the included studies. Correct identification rates were typically 86–100%, indicating a high risk of reidentification. Additionally, as little as 1–300 s of recording were required to enable reidentification from sensors that are generally not thought to generate identifiable information, such as electrocardiograms. These findings call for concerted efforts to rethink methods for data sharing to promote advances in research innovation while preventing the loss of individual privacy.}

Achieving multifunctionality on textiles is a key milestone towards higher value-added smart products. Herein, we report on the fabrication of a novel dual-functional textile device merging enhanced energy storage performance with optical properties. A redox-active solid-gel electrolyte based on fluorescent manganese(II)-doped zinc(II) sulfide was for the first time used to endow the dual functionality to the device when combined with MWCNT-coated textile electrodes. The textile electrodes were prepared through an eco-sustainable straightforward dip-pad-dry process using a natural cotton fabric substrate. The fluorescent hybrid textile supercapacitor exhibited enhanced energy storage performance relative to the EDLC-type analogue containing the undoped electrolyte, namely 20% higher working voltage (1.64 V), 48% higher energy density (1.63 W h kg−1) and 74% higher power density (641.6 W kg−1). Additionally, it presented excellent cycling stability (100%) after 8000 charge/discharge cycles. The device exhibited intense yellow-orange fluorescence under UV light, while preserving the energy storage functionality. This work demonstrated the versatility of this type of devices for dark environment applications, namely in reflective/safety electronic clothing for nighttime users.}

Fatigue is a pervasive problem in paramedic, police, and firefighting occupations, where personnel experience significant levels of physical fatigue, cognitive task- and sleep-related fatigue, burnout, and emotional fatigue. A fatigue risk management standard is being developed and is informed from several sources, including a scoping review of first responder fatigue literature. The objective of this paper is to report on findings from the scoping review to (1) identify measures and tools used by researchers to assess fatigue-related risks, and (2) organize these measures and tools into adapted SOBANE risk management categories to facilitate their selection by organizations and occupational health and safety practitioners. We identified 60 unique measures and tools for the five different dimensions of fatigue across all first response occupations. Several fatigue measurements found in occupational fatigue literature and critical industry fatigue management were not reported; future research should investigate the development of predictive models and the reliability and validity of these tools in first response. The results of this scoping review provide a starting point for organizations to assess fatigue, of any dimension, but the psychometric properties of the identified measures and tools should be considered.}

This article provides overview of these concerns, highlighting the various ways in which smart city technologies can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other security threats. Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model. In addition, smart city water systems that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at risk of hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water supply. Further research is required to better understand the potential risks associated with smart city technologies and develop new solutions to address them. This article shows as a valuable resource for city administrators, policymakers and researchers interested in the security and privacy concerns of smart cities.}

For the second objective, a user study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the warning glove is capable of obtaining faster responses and to determine the perceptions of the users regarding the appropriateness of the warning glove. The results confirmed the assumption of faster response times and participants perceived the warning glove to be ‘fairly appropriate’.

abstract = {Background
Novel strategies are required to address rising overdose deaths across the globe. We sought to identify the breadth and depth of the existing evidence around electronic harm reduction (e-harm reduction) interventions that aimed to reduce the harms associated with substance use.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA-ScR and PRISMA for Searching guidelines. A health sciences librarian systematically searched seven health databases from inception until January 20, 2023. Citation chaining and reference lists of included studies were searched to identify additional articles. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted and charted the data. Additionally, we conducted a gray literature search and environmental scan to supplement the findings.
Results
A total of 51 studies met the criteria for inclusion (30 peer-reviewed articles and 21 non-peer reviewed). Most peer-reviewed studies were conducted in Western countries (USA = 23, Canada = 3, Europe = 3, China = 1) and among adult samples (adult = 27, youth/adults =1, unspecified = 2). Study designs were predominantly quantitative (n = 24), with a minority using qualitative (n = 4) or mixed methods (n = 2). Most e-harm reduction interventions were harm reduction (n = 15), followed by education (n = 6), treatment (n = 2), and combined/other approaches (n = 7). Interventions utilized web-based/mobile applications (n = 15), telephone/telehealth (n = 10), and other technology (n = 5).
Conclusions
While e-harm reduction technology is promising, further research is required to establish the efficacy and effectiveness of these novel interventions.}

However, the use of masks often causes soaring temperatures and thick humid air, leading to thermal and wear discomfort and breathing difficulties for a number of people, and further increasing the elevated risk of heat illnesses including heat stroke and heat exhaustion. When wearers become highly active or work under high tension, the excess sweat generated negatively affects the functionality of masks. Here, we report on an innovative design of an air-conditioned mask (AC Mask) system, facilitating thermoregulation in the mask microclimate, ease of breathing, and wear comfort. The AC Mask system is developed by integrating a cost-effective and lightweight thermoelectric (TE) and ventilation unit in a wearable 3D printed mask device, compatible with existing disposable masks, to protect end users safely against toxic particles such as viruses. A wind-guided tunnel has been developed for quick and efficient ventilation of cooling air. Based on a human trial, reductions in the apparent microclimate temperature and the humidity by 3.5 °C and 50%, respectively, have been achieved under a low voltage. With the excellent thermal management properties, the AC Mask will find also wide application among professional end-users such as construction workers, firefighters, and medical personnel.}

Traditional methods available till date for detection of material i.e. those important for forensic investigation are time consuming, costly as well as the require expertise handling. Nano based biosensors can assist with high-throughput, large-scale and sensitive screening of the samples or specimens to find target compounds at very low concentration with high evidential value in forensic evidence. Without the requirement for extra laboratory instrumentation or equipment or time-consuming preparatory procedures, nanomaterial based biosensors offer sensitive and reasonably priced examination of materials. Therefore, in this review article emphasis has been given on development of nanomaterial based biosensors, as well as the most recent developments in the forensic examination of a wide range of chemicals, including alcohol, narcotic drugs, and explosives has been discussed. In nutshell, nano-material based biosensors can offer a reliable means for finding forensically relevant evidence as they will also reduce analysis times, turn large instruments into compact chip-based platforms, and make investigations more timely, sensitive, and applicable leading to dismissal of the criminal case early. Overall, biosensors and in particular nanobiosensors offer a promising solution for many challenges faced by society today. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of nanobiosensors in the future.}

abstract = {We examined the impact of performing a tone counting task of varying cognitive loads and mathematical calculations simultaneously, compared to performance on the same tasks done individually. Participants performed continuous mathematical calculations, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the math and counting tasks simultaneously. Performing the two tasks together resulted in significant dual-task interference. We also compared these results to previous studies employing the tone counting tasks with physically demanding tasks (climbing, kayaking and running). The interference between tone counting and mathematical calculations was worse than the interference between tone counting and running and kayaking. For climbing, the difference in interference was more nuanced with evidence indicating climbing uniquely asserts task prioritization. These findings have implications for operations requiring dual or multi-tasking.}

The decreasing costs and increasing performance of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have made wearable devices more cost effective. Different types of wearable devices are being used today by citizens to improve their health and lifestyle. However, the data (such as health-related or movement data) generated from the user’s daily activities is often private and therefore, ensuring the security and privacy of this data is important. First, we present some emerging trends of wearable devices followed by a discussion of the main security and functionality requirements along with the threats to the wearable communication environment. We then present a review of some of the recently proposed lightweight authentication protocols for wearable devices based on performance metrics such as computation cost and communication cost. We also compare these authentication protocols in terms of various security features they support. Finally, we discuss some future challenges in the area of security protocols for wearable devices that need to be addressed in the future.}

These disorders decrease worker's productivity, impact industries economically, and cause serious psycho-physical conditions. However, technological advances have leveraged the industry to a novel phase where digitalization and automation provide a new reality. Hence, this industrial transformation may contribute to assists human beings in the workplace with a focus on mental health. This article presents a systematic literature review to investigate studies regarding technologies employed in the care of worker's mental health and the industrial role in this scenario. Three general, three focused, and three descriptive questions highlight the academic progress of industrial concern on mental health, implemented systems and cases, and research challenges. As a result, the review discussed 31 studies, extracted from an initial corpus of 25269, ranging from January 2010 to November 2020. The studies approached stress as the most frequent mental issue in the industry and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the most used machine learning algorithm, where biomarkers presented the primary data extractors to deal with this theme. Moreover, information fusion methods improved the accuracy of specific cases. However, a growing interest in mental health care has emerged only in recent years, and several challenges require efforts before applying systems in real industrial environments.}

Substantial individual variability in physiological tolerance to thermal stress necessitates an individualized approach to mitigate the deleterious effects of thermal stress, such as physiological monitoring of individual thermal strain. During heat exposure, measurements of deep-body (Tc) and skin temperatures and heart rate can provide some indication of thermal strain. Combining these physiological variables with biomechanical markers of gait (in)stability may provide further insight on central nervous system dysfunction – the key criterion of exertional heat stroke (EHS). Thermal strain in cold environments can be monitored with skin temperature (peripheral and proximal), shivering thermogenesis and Tc. Non-invasive methods for real-time estimation of Tc have been developed and some appear to be promising but require further validation. Decision-support tools provide useful information for planning activities and biomarkers can be used to improve their predictions, thus maximizing safety and performance during hot- and cold-weather operations. With better understanding on the etiology and pathophysiology of EHS, the microbiome and markers of the inflammatory responses have been identified as novel biomarkers of heat intolerance. This review aims to (i) discuss selected physiological and biomechanical markers of heat or cold strain, (ii) how biomarkers may be used to ensure operational readiness in hot and cold environments, and (iii) present novel molecular biomarkers (e.g., microbiome, inflammatory cytokines) for preventing EHS.}

Heat strain and dehydration can affect an individual’s physical and mental performance. The purpose of this review was to examine the literature for the impact of heat strain on health care workers (HCWs) who care for patients with high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), discuss the risks of impaired safety caused by heat strain and dehydration in HCID environments, identify attempts to combat PPE-related heat strain, recognize limitations, and provide suggestions for further research.
Methods
A literature search was performed in PubMed or MEDLINE and Google Scholar. Authors screened abstracts for inclusion criteria and reviewed articles if the abstracts were considered to include information relevant to the aim.
Results
The search terms yielded 30 articles that were sorted based on environment setting, physiological impact, and interventions.
Discussion
The safety of the HCWs and patients can be enhanced through the development and usage of cooler, more comfortable PPE materials and ensembles to help slow the rate of dehydration and support the regulation of core body temperature.
Conclusions
Heat strain caused by wearing PPE is an occupational health concern for HCWs in the high-risk environment, that is, HCID care. Future studies are needed to develop innovative PPE ensembles that can reduce heat strain and improve well-being.}

abstract = {Objective
To better understand how older adults currently manage emergency information, the barriers and facilitators to planning and management of emergency information, as well as the potential role of information technology to facilitate emergency planning and management.
Introduction
Older adults face a much higher risk of sudden illness/injury and are the age group with the largest percentages of emergent and urgent healthcare visits. Emergency information (health information needed in an emergency situation such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives) needs to be maintained and easily accessible to ensure older adults get appropriate care and treatment consistent with their wishes in emergency situations. Current health information technologies rarely take into consideration the emergency information needs of older adults, their caregivers, and emergency responders.
Methods
As part of a larger study we performed in-depth interviews with 90 older adults living in a variety of residential settings (independent living, retirement communities, assisted living) regarding how they manage information about their health. Interview sessions included photos of important health information artifacts. Interviews were transcribed and coded.
Results
Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that emergency information is a type of health information that older adults frequently manage. Participants differed in whether they practice emergency planning (e.g. the preparation and continued management of emergency information), and in whether they involve others in emergency information and emergency planning. Despite its importance, emergency information was often not up-to-date and not always kept in locations readily apparent to emergency responders.
Conclusion
Emergency information, such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives, is a type of health information that older adults manage. Considering emergency information in the design of health information technologies for older adults could address some of the barriers and support the facilitators to emergency planning and information management.}

The algorithm and device have been tested in two controlled fire behaviour training environments in both the UK and US during multiple flashovers, demonstrating the integrity of the predictions and subsequent alarm triggering in this environment, specifically, triggering an alarm 27 s ahead of flashover for a unit positioned at firefighter crouching height (0.8 m). These experiments included testing on a reference mannequin to explore the potential impact of the boundary effect on temperature measurements close to a tunic, as well as the impact of simulated firefighter movement on the output predictions and therefore alarm states. The results from subsequent testing of the devices in realistic firefighting conditions by firefighter instructors demonstrate the dynamic response of the algorithm to changing conditions equivalent to a serious domestic building fire, including the potential benefit of the precautionary ‘pre-alarm’. Finally, a snapshot of results from extended trials in an uncontrolled training environment with multiple firefighters is discussed, including early developments towards a potential concept of use including cloud-based aggregation of individual firefighter temperature exposure data.}

abstract = {Background
Cardiac arrests are often categorized into two separate groups depending on the location of the arrest: in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Despite this distinction, few studies have compared the two groups directly. The aim of this study was to compare patient characteristics, cardiac arrest characteristics, and outcomes for IHCA and OHCA patients.
Methods
Data on IHCA and OHCA in Denmark were obtained from two nationwide, prospective registries. All adult (≥18 years old) patients with index IHCA or OHCA from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 were included. Supplementary information on outcomes, hospitalizations, and chronic diseases came from additional national registries. The primary outcome was 30-day survival and secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 1-year survival.
Results
The study included 3501 patients with IHCA and 8846 patients with OHCA. The two groups were similar in demographics, most comorbidities, and initial cardiac arrest rhythm. In the unadjusted analysis, IHCA was associated with increased survival to 30 days compared to OHCA (risk ratio [RR] = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.30; 1.54) and 1 year (RR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.33; 1.61). Adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities did not change the RR substantially. When cardiac arrest characteristics were added to the model, the RR decreased from 1.51 (95% CI, 1.39; 1.65) to 1.06 (95% CI, 0.93; 1.20) for survival to 30 days and from 1.66 (95% CI, 1.50; 1.84) to 1.09 (95% CI, 0.94; 1.26) for survival to 1 year. In all subgroup analyses based on cardiac arrest characteristics (e.g. witnessed status), the association between location and outcome was substantially mitigated compared to the primary analyses.
Conclusions
In this large, national study, we found that IHCA and OHCA patients were remarkably similar in demographics and most comorbidities. IHCA patients had better outcomes compared to OHCA patients, although these differences disappeared when comparing patients with similar cardiac arrest characteristics.}

Researchers and medical practitioners need safe and cheaper means of performing their research, ensuring public safety, and delivering customised health options to patients. One such solution can be easily carried out by using biosensors. In the new medical field, biomedical studies of diagnosis are of growing significance. Biosensors' applications are for screening infectious to early detection, chronic disease treatment, health management, and well-being surveillance. Improved biosensors technology qualities allow the ability to detect disease and track the body's response to care. Sensor technology is integral to numerous, low-cost, and improved-form factors feasible in modern medical devices. Biosensors have good potential, as it is easy, scalable and effective in manufacturing processes. This paper discusses biosensors and their significant benefits in the medical field. Distinctive capabilities of biosensors in healthcare services and for cardiovascular disease are provided and shown diagrammatically. The paper also discusses various diagnostic biosensors for cardiovascular diseases and provides novel aspects of biosensors for clinical and allied services. Thereby paper provides significant advancements in biosensors in the medical field. Finally, fourteen major applications of biosensors in the medical field are identified and discussed. Biosensors' intelligent wearable properties now allow older people to control their health with lesser interference, and it directly exchanges their medical-related information with healthcare providers, thereby reducing hospital visits. Thus, biosensors have countless prospects for consumer and commercial uses in wellness, fitness, athletics, etc. Linked biomedical devices, apps, firmware, and sophisticated algorithms will do a lot, including allowing major new medical therapies and informing users about health reform, providing solutions and advice informed by real-time evidence.}

Cardiac arrest (CA) is the cessation of circulation to vital organs that can only be reversed with rapid and appropriate interventions. Sensor technologies for early detection and activation of the emergency medical system could enable rapid response to CA and increase the probability of survival. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the literature surrounding the performance of sensor technologies in detecting OHCA.
Methods
We searched the academic and grey literature using keywords related to cardiac arrest, sensor technologies, and recognition/detection. We included English articles published up until June 6, 2022, including investigations and patent filings that reported the sensitivity and specificity of sensor technologies to detect cardiac arrest on human or animal subjects. (Prospero# CRD42021267797).
Results
We screened 1666 articles and included four publications examining sensor technologies. One tested the performance of a physical sensor on human participants in simulated CA, one tested performance on audio recordings of patients in cardiac arrest, and two utilized a hybrid design for testing including human participants and ECG databases. Three of the devices were wearable and one was an audio detection algorithm utilizing household smart technologies. Real-world testing was limited in all studies. Sensitivity and specificity for the sensors ranged from 97.2 to 100% and 90.3 to 99.9%, respectively. All included studies had a medium/high risk of bias, with 2/4 having a high risk of bias.
Conclusions
Sensor technologies show promise for cardiac arrest detection. However, current evidence is sparse and of high risk of bias. Small sample sizes and databases with low external validity limit the generalizability of findings.}

abstract = {The growing demand for smart wearables, coupled with the omnipresence of graphene due to its array of outstanding thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, have driven the industry-led initiatives to develop lightweight, smart, and robust graphene-based wearable technologies. The substantial research and the increase in technology readiness levels (TRLs) of graphene-based technologies have led to the adoption of graphene in many industries. Graphene-based wearables are one such technology that involves closer interaction of graphene by the end-user. Despite this, understanding the toxicological risks associated with using graphene-based wearables is still in the fundamental stage. Herein, graphene-based wearables and industrial-scale fabrication techniques for the development of graphene-based wearables are reviewed. The main goal of the review is to initially evaluate the likelihood of user exposure to graphene from the wearable device and the potential health effects. The subsequent health risks based on graphene's physicochemical characteristics are also discussed. A framework to elucidate the risk is presented in terms of crucial exposure routes, possible graphene interactions, recent exposure assessments, detection removal techniques from the human body, and risk management protocols. It is hoped that this review may aid towards establishing a reasonable practice concerning the safe integration of graphene materials into wearables and facilitate their commercialization.}

Disease-related treatment action plans for acute exacerbations providing information that may be helpful for self-management for patients and caregivers are commonly used for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes. However, among patients with epilepsy, a review of the literature suggested that the majority did not have an action plan in place for acute seizure treatment.
Recent findings
Currently, there is a lack of unified guidance on seizure action plans (SAPs) in the literature. In the authors’ opinion, available formats have limitations for practical use and may not be easily customizable to individual patients, and they are not often designed to provide simple-to-follow steps for rapid immediate steps to determine and initiate appropriate treatment of seizure emergencies. Our group reviewed current examples of SAPs and provided guidance on the development of acute seizure action plans (ASAPs) designed to facilitate rapid, appropriate acute care in the community and to be as useful as possible for a wide range of care partners, including those with limited experience.
Summary
This paper provides agreed upon expert opinion recommendations and considerations for goals, development process, types of content, and format for an ASAP.}

While the article discusses these innovations from a nursing perspective, the issues raised can apply to any healthcare discipline. Accordingly, it is essential for regulatory bodies to explore how these potentially disruptive innovations will be regulated. Finding regulatory solutions is necessary if today’s industrial-era regulatory model is to evolve into one fit for a rapidly-changing, complex digital environment where healthcare delivery is increasingly dependent on new technologies. Having considered the wider literature on how regulators address disruptive innovation, we conclude the nursing profession, and regulated professions in general, can learn from these experiences.

abstract = {Background
The relatively decreased time spent in the operating room and overall reduction in cases performed by neurosurgical trainees as a result of duty-hour restrictions demands that the pedagogical content within each surgical encounter be maximized and crafted toward the specific talents and shortcomings of the individual. It is imperative to future generations that the quality of training adapts to the changing administrative infrastructures and compensates for anything that may compromise the technical abilities of trainees. Neurosurgeons in teaching hospitals continue to experiment with various emerging technologies—such as simulators and virtual presence—to supplement and improve surgical training.
Methods
The authors participated in the Google Glass Explorer Program in order to assess the applicability of Google Glass as a tool to enhance the operative education of neurosurgical residents. Google Glass is a type of wearable technology in the form of eyeglasses that employs a high-definition camera and allows the user to interact using voice commands.
Results
Google Glass was able to effectively capture video segments of various lengths for residents to review in a variety of clinical settings within a large, tertiary care university hospital, as well as during a surgical mission to a developing country. The resolution and quality of the video were adequate to review and use as a teaching tool.
Conclusion
While Google Glass harbors the potential to dramatically improve both neurosurgical education and practice in a variety of ways, certain technical drawbacks of the current model limit its effectiveness as a teaching tool.}

Narrative review
Results
Delayed activation of EMS for stroke symptoms by patients and witnesses deprives patients of rapid access to brain-saving therapies and occurs due to public unawareness of stroke features, cognitive and motor deficits produced by the stroke itself, and sleep onset. A promising emerging approach to overcoming the inherent biologic constraints of patient capacity to self-detect and respond to stroke symptoms is continuous monitoring by mobile health technologies with wireless sensors and artificial intelligence recognition systems. This review surveys 11 sensing technologies - accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors, touch screen and keyboard input detectors, artificial vision, and artificial hearing; and 10 consumer device form factors in which they are increasingly implemented: smartphones, smart speakers, smart watches and fitness bands, smart speakers/voice assistants, home health robots, smart clothing, smart beds, closed circuit television, smart rings, and desktop/laptop/tablet computers.
Conclusions
The increase in computing power, wearable sensors, and mobile connectivity have ushered in an array of mobile health technologies that can transform stroke detection and EMS activation. By continuously monitoring a diverse range of biometric parameters, commercially available devices provide the technologic capability to detect cardinal language, motor, gait, and sensory signs of stroke onset. Intensified translational research to convert the promise of these technologies to validated, accurate real-world deployments are an important next priority for stroke investigation.}

Efforts have been made to integrate these systems to vehicles mostly for security purposes and user authentication. Until now, most of the systems do not go beyond using facial and fingerprint data to start the engine or access the car; however, new generations demand more personalization plus the vehicle making decisions based on their physiological characteristics. Although this kind of technology is considered a luxury feature in general, actually it could help users and save their lives. Indeed, biometry is the way to make the human-vehicle relationship happen, whether the biometric devices are embedded inside the vehicle, used as an accessory or wearables. By using as input not only the sensors inside the vehicle but also data from outside, the vehicle could adapt and/or learn new information to make the best possible decision.}

This study provides a simple and effective strategy to improve the flame retardancy of textiles through a synergistic effect between the blended fibers, and a system with synergistic in flame retardant vinylon (FRV)/poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) blended fibers is discovered. The FRV/PMIA 50/50 exhibits a much higher time to ignition and a lower peak heat release rate than those of the neat components, indicating a synergistic flame retardancy between constituents. The corresponding mechanism is explored. The residual char layer formed by blended fibers connects together and keeps the original fiber shape, which acts as a barrier slowing heat transmission and gas diffusion. Concurrently, thermal degradation analysis of blended fibers implies that both components mutually interact with each other, resulting in a higher experimental amount of incombustible gases at an early degradation stage and lower experimental amount of combustible gases at a later degradation stage as compared to the theoretical one. Therefore, the synergistic flame retardancy in FRV/PMIA blended fibers is attributed to the actions in the condensed and gas phases during pyrolysis. This work provides an effective strategy to design fireproof textiles.}

Herein, we provide a review of recent developments in wearable biochemical and biophysical systems. We survey the sweat sampling and collection methods for biochemical systems, followed by an assessment of biochemical and biophysical sensors deployed in current wearable systems with an emphasis on their hardware specifications. Specifically, we address how sweat collection and sample handling platforms may be a rate limiting technology to realizing the clinical translation of wearable health monitoring systems; moreover, we highlight the importance of achieving both longitudinal sensing and assessment of intrapersonal variation in sweat-blood correlations to have the greatest clinical impact.

Flexible temperature sensors offer conformal attachment with the human skin for stable and continuous measurements and have therefore garnered extensive attention in recent years. However, although significant achievement has been made in terms of enhancing sensitivity or gaining stability under deformation, they are still limited by low accuracy under large mechanical strain, slow response in dynamic environments, increasing hysteresis and limited measurement range. In addition, large and continuous mapping in flexible formats is required to accurately realize temporal and spatial variation of physiological temperature before such devices can be practically applied for continuous health monitoring or in electronic skin measurements. This review comprehensively presents significant advances in flexible temperature sensors based on nanocomposite materials categorizing the work according to materials, sensor design, sensing mechanisms and compatible fabrication strategies. For comparison, a few traditional temperature sensors are also reported. Finally, critical issues in the field are discussed, technical gaps are highlighted and possible solutions are suggested that may help overcome the existing challenges.}

This study builds on a national report and a qualitative study, completed in the United States, which explored librarians' attitudes on privacy. Adding a Canadian voice to the literature, this study examines survey results from academic librarians in Canada on their perceptions and attitudes related to library practices and online privacy behaviors. Overall, Canadian academic librarians believe that protecting patron privacy and educating patrons about issues related to online privacy is important. However, many Canadian academic librarians doubt that libraries are doing all they can to protect patron privacy. Academic librarians stand to gain knowledge and understanding of peer attitudes toward online privacy, as well as how patron privacy is being advocated for and protected on university campuses across Canada. The results will guide future library policies and programming aimed at creating an environment where privacy rights are protected and patrons can make informed choices about their online actions.}

Traditional firearms use gunpowder, which limits the gun's use to a single function and quickly depletes the ammo supply. The coil gun, which uses electrical energy harvested from a Bio-thermal energy harvester, allows multifunctional bullets to be used in a rifle during an emergency without exploding. As coil cannon projectiles, deflected bullets or bullet shells from the battlefield can be used if necessary. This means that energy collecting and conversion for autonomous and flexible wearable technologies, as well as other applications like Internet of Things (IoTs), military, industrial, consumer and non-consumer domains, will become an extensively explored topic. Nowadays, energy independence is a hot concern thanks to flexible gadgets' rising popularity. Thermoelectric energy harvesting, a potential new method to gather easily accessible body heat, is particularly well-suited to the wearing of sensors and electronics. A coil gun battery can be charged using a thermoelectric generator (TEG), which can harness energy from the human body. The thermoelectric generator and charger can both be found in a single patch that can be worn. The TEG ANSYS model is used in this research project. Human body heat can be used to power highly specialized applications like medical ones since it is reliable and natural. The average human body produces roughly 100 W of heat while at rest, and about 525 W of heat while exercising.}

Furthermore, conventional methods of measuring physiological parameters in order to calculate personal thermophysiological constraints are not practical to use during work tasks. However, the emergence of wearable technologies can contribute to real-time measurement of body temperature and the biometric signals needed to assess thermophysiological constraints while actively working.

Compared to other professions, firefighters are at high risk for musculoskeletal injuries, mental illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to systemically review the effects of sleep on firefighter occupational performance and health. A search was conducted for studies that conducted a quantitative analysis involving sleep and occupational performance in firefighters. Relevant data were extracted and study quality evaluated with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. There were 15 articles meeting the inclusion criteria with a total sample of 1591 (1539 male, 52 female) firefighters. We found that firefighters with poor sleep measures had worse cognitive performance and overall health, but physical capabilities were not impacted by acute sleep restriction. However, chronic poor sleep would likely negatively impact physical performance due to being associated with a decline in numerous health measures. To avoid sleep-related declines in occupational performance fire departments should consider the consequences of shift schedules on the performance and health of firefighters. Furthermore, sleep education interventions, the use of wearables to monitor, recovery and sleep health screening appear beneficial based on prior research.}
