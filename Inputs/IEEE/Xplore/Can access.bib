  abstract={The emerging technology breakthrough of the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to offer promising solutions for indoor/outdoor healthcare, which may contribute significantly to human health and well-being. In this paper, we investigated the technologies of healthcare service applications in telemedicine architecture. We aimed to resolve a series of healthcare problems on the frequent failures in telemedicine architecture through IoT solutions, particularly the failures of wearable body sensors (Tier 1) and a medical center server (Tier 3). For improved generalisability, we demonstrated an effective research approach, the fault-tolerant framework on mHealth or the so-called FTF-mHealth-IoT in the context of IoT, to resolve essential problems in current investigations on healthcare services. First, we propose a risk local triage algorithm known as the risk-level localization triage (RLLT), which can exclude the control process of patient triage from the medical center by using mHealth and can warn about failures related to wearable sensors. RLLT performs this initial step towards detecting a patient's emergency case and then identifying the healthcare service package of the risk-level. Second, according to the risk-level package, our framework can aid decision makers in hospital selection through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). Accordingly, mHealth can connect directly with the servers of distributed hospitals to ascertain available healthcare services for the risk-level package in those hospitals. The time of arrival of the patient at the hospital (TAH) is considered for each hospital to reach a final decision and select the appropriate institution in case of medical center failure. This paper used two datasets. The first dataset involved 572 patients with chronic heart disease. Their triage levels were evaluated using our RLLT algorithm. The second dataset included hospital healthcare services with two levels of availability within distributed hospitals to show variety when testing the proposed framework. The former dataset is an actual dataset of services collected from 12 hospitals located in the capital Baghdad, which represents the maximum level of availability. The latter is an assumption dataset of the services within the 12 hospitals located in the capital Kuala Lumpur, which represents the minimum level of availability. Subsequently, the hospitals were prioritized using a unique MCDM method for estimating small power consumption, namely, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), based on a crossover between the “healthcare services package/TAH” of each hospital and the “hospital list”. The results showed that the AHP is effective for solving hospital selection problems within mHealth. The implications of this study support the patients, organizations, and medical staff in a modern lifestyle.},

  pages={88821-88857},
  abstract={Recreation of 3D crime scenes is critical for law enforcement in the investigation of serious crimes for criminal justice responses. This work presents a premier systematic literature review (SLR) that offers a structured, methodical, and rigorous approach to understanding the trend of research in 3D crime scene reconstruction as well as tools, technologies, methods, and techniques employed thereof in the last 17 years. Major credible scholarly database sources, Scopus, and Google Scholar, which index journals and conferences that are promoted by entities such as IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, and SpringerLink were explored as data sources. Of the initial 17, 912 papers that resulted from the first search string, 258 were found to be relevant to our research questions after implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To summarize the existing efforts, we compared and analysed various classical 3D reconstruction approaches. This study presents the first comprehensive review of key milestones in the development of methods for 3D crime scene reconstruction, gaps for improvement and where immersive technology has been used to enhance crime scene findings. This study found that the implementation of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanners and immersive technologies, alongside traditional methods, has been beneficial in the recreation of crime scenes. The SLR is limited to existing applications with peer-reviewed papers published between 2005 and 2021. Results based on the analysed published data indicated that 20.2% of the articles implemented immersive technologies in crime scene reconstruction, of which Augmented Reality (AR) accounted for 15.3%, Virtual Reality (VR) accounted for 75%, Mixed reality (MR) accounted for 5.9% and VR and AR mixture accounted for 3.8%. Finally, we summarize the development trend of design and key technology prospects of crime scene recreation using immersive technology and provide insights into potential future research. To the best of the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first survey that accomplishes such goals.},

  abstract={In recent times, the emergence of the Metaverse has garnered worldwide attention as an innovative digital space that holds immense potential to provide a wide range of health services to medical professionals and patients. With increasing stress on healthcare systems, it has become crucial to explore the latest and cost-effective solutions that can provide fast and reliable medical services. The focus of this study, therefore, is to explore applications of metaverse in various health care systems and elaborate on how it can efficiently improve the clinical management of patients. Consequently, an in-depth assessment of the metaverse has been carried out, while covering its core fundamentals, key technologies, and diverse applications in healthcare and medicine, including but not limited to, emergency response learning, hands-on experience in anatomy learning, orthopaedics, paediatrics and so on. To carry out the study, we have used an exploratory approach to analyze qualitative data on healthcare metaverse services in our systematic review. Relevant articles from scientific databases such as Web of Science, Springer, Scopus, and IEEE have been identified, and the analysis has been conducted using the PRISMA reporting guideline to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting. The results of the study suggest that the metaverse has the potential to transform healthcare systems by introducing novel methods for delivering healthcare services. Metaverse’s AR/VR technologies can enable remote medical consultations and training, benefiting patients and healthcare professionals. Additionally, patients can access health-related information and resources, empowering them to manage their health better and make more informed decisions.},

  pages={23367-23393},
  abstract={In this work, a novel computational approach for the dynamic adaptation of User Interfaces (UIs) is proposed, which aims at enhancing the Situational Awareness (SA) of users by leveraging the current context and providing the most useful information, in an optimal and efficient manner. By combining Ontology modeling and reasoning with Combinatorial Optimization, the system decides what information to present, when to present it, where to visualize it in the display - and how, taking into consideration contextual factors as well as placement constraints. The main objective of the proposed approach is to optimize the SA associated with the displayed UI at run-time, while avoiding information overload and induced stress. In the context of this work, we have deployed our computational approach to the use case of an Augmented Reality (AR) system for Law Enforcement Agents (LEAs). To explore the benefits and limitations of the developed system, two evaluations have been conducted. The first one was an expert-based evaluation with LEAs and User Experience (UX) experts, assessing the appropriateness of the system’s decisions. The second one was a user-based evaluation involving LEAs from different agencies, estimating the SA, the mental workload and the overall UX associated with the system, through an AR simulation. The results indicate that the system enhances SA, and while not imposing workload, it provides an overall positive UX.},

  title={Single Channel EEG Classification: A Case Study on Prediction of Major Depressive Disorder Treatment Outcome}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={3417-3427},
  abstract={In multichannel EEG, several electrodes are attached to the head that may be annoying for patients and troublesome for operators. Moreover, the number of electrodes is the main reason of the infeasibility of developing EEG based wearable and point of care devices. To address this problem, recently, the concept of single-channel EEG (SCEEG) is presented. The spatial resolution of SCEEG is lower than the multichannel one, but it is easy to use, cost-effective, ubiquitous, and wearable. In this paper, for the first time, we have developed the concept of SCEEG for the classification of responders and nonresponders to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD). We also compared the performance of SCEEG and multichannel EEG with the different number of channels in the prediction of responding to rTMS treatment. 19-electrode EEG is recorded from 46 MDD patients before rTMS treatment. Among participants, 23 individuals responded to treatment. The dataset is partitioned into the training (36 subjects) and testing (10 subjects) datasets. Linear and nonlinear features were extracted from every channel of EEG. In training, to select informative features, the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) algorithm was applied. The selected features were classified by k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier, which is evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Then the obtained classifier is applied to the testing dataset. The results demonstrated that the F8 channel classifies responders and nonresponders with an accuracy of 80%. Moreover, our results revealed that SCEEG could perform as multichannel EEG in the prediction of rTMS treatment outcome in MDD patients. The obtained accuracy indicates that our proposed method based on SCEEG has a high potential for predicting rTMS treatment outcome in MDD patients.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},

  pages={66188-66207},
  abstract={Ensuring women’s safety in smart cities is a need of the hour. Even though several legal and technological steps are adopted worldwide, women’s safety continues to be an international concern. Criminal records are maintained by law enforcement agencies and are most often not available to the public in an easily comprehensible form. While some wearable devices and mobile applications are available which are touted to aid in ensuring women’s safety, they utilize limited societal intervention and are not very efficient in ensuring the safety of the women as and when required. Most often the crime response, crime analysis, and crime prevention schemes are not integrated, leading to gaps in ensuring women’s safety. Our major contribution is in developing a holistic system encompassing the three crucial aspects, i.e crime analysis and mapping, crime prevention, and emergency response by leveraging societal participation for women safety management. This work applies the Geographic Information System (GIS) for the identification of hotspots and patterns of crime. The proposed system uses data generated from the mobile application and/or wearable gadget prototyped as a part of this work along with the criminal history records for crime response, analysis, and prevention. The system for the hotspot identification is demonstrated for the Pilani town in the Jhunjhunu district in the state of Rajasthan, India, and can be easily scaled up geographically and utilized as a safety strategy for smart cities. While the common man is provided a cost-effective solution via the developed mobile application or wearable gadget, the various components are integrated into a website for supervisory management and can be utilized by law enforcement agencies.},

  pages={213574-213586},
  abstract={Electroencephalography (EEG) is immediate and sensitive to cortical impairment resulting from ischemic stroke and is considered as the potential predictive tool of stroke onset, and post-stroke clinical management. Brainwave monitoring outside the heavily equipped clinical environment demands a low-cost, portable, and wearable EEG system. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using an ambulatory EEG system to classify the stroke patient group with neurological changes due to ischemic stroke and the control healthy adult group. HealthSOS, a real-time health monitoring system for stroke prognostics, is proposed here, which consists of an eye-mask embedded portable EEG device, data analytics, and medical ontology based health advisor service. This system was investigated with 37 stroke patients (mean age 71.6 years, 61% male) admitted in the emergency unit of a hospital and 36 healthy elderly volunteers (mean age 76 years, 28% male). EEG was recorded in resting-state using the portable device with frontal cortical electrodes (Fp1, Fp2) embedded in an eye-mask within 120 h after the onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke (confirmed clinically). The EEG data acquisition of the left and right brain hemispheres was done for at least 15 minutes in the awake resting state while subjects laid down on the bed. The statistical result shows that the revised brain symmetry index (rsBSI), the delta-alpha ratio, and the delta-theta ratio of the stroke group differ significantly from those of the healthy control group. In the machine learning analysis, the support vector machine (SVM) model shows the highest accuracy (Overall accuracy: 92%) and the highest Gini coefficient (95%) in classification performance. This study will be useful for early stroke prognostics and the management of post-stroke treatment.},

  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={174873-174888},
  abstract={Comprehensive multimodal psychophysiological measurements and smart data analysis based on wearable and low-cost technologies could enhance traditional air traffic controller (ATC) selection process. Many recent studies in neuro-cognitive science and stress resilience illustrated effectiveness of these multimodal measurements and appropriate metrics in comprehensive assessment of ATCs' mental states, such as cognitive workload, cognitive decline, attention deficit, fatigue, emotional and behavioural problems, etc. Accordingly, this article is focused on innovation efforts in ATC selection protocols based on a set of comprehensive stimuli and corresponding multimodal psychophysiological measurements. The concept of enhancement of ATC selection process presented in this article includes complex physiological, oculometric and speech measurements and appropriate metrics. From these multimodal measurements during specific stimulation tasks, which include different versions of acoustic startle stimuli, airblasts, semantically relevant aversive images and sounds, different versions of Stroop tests, visual tracking test, a complex set of multimodal-multidimensional features is computed as predictors of ATC candidates' future performance, like: stress resilience, workload capacity, attention, visual performance, working memory etc. Such cost-effective, more objective, non-invasive preliminary measurements, lasting no longer than 45 minutes may have good discriminative power and might be used in ATC selection processes as enhancement of current selection procedures. Comprehensive analysis of presented multimodal features during different experimental conditions might also be very useful in selection processes of other stressful professional jobs, like first responders, pilots, astronauts etc.},

  pages={14410-14421},
  abstract={The smart city is increasingly gaining worldwide attention. It has the potential to improve the quality of life in convenience, at work, and in safety, among many others' utilizations. Nevertheless, some of the emerging applications in the smart city are computation-intensive and time-sensitive, such as real-time vision processing applications used for public safety and the virtual reality classroom application. Both of them are hard to handle due to the quick turnaround requirements of ultra-short time and large amounts of computation that are necessary. Fortunately, the abundant resource of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can help to address this issue and improve the development of the smart city. In this paper, we focus on the problem that how to schedule tasks for these computation-intensive and time-sensitive smart city applications with the assistance of IoV based on multi-server mobile edge computing. Task scheduling is a critical issue due to the limited computational power, storage, and energy of mobile devices. To handle tasks from the aforementioned applications in the shortest time, this paper introduces a cooperative strategy for IoV and formulates an optimization problem to minimize the completion time with a specified cost. Furthermore, we develop four evolving variants based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the proposed problem: variable splitting ADMM, Gauss-Seidel ADMM, distributed Jacobi ADMM, and distributed improved Jacobi (DIJ)-ADMM algorithms. These algorithms incorporate an augmented Lagrangian function into the original objective function and divide the large problem into two sub-problems to iteratively solve each sub-problem. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have a better performance than the existing algorithms. In addition, the DIJ-ADMM algorithm demonstrates optimal performance, and it converges after approximately ten iterations and improves the task completion time and offloaded tasks by 89% and 40%, respectively.},

  title={Depth Sensors-Based Action Recognition Using a Modified K-Ary Entropy Classifier}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={58578-58595},
  abstract={Surveillance system is acquiring an ample interest in the field of computer vision. Existing surveillance system usually relies on optical or wearable sensors for indoor and outdoor activities. These sensors give reasonable performance in a simulation environment. However, when used under realistic settings, they could cause a large number of false alarms. Moreover, in a real-world scenario, positioning a depth camera at too great a distance from the subject could compromise image quality and result in the loss of depth information. Furthermore, depth information in RGB images may be lost when converting a 3D image to a 2D image. Therefore, extensive surveillance system research is moving on fused sensors, which has greatly improved action recognition performance. By taking into account the concept of fused sensors, this paper proposed a novel idea of a modified K-Ary entropy classifier algorithm to map the arbitrary size of vectors to a fixed-size subtree pattern for graph classification and to solve complex feature selection and classification problems using RGB-D data. The main aim of this paper is to increase the space between the intra-substructure nodes of a tree through entropy accumulation. Hence, the likelihood of classifying the minority class as belonging to the majority class has been reduced. The working of the proposed model has been described as follows: First, the depth and RGB images from three benchmark datasets have been taken as the input for the model. Then, using 2.5D cloud point modeling and ridge extraction, full-body features, and point-based features have been retrieved. Finally, for the efficacy of the surveillance system, a modified K-Ary entropy accumulation classifier is optimized by the probability-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm has been used. In both qualitative and quantitative experimental results, the testing results have shown 95.05%, 95.56%, and 95.08% performance over SYSU-ACTION, PRECIS HAR, and Northwestern-UCLA (N-UCLA) datasets. The proposed system could apply to various real-world emerging applications like human target tracking, security-critical human event detection, perimeter security, internet security, public safety etc.},

  abstract={With the prevalence of low-cost imaging devices (smartphones, tablets, camcorders, digital cameras, scanners, wearable, and IoT devices), images and videos have become the main modalities of information being exchanged in every walk of life. The ever-increasing convenience of image acquisition has facilitated instant distribution and sharing of multimedia on digital social platforms. In the meantime, powerful multimedia editing tools allow even unskilled people to easily manipulate digital content for malicious or criminal purposes. In all cases where multimedia serves as critical evidence, forensic technologies that help to determine the origin, the authenticity of multimedia sources, and the integrity of multimedia content become essential to forensic investigators. Imaging devices and post-acquisition processing software leave unique “fingerprints” in multimedia content. This allows many challenging problems faced by the multimedia forensics community to be addressed through source inference. Source inference is the task of linking digital content to the source device or platform (e.g., social media such as Facebook) responsible for its creation. It can facilitate applications such as identification and verification of source device and platform, common source inference, content integrity verification, and source-oriented image clustering. It also allows the establishment of digital evidence or the history of multimedia processing steps applied to the content, starting from the acquisition procedure and up to tracking the spread. The recent adoption of multimedia source inference techniques in the law enforcement sector (e.g., U.K. Sussex Police, Guildford Crown Court, and INTERPOL) in real-world criminal cases and child sexual exploitation databases has manifested the significant value of multimedia source inference in the fight against crime. This Special Section in IEEE Access aims to collect a diverse and complementary set of articles that demonstrate new developments and applications in digital forensics through multimedia source inference.},

The techniques used for these robotic vehicles in the field of sensors, sensor data processing and control offer enormous potential to improve in integrated drive assistance systems the safety aspects of future cars in the streets. The team of the University Wuerzburg was involved in Mars Rover developments for the European Space Agency ESA and transferred similar navigation and tele-operation techniques also to industrial transport rovers and to remotely controlled rovers for harsh environments (by example to support fire fighters in search and rescue operations during emergencies). Related assistance systems support the tele-operator in situation awareness to more reliably detect obstacles and dangers. The vehicle should be able to handle difficult situations autonomously, like obstacle avoidance and a return to the base, in particular when the radio link is lost. Interesting progress in sensor systems (new principles like PMD-camera, future navigation systems like Galileo, ...), in miniaturization, in man-machine interfaces (like augmented reality approaches) and sensor data processing provide here exciting perspectives for innovations. Assistance systems enable a range of scalable reactions, which initiate appropriate actions adapted to the specific situation and to the operatorpsilas skills. As specific example the assistance system of University Wuerzburg will be presented, which was the winner of the ldquourban scenariordquo competition at ELROB 2007, where in a city environment hidden markers were to be detected and identified.},

Broadly, such data is generated mainly from three sources: Internet and Web applications, sensor networks, and mobile/wearable devices. The scale and richness of the multimodal, mixed data sources present us with an opportunity to compile the data into a comprehensive picture of individuals’ daily life facets, transform our understanding of our lives, organizations and societies, and enable completely innovative urban services, including public people and freight transportation, public safety, city resource management, environment monitoring, and social interaction assistance. However, raw data is heterogeneous, redundant, fragmented, and quality-variant, which prevents their direct use for analysis, management, forecasting and planning.
