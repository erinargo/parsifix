  abstract={Head Mounted Displays have the potential to increase the fire fighter's safety and make their work more efficient. Typical applications of Head Mounted Displays in the area of fire fighting are to display thermal imaging data or tactical information such as maps or navigation information. As fire fighters work under hazardous conditions they have to wear special equipment such as helmets and breathing masks. This makes an appropriate design of a Head Mounted Display for fire fighters especially challenging. In this paper we discuss the requirements of Head Mounted Displays for fire fighters and evaluate different design options.},

  abstract={Firefighters form action teams who work in challenging environments to solve complex situations. This type of work requires firefighters to have the relevant information about the emergency site and its surroundings in an efficient, effective way. We analyzed three focus groups from the evaluation of a previous mobile application to understand the needs of firefighters at an emergency site. Then, we developed an application that proposes two approaches to provide firefighters with quick access to data: an augmented reality interface and context-awareness to switch between views of the data. A preliminary evaluation with a small set of firefighters found the application to be useful to their work.},

  abstract={Wireless collaborative mixed reality (WCMR) has many fascinating applications in education, training, manu-facturing, and gaming. In this demo, we develop a WCMR-based firefighter training system that provides firefighters with experiences in extreme and diverse fire accidents without any safety concerns. In such a system, it is important to ensure that all firefighters can see almost the same status of the fire accident to facilitate collaborative training. This is challenging due to the heterogeneous communication delays of different network users. We propose the latency compensation algorithm that determines when the edge server should transmit the message to users based on the estimated latency of each user. Our experiment demon-strates around 55% synchronization performance improvement while guaranteeing at least 60 frames per second (FPS).},

  abstract={Augmented and Mixed Reality are promising technologies that can help First Responders in emergency situations by presenting the information in novel ways, extending situational awareness and supporting decision-making. However, the use of these technologies for heterogeneous types of users and roles in emergency management requires particular approaches. This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach. The proposed framework enhances emergency response operations mainly through: 1) The presentation of geospatial information in heterogeneous and interactive ways; 2) The management of aspects related to the health of First Responders and treatments of casualties of all kinds involved in the emergency; 3) The use of video as a key enabler in decision-making; and 4) Multimodal interaction capabilities to help handle the information with less intrusive ways. We present the set of components that compose this framework running on different types of hardware devices and describe their applicability in multiple challenging situations in collaboration with a larger set of tools.},

  abstract={In recent years eXtended Reality (XR) technologies have matured and have become affordable, yet creating XR experiences for training and learning in many cases is still a time-consuming and costly process, hindering widespread adoption. One factor driving effort is that content and features commonly required by many applications get re-implemented for each experience, instead of sharing and reusing these resources by means of a common platform. In this paper we present two XR experiences in the context of informal learning and first responder training along with the shared platform they have been created with and the creation process. Furthermore, we have technically evaluated relevant parts of the platform for feasibility of use with experience requirements and confirmed ap-plicability. Finally, we present an informal expert evaluation of the content creation process's user experience for the informal learning experience along with guidelines derived from the findings.},

  abstract={In this work we present ARTTS: a head-worn Augmented Reality (AR) Triage Tool Suite containing an initial sorting tool, virtual assessment tool, and virtual triage tag to assist emergency responders in mass casualty incidents. The initial sorting tool can prompt novice responders through first-wave tasks to aid recalibration from shock to triage. The virtual assessment tool provides novice responders, potentially confused by the chaos, with a walkthrough of the SALT triage flowchart. Finally, current emergency medical triage processes leverage static paper tags susceptible to loss or illegible damage. ARTTS’ virtual triage tags are dynamic, can be updated through responder interaction, and employ user interface emergent features based on individual patient conditions. This paper describes ARTTS’ capabilities, as well as the applied user-centered design process including review of existing triage material, subject-matter expert interview transcripts, wireframing, application of usability and user-centered design principles, as well as iterative usability subject-matter expert assessments and design walkthroughs. The ARTTS user experience aims to enhance, not upend, existing triage processes. Finally, this paper provides a usability evaluation comparing ARTTS’ virtual triage tag to a physical paper triage tag. Our tag achieved requisite System Usability Scale (SUS) scores and showed negligible differences to the paper triage tag on usability and mental workload.},

  abstract={The protective equipment equipped by firefighters is more and more advanced, but the sacrifice rate of firefighters in the fire fighting task is increasing year by year. For the designer of fire protective clothing, how to make a balance between protection and portability is a difficult choice. There is an obvious upward trend of accidental casualties among firefighters when they perform fire fighting tasks. For this reason, a multi-sensor intelligent wearable device vital signs monitoring system for firefighters is proposed in this paper. The control center of the designed system can know the information such as the number and names of firefighters on duty through the personnel positioning within the scope of each detachment, and realize the attendance management of firefighters. Includes system acceleration sensor, heart rate sensor, temperature and smoke sensor. The system can monitor the physical health, movement state and position information of firefighters in real time, and provide remote interactive function, which is convenient for the command center to issue instructions and push the auxiliary decision information, thus realizing the intelligent management of firefighters and improving their combat level.},

  abstract={Fire fighting remains a dangerous profession despite many recent technological and organizational measures. Sensors and technical systems can augment the performance of fire fighters and increase safety and efficiency during operation. An important aspect in that context is the awareness of location, structure and thermal properties of the environment. This work focuses on the design and development of a mobile system, which can reconstruct a 3d model of a building's interior structure in real-time and fuses the visualization with the image of a thermal camera. In addition, the position and viewing direction of the fire fighter within the model is determined and a thermal map can be generated from the gathered data. This helps an operational commander to provide accurate instructions to his men during a mission. First tests with our system in different situations showed good results, being able to reconstruct different larger scenes and create thermal maps thereof.},

  pages={2549-2553},
  abstract={In this study we investigate the effects of medium disturbances on the usability of a biomimetic sonar system in a target localization application. In particular, we concentrate on a fire-fighting application giving rise to specific types of medium disturbances. We determine experimentally the effects of these medium disturbances: undisturbed air (reference), the presence of small water droplets, large convective air-currents and flames, on the received echo spectra. As the echo spectra are used to estimate the target location, these different conditions by disturbing to varying extents sound propagation through the medium will have an effect on the sonar system's localization performance. Using an information theoretic model of the spectrum based localization mechanism we characterize the loss in localization accuracy due to the different medium disturbances. We conclude that an echolocation system based on the sonar system of the bat Phyllostomus discolor allows for robust localization even in highly disturbed media. However, while the need for replacing the emission pattern of the bat by that of a standard transducer in the biomimetic sonar system makes little difference in the ‘reference’ and ‘water spray’ conditions it limits echolocation performance in the ‘air-currents’ condition and makes the use of the proposed system very difficult in the ‘flames’ condition.},

The safety jacket provides many functionalities to a firefighter at task. The embedded heat sensors measured the skin temperature of the firefighter, the room temperature, and that of all inanimate objects, such as walls, doors, and ceilings. An alert was given if a potential fire was hidden behind these objects. The gas sensor measured the level of carbon monoxide (CO), combustible gases, and smoke in the room. A warning signal would also be generated if the gas level became hazardous. A wireless radio module was attached to the jacket to facilitate team communication. The safety jacket would also alert firefighters of any obstacles ahead to avoid collision. In case a firefighter fell suddenly, a message would be sent to the external base to request for help. Sensitivity tests revealed the accuracy, the complexity, and performance of the prototype.},

  pages={234-241 Vol. 1},
  abstract={In response to requirements by the Counter Terrorism Tactical Support Office's, (CTTSO), Technical Support Working Group, (TSWG), a Tactical Rebreather, called "TACR" was designed and built by ESS of CA and O2 Dive Technologies of TX, under contract with TPI of MA. The increasing threat of international and domestic terrorism has expanded the need for protective equipment within and beyond traditional boundaries. Tactical security, law enforcement and other response units are sometimes required to enter or transit an area which may be contaminated with toxic industrial chemicals, fire by-products or chemical or biological agents. Depending on the situation, it may not be acceptable or operationally suitable for the personnel to use 'open loop' or negative pressure filtered respirators due to the nature of the contaminant or even its physical state (e.g. super heated air). In these situations a CBR is required. TACR - or TACtical Rebreather, is capable of 180 minutes of life support, is economically small, lightweight (weighing less then 20 lbs.), rapidly donnable, low cost, and interface with existing full-face masks with standard NATO interfaces. Additionally, it is to be easy to maintain, and have a short training period for first responders. Besides these fundamental requirements, TSWG provided valuable meetings with field first responders so that their various needs were also incorporated into the design. TACR is a CBR unit and is expected to go on for NIOSH testing and approval. Its many design features allow it to be adapted for all capabilities including meeting NFPA requirements of passive alarm and heads up display. Further adaptations will include environmental HAZMET "bunny" suits and other rigorous environments and applications. This device will be of commercial interest to DOD/SOCOM, FBI, and USSS, other federal, state and local Law Enforcement Agencies, fire fighters, urban and rural rescue teams and industrial First Responders. The TACR unit and ADAR second stage regulator, and all components herein are prototype proprietary by ESS and O2 Dive Technologies. This unit is currently not for sale.},

  pages={3385-3390 vol.4},
  abstract={This paper describes the head mounted display (HMD) system which can capture and display images with high reality. Conventional HMD has the disadvantages of small screen size and low resolution. Therefore, the resolution is not high enough for telerobotics applications which need real environment images with high reality. In order to address these problems, an eye movement tracking type head mounted display (EMT-HMD) is being developed. The EMT-HMD can display wide viewing angle and high resolution images of the environment. The theory is that a small, high resolution image is displayed at view point of the operator and a wide, low resolution image is displayed at the periphery. Human can see an object as a high resolution image only near the view point. Therefore, the operator who wears the EMT-HMD can feel that the displayed image is wide view angle and high resolution. In this paper, an image capturing system of real environment images is discussed. Next, some evaluation experiments for displaying real environment images are introduced using an EMT-HMD system and an image capturing system.},

  abstract={Nowadays, time is a very valuable resource and can make the difference between life and death. Having knowledge about this fact we decided to deal with one of the most important aspects of contemporary medicine, EMS (emergency medical services) response time. Modern systems that encourage intelligent communication methods between medical devices and doctors are a must in ubiquitous health care environments. Auxilum Medicine fosters a triple-win situation regarding the relationship between medical institutions, doctors and patients. Emergency patients should be treated with utmost care because their life is hanging by a thread if nobody is present to take immediate action. We are presenting a platform which enables doctors to simultaneously monitor a large number of patients from different physical locations. By receiving real time notifications, medical history, prevention alarms directly to any network connected devices (mobile phones, tablets, desktops, notebooks, smart watches, etc.), the medical staff can act promptly, exactly when and where it is needed in order to save human lives. Our solution's architecture allows gathering data from any medical signal processing unit and sends it straight to the cloud using encrypted communication protocols. What makes Auxilum Medicine unique refers to the cloud integration with hospital departments' structure, awareness of different medical staff roles and capabilities, privacy data interest, updates sent to patient's relatives as well as a modern responsive adaptive user interface. As a part of our experiment, aimed for testing our platform's capabilities, we have built a biomedical wireless sensor wearable device that provides real-time parameters (temperature and heart rate). Such a system favors medical equipment real time monitoring by using cloud services and permanently keeps alive the link between doctors and their patients, drastically increasing the EMS response time.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={In response to requirements by OceanWorks International, a Rescue Rebreather, called "SubPack" was designed and built by O2 Dive Technologies of TX, under contract for the REMORA rescue submarine for the Australian Navy. Operational requirements sometimes required entering or transiting an area, which may be contaminated with toxic industrial chemicals, fire by-products or chemical or biological agents. Depending on the situation, it may not be acceptable or operationally suitable for the personnel to use 'open loop' or negative pressure filtered respirators due to the nature of the contaminant or even its physical state (e.g. super heated air). In these situations a closed circuit breathing system is required. SubPack Rebreather, is capable of 180 minutes of life support, is ergonomically small, lightweight (weighing less then 20 lbs.), rapidly donnable, low cost, and interface with existing full-face masks with standard NATO interfaces. Additionally, it is to be easy to maintain, and have a short training period for first responders. Besides these fundamental requirements, OceanWorks provided valuable meetings that their various needs were also incorporated into the design. SubPack is a closed circuit rebreather unit and is expected to go on for NIOSH testing and approval. Its many design features allow it to be adapted for all capabilities including meeting NFPA requirements of passive alarm and heads up display. A second unit was designed and built to meet Long duration, high exertion, and environment. Originally, designed for search and rescue for miners, the Miners Rescue ReBreather System has a low breathing resistance, no aftermarket requirements for gas cooling and has six hour duration. Further adaptations will include and other rigorous environments and applications. This device will be of commercial interest to DOD/SOCOM, FBI, and USSS, other federal, state and local Law Enforcement Agencies, fire fighters, urban and rural rescue teams and industrial First Responders. The SubPack unit, and all components herein are prototype proprietary O2 Dive Technologies Inc.},

  abstract={With the aim of offering services and products that ensure the safety of people and properties, public safety organizations are responsible for providing the first responders, i.e., police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical service workers, with devices and communication systems that help them exchange time-sensitive and critical information. To address the mission-critical requirements and to target new broadband public safety applications, these organizations started migrating from traditional land mobile radio towards cellular communication systems with the consideration of a new set of deployed devices, such as wearables. In this paper, we first provide a state of the art overview of the features that are introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and that can be used for public safety services. Second, we discuss the role of wearable devices, more precisely cellular-enabled wearables, in creating several new use cases as part of the concept of the Internet of Life Saving Things. Finally, we conduct a performance evaluation of a mission-critical service using cellular-enabled wearables, specifically a mission-critical push-to-talk (MCPTT) application using LTE Cat-M2-enabled smartwatches. In this evaluation, we examine the impact of different parameters related to the wearable device capabilities and the MCPTT call scenarios on the key performance indicator defined by 3GPP for this type of applications, which is the MCPTT access time.},

  abstract={While responding to a disaster, emergency responders and managers make critical decisions based on limited available information. These decisions are critical for public safety and disaster recovery operation. There are many Decision Support Systems (DSS) available to assist the emergency responder community. Most current systems rely on continued availability of basic infrastructure such as electricity and communication networks, they may not be able to support emergency operations if there is loss of power and/or communication infrastructure. This paper considers a generalized scalable computing framework for Emergency Response DSS (ERDSS) designed to support emergency response operations even if a disaster causes disruptions to the power and communication infrastructure. It should operate at multiple scales of power consumption, network connectivity/bandwidth and computing resources. This framework would support (1.) a large computing system for emergency response planning (2.) laptop/tablet computers for on-site response management and (3.) handheld/ wearable device used in the field by the emergency responders. This framework will provide a unified, user-interface across different devices with the ability to optimize the use of available energy, computing capacity and communication resources to support the users.},

  pages={365-372},
  abstract={Emergency medical service (EMS) systems are public services that provide quick response, transportation as well as appropriate emergency medical care to the emergent patient. For EMS, every second is critical. Unfortunately, current EMS systems have many challenges: lack effective communication between EMS providers and hospital professionals, less attention on care quality and limited resources of medical equipment and personnel. Motivated by this, in this paper, we explore the use of wearable sensing, smart mobile device as well as video technology to propose STREMS: an efficient smart real-time prehospital communication system for EMS. Specifically, we first introduce a cost-effective wearable physiological sensing solution to support multi-dimensional telemetry monitoring for an ambulance operating at as Basic Life Support, a type of EMS service level without sophisticated medical equipment or paramedics. Then we propose to build a cloud-based real-time data sharing platform, enabling automated streaming all gathered prehospital data (e.g., vital signs, EKG and image/short videos about accident scene) to the hospital prior to ambulance arrival, thus giving a more complete figure about the incoming patient. This can significantly decrease the handoff time and improve the efficiency at the hospital. Additionally, a live point to point video communication is proposed to support EMS telemedicine to enhance prehospital care quality through directly video conversation to assist EMS providers in consultation, triage, early medical examination and treatment. We implemented STREMS as an Android mobile app and evaluated its feasibility over the broadband cellular network in the city of Detroit. In a moving context, our results demonstrate STREMS can successfully deliver 100% of emergency data to the hospital in less than 1.5s, on average 0.75s for reporting a new case and 0.05s for health data. As the live video with 1280×720 pixel resolution, STREMS only works when the vehicle speed is less than 40MPH.},

  pages={354-359 vol.1},
  abstract={This paper describes a head mounted display that can present images with high reality. The head mounted display (HMD) is often used on tele-robotics systems as visual presentation equipment. In such a tele-robotics system, an operator works on the basis of visual information presented by the HMD. In order to work precisely, high reality images are demanded. In order to present high reality images, a wide view angle and high resolution images need to be presented. But in conventional HMDs the field of view is narrow or the resolution is low, because of the restriction of the scanning line of a display. For that reason, the usage is limited. In order to solve those problems, we are developing the eye movement tracking type HMD (EMT-HMD) that can present the wide view angle and high resolution images of the environment although conventional displays are used. The principle is that a small image of high resolution is present in a narrow range of view point and present a wide image of low resolution in the perimeter by using two displays. In this paper, we examine a system which tracks the movement of eyes in a two dimensional range. The structure of a trial production system is explained. Also some evaluation experiments are introduced.},

  abstract={This paper describes a head mounted display (HMD) which can present visual images with high reality using the characteristics of the human eye. The HMD has received considerable attention as vision presentation equipment for virtual reality or telerobotics. However conventional HMDs have problems that those images are narrow view angle and low resolution, because those displays have a fixed number of scanning lines. In order to improve it, an eye movement tracking type HMD (EMT-HMD) was proposed. The EMT-HMD can present wider view angle and higher resolution compared with the conventional HMDs, though conventional display devices are used. The principle is that a small high resolution image is superimposed on a wide low resolution image using two conventional display devices. A small, high resolution image is presented at small area around the view point according to the output of the eye movement detector. On the other hand, a wide, low resolution image is presented at its peripheral wide area. In this paper, the structure which can track eye movement in 2-dimension is discussed. Then, the structure of the trial production system, is explained. Also, some evaluation experiments are be introduced to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed idea.},

  abstract={The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) program in Oman is just getting its feet off the ground at the moment. The EMS system, which is commonly utile-utilized countries that are a part of the Anglo-American region, was utilized in the process of producing it. Currently, the Royal Oman Police (ROP) Ambulance Division is responsible for the operation of this facility. It is run by Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians who have credentials from Oman (AEMT). In this study, the data from the EMS system were subjected to an IOMT analysis. The system, which was created to handle medical and trauma crises concurrently, covers the majority of the nation. Plans call for adding air medical services in addition to the current ground ambulance service as part of the country-wide expansion of the current ground ambulance service. The results of this study demonstrate that technology can assist in the remote monitoring of a variety of cardiovascular illnesses (CVDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure (CHF), as well as the discomfort and stress brought on by these ailments. E-textile sensors that were sewed into garments were used to assist in electrocardiogram analysis (ECG). An electrocardiogram is a piece of paper that depicts the electrical activity of the heart (ECG). Both the depolarization that takes place during the atrial and ventricular cardiac muscles' contraction and the repolarization that takes place during their relaxation can be captured by an ECG. E-textile sensors that can be sewed into clothing are now the most innovative technology available to the healthcare industry. There are many different kinds of wearable E-textiles on the market right now. Among other things, these E-textiles may regulate temperature, emit light, and react to touch. Wet Ag/AgCI1 electrodes or electrodes coated with silver and graphene ink were used in this investigation on a total of 100 patients as comparison electrodes. It is advised to use a band-pass filter and a notch filter to do additional processing on the collected ECG data. It has been advised to do this. At this time, the identities of the MSE, SNR, and PRD are all known. In the end, the Fisher approach for feature selection was used to choose eight characteristics for the model. The CVD scenarios were divided into categories and categorized using the KNN classification method.},

The aim of the presented research project is the user-centered implementation of an XR training for various occupational groups and volunteers of first responder organizations (e.g., physicians, paramedics, health care workers, police officers, firefighters). To achieve this aim, the project has followed three implementation steps: First, multi-stakeholder workshops were conducted to define two use cases for the most promising application areas. Second, based on the previous step, identified use cases were implemented as XR training scenarios. Third, scientific evaluations of the training applications are conducted focusing on subjective and objective performance indicators, learning success, training experience, acceptance, and potential barriers from an end-user perspective. As the last step is still ongoing, this paper puts emphasis on the outcomes of the stakeholder workshops, the respective decisions taken towards selecting two use cases, and the design of the evaluation study.},

  abstract={Emergency response, navigation, and evacuation are key essentials for effective rescue and safety management. Situational awareness is a key ingredient when fire responders or emergency response personnel responds to an emergency. They have to quickly assess the layout of a building or a campus upon entry. Moreover, the occupants of a building or campus also need situational awareness for navigation and emergency response. We have developed an integrated situational awareness mobile augmented reality (AR) application for smart campus planning, management, and emergency response. Through the visualization of integrated geographic information systems and real-time data analysis, our mobile application provides insights into operational implications and offers information to support effective decision-making. Using existing building features, the authors demonstrate how the mobile AR application provides contextualized 3D visualizations that promote and support spatial knowledge acquisition and cognitive mapping thereby enhancing situational awareness. A limited user study was conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed mobile AR application using the mobile phone usability questionnaire (MPUQ) framework. The results show that the mobile AR application was relatively easy to use and that it can be considered a useful application for navigation and evacuation.},

  abstract={Situational Awareness (SA) and managing workload are key factors in aerial firefighting, also known as Air Attack. Training for Air Attack is logistically challenging, risky, expensive, and difficult to practise in naturalistic settings. Simulation training in Virtual Reality (VR) has good potential to mitigate these challenges. This paper explored the application of VR Air Attack training with two multisensory immersive display types, an Oculus Rift CV1 VR Head Mounted Display (HMD) and a 270° Cylindrical Projection Display (CPD). Firefighters training to become Air Support Supervisors were recruited to participate in the study. SA, workload, and sense of presence in the virtual environment were measured. Qualitative data on the firefighters’ user experience and their subjective evaluation of the systems were also collected. This was to gain insights on the suitability of the two systems for Air Attack training, and whether the new systems were an improvement on earlier designs. The results show that the participants experienced a high level of SA, workload and presence in both conditions, with a direct comparison tentatively suggesting that the HMD system invoked slightly higher SA, greater overall presence and lower workload. The collected qualitative data suggest that the participating firefighters appreciated both systems for their realism, extensibility, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. In particular participants noted that the virtual experience facilitated their understanding of the Air Attack role, and they recommended the use of virtual reality simulation training to supplement existing Air Attack training.},

TeleHealth can partially fulfill this area of healthcare. TeleHealth and Telemedicine are broadly refer to healthcare services that provide medical information or healthcare across distances, providing patients with access to locally unavailable medical services or even substituting entirely for face-to-face contact with physicians in emergencies. Many writers prefer the term “TeleHealth” for broad applications such as education and dissemination of health information, and telemedicine for provision of medical services to patients. There are many healthcare technologies which have been implemented around the globe. Amongst these technologies, very few are used for an emergency case. In this paper we are going to introduce TeleHealth Emergency (THE) System which is not yet implemented anywhere which is based on Locate-Diagnose-Move technique. THE system is the collaboration of GSM/GPRS, GPS, sensors (wearable device) and P2P technology. This system is initially proposed for the emergency movement and diagnoses the roaming heart (Cardiac) patients as well as accidental victim. The main aim of THE system is to provide urgent provisional medication and movement of patient to the hospital which can save lives of many before the contact of expert doctors. This system can be implemented in urban areas of India immediately because of the availability of hospitals, health clinics, ambulances and specialist too.},

Iot consists of various sensors and communication devices which are necessary tools for IOT based health monitoring systems. Among the various applications that Internet of Things (IoT) facilitated to the world, Health care and Health monitoring applications are most important. It also responded if any medical emergency was needed. IoT (Internet of Things) has brought a remarkable approach in healthcare during the global pandemic. The remote health surveillance monitors certain parameters of a patient using digital technology and allows a correct evaluation of health right at home. This brilliant internet revolution has not only minimized patient movement during COVID but also ensured smart healthcare for all ages. IoT heads to set up a strategic connection between the patient & the doctors. The goal is to track the important health parameters such as - Blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose level etc. and evaluate the data to figure out any sort of medical emergency. From diagnosing heart disease to finding ICU bed availability in the nearest hospitals, digital technology is all set to assist. Using certain medical sensor devices & web-based apps, the health data is passed to the portal from where concerned doctors can provide medical assistance. The data collection, transmission & visualization can use a smartphone as a hub, thus making the operation smooth & flexible. It is the most practical & economical solution to people of all ages while avoiding direct contact & preventing the spread of the virus. The wearable real-time health tracking devices privilege the elder citizen through continuous monitoring while ensuring immediate measures in case of emergency. In this paper, a review of IoT based smart health monitoring systems is presented. The latest innovative technologies used for IoT based smart health monitoring systems with their benefits and challenges have been discussed.

Bio Kin Cloud for data intensive computations and storage. The system is implemented as a web system and an android based mobile application. The web system communicates with the mobile application using an encrypted data structure containing sensor data and identifiable headings. The raw data, according to identifiable headings, is stored in the Amazon Relational Database Service which is automatically backed up daily.

  abstract={Given the currently fast evolution of wireless access technologies, high-performance mobile devices and wide variety of wearable medical sensors, electronic and mobile healthcare (eHealth and mHealth) services are receiving particular attention nowadays. Several mHealth application scenarios strongly rely on mobile or embedded devices interconnected with medical sensors via Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The vast majority of these services require strict medical level Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) provision. Emergency use-cases like remote patient monitoring, tele-consultation and guided surgical intervention demand real-time communication and appropriate connection quality during any mobility event. In many cases the mHealth WBANs are nested into other overlay access networks around the patient. To fulfil the quality requirements of such applications, during the various mobility scenarios not only a single mobile entity has to be considered, but also entire nested WBANs (moving between different networks) have to be taken into account. If network layer mobility management is required (like in case of inter-technology handovers under heterogeneous radio coverages), still NEMO Basic Support (RFC 3963) is the most common standardized approach to be implemented. Motivated by this, the paper investigates mobility management performance issues of NEMO-based nested WBANs. The evaluation is based on INET/OMNeT++ simulations and transport layer characteristics.},

  abstract={The emerging technology breakthrough of the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to offer promising solutions for indoor/outdoor healthcare, which may contribute significantly to human health and well-being. In this paper, we investigated the technologies of healthcare service applications in telemedicine architecture. We aimed to resolve a series of healthcare problems on the frequent failures in telemedicine architecture through IoT solutions, particularly the failures of wearable body sensors (Tier 1) and a medical center server (Tier 3). For improved generalisability, we demonstrated an effective research approach, the fault-tolerant framework on mHealth or the so-called FTF-mHealth-IoT in the context of IoT, to resolve essential problems in current investigations on healthcare services. First, we propose a risk local triage algorithm known as the risk-level localization triage (RLLT), which can exclude the control process of patient triage from the medical center by using mHealth and can warn about failures related to wearable sensors. RLLT performs this initial step towards detecting a patient's emergency case and then identifying the healthcare service package of the risk-level. Second, according to the risk-level package, our framework can aid decision makers in hospital selection through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). Accordingly, mHealth can connect directly with the servers of distributed hospitals to ascertain available healthcare services for the risk-level package in those hospitals. The time of arrival of the patient at the hospital (TAH) is considered for each hospital to reach a final decision and select the appropriate institution in case of medical center failure. This paper used two datasets. The first dataset involved 572 patients with chronic heart disease. Their triage levels were evaluated using our RLLT algorithm. The second dataset included hospital healthcare services with two levels of availability within distributed hospitals to show variety when testing the proposed framework. The former dataset is an actual dataset of services collected from 12 hospitals located in the capital Baghdad, which represents the maximum level of availability. The latter is an assumption dataset of the services within the 12 hospitals located in the capital Kuala Lumpur, which represents the minimum level of availability. Subsequently, the hospitals were prioritized using a unique MCDM method for estimating small power consumption, namely, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), based on a crossover between the “healthcare services package/TAH” of each hospital and the “hospital list”. The results showed that the AHP is effective for solving hospital selection problems within mHealth. The implications of this study support the patients, organizations, and medical staff in a modern lifestyle.},

  abstract={In this paper, we have studied ubiquitous personal healthcare systems using radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, smart card, PQRM Grid computing, PhysioNet, wired/wireless network, and public-key infrastructure (PKI) technologies. For research and development of these systems, we have also designed and modeled the system architecture and framework workflow, which are described by six classified core players or subsystems. They are consisting of the patient area network and wearable sensor provider, network service provider, healthcare service provider, emergency service provider, and PKI service providers, whose individual private and public keys should be stored on their smart card and be used to enhance security level control for the patient's medical privacy. All ECG measured data in wearable ECG sensor and analyzed data in Grid computing with PhysioNet should be encrypted by using an individually generated one-time secure key with expire-time by the patient's and healthcare service provider's private keys, respectively. These encrypted medical data and encrypted secure keys should be also transferred to the network service provider via secured communication channels in wired/wireless networks. In addition, these encrypted data and keys should be stored on the secured database directory of network service provider. Therefore, all of the patient and providers need suitable secure private and public keys in order to access to ECG medical raw data, diagnosis results and tracking information for emergency service.},

  abstract={In this paper we have explored the novel services that can be engendered with the use of Real Time Health Advice and Action (ReTiHA) through continuous monitoring of the patient for vital parameters, real time prognosis and medical advice. Our services are aimed at providing healthcare services in remote areas where rigid healthcare systems are unavailable through implementation of cost effective mechanisms. With the advent of wearable sensors, improved mobile communication technologies and powerful on-board processing capabilities in smart devices, the data collected from the patient and the surrounding environment can be utilized to monitor the patient for various anomalies ranging from a simple rise in body temperature to complex situations including organ failure. The data from sensors are processed on the device itself or sent to a remote server for computations depending on the amount of data handled and the level of emergency associated with the same. The patients are registered on the cloud with organized storage of medical history, vital parameters along with possible emergencies and symptoms. We have emphasized on the introduction of various value-added services in which the immediate family of the patient can receive real time updates, push notifications for medicinal intakes, feedback from patients as well as real time advice in times of emergency. These services are designed to reduce reaction time for an emergency allowing possible prediction of occurrence at a lower level of emergency for patients.},

Handheld displays and gauges can be virtually useless in an environment frequently characterized by zero visibility, and this has been a serious limitation to underwater manned diving operations [1]. Waveguide optical display technology has the potential to radically transform diver visual display systems by enabling the diver's face mask itself to become a see-through head-up display, similar to something from an Iron Man or Star Trek movie. Under a recent international government sponsored program, the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) developed a concept prototype binocular see-through head-up display inside a diver's full face mask using waveguide optical display technology. This paper will describe diver visual display systems, waveguide optical display technology, development of the concept prototype, results of diver evaluations, and recommendations for follow-on research and development.},

  abstract={Firefighting is a dynamic activity, in which numerous operations occur simultaneously. Maintaining situational awareness (i.e., knowledge of current conditions and activities at the scene) is critical to the accurate decision-making necessary for the safe and successful navigation of a fire environment by firefighters. Conversely, the disorientation caused by hazards such as smoke and extreme heat can lead to injury or even fatality. This research implements recent advancements in technology such as deep learning, point cloud and thermal imaging, and augmented reality platforms to improve a firefighter's situational awareness and scene navigation through improved interpretation of that scene. We have designed and built a prototype embedded system that can leverage data streamed from cameras built into a firefighter's personal protective equipment (PPE) to capture thermal, RGB color, and depth imagery and then deploy already developed deep learning models to analyze the input data in real time. The embedded system analyzes and returns the processed images via wireless streaming, where they can be viewed remotely and relayed back to the firefighter using an augmented reality platform that visualizes the results of the analyzed inputs and draws the firefighter's attention to objects of interest, such as doors and windows otherwise invisible through smoke and flames.},

Therefore, the quality of experience in medical media (QoEMM) services is quite important. This research optimizes the medical media service such as, electrocardiogram (ECG) for the elderly patients by adopting wearable devices with large screen. Due to small size, and resource-constrained nature of those handheld devices it is hard to satisfy the end user's perception while monitoring the elderly emergency patients. Besides, how the elderly patient's QoE during medical media ECG data transmission can be captured, for this purpose first, framework of QoEMM is developed by adopting acquisition time. Second, the relationship between subjective test score (i.e. surveyed data) and objective performance metrics (i.e., energy consumption and entropy) with acquisition time and actual time of ECG service is established. It is revealed through extensive real-time subjective data sets in experimental setup that QoEMM is optimized through portable devices, and correlated with QoS parameters during medical media ECG service to improve the satisfaction level of end-users.},

  abstract={In the state-of-the-art Command Center at the Morrelly Homeland Security Center in Bethpage NY, VCORE Solutions has integrated, demonstrated, tested, deployed, and is operating powerful Emergency Management Common Operating Picture Software/Systems (COPSS). This Regional COPSS demonstrates in an operational environment the next generation of emergency management situational awareness, command & control, and information sharing in a natural, easy to use and understand four-dimensional (4D) common operating picture. This Regional COPSS is based on patented fourDscape® software technology, developed over the past decade by Long Island, NY-based Balfour Technologies. This powerful fourDscape augmented virtual reality technology has been effectively applied to local and regional emergency management operations and can be deployed nationally to deliver comprehensive situational awareness in support of safety, security and emergency preparedness, prevention, mitigation, response and recovery operations at all levels. A fourDscape browser/server-based COPSS is designed as an open, multi-layered service/resource oriented networked architecture (SOA/ROA, i.e. “cloud”) capable of (1) integrating and managing a multitude of disparate data sources of all types (including live and static data feeds); (2) interoperability with numerous other vendors information systems, COPs, information sharing frameworks, notification and alerting systems, analytics, etc.; and (3) sharing and passing information and comprehensive, timely situational awareness between first responders at the incident site, incident commanders, and emergency managers and decision makers at local, regional and national emergency operations centers across the country. And consistent with the recent Presidential Policy Directive on National Preparedness (PPD-8), this fourDscape COPSS capabilities and framework represents currently operational technology that can achieve an integrated, layered, and all-of-Nation [capabilities-based] preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available resources. Next Generation COPSS such as fourDscape need to be open and scalable to facilitate global information sharing; deliver information in an easy-to-understand augmented virtual reality common operating picture; be easy-to-use walk-up technology with a full complement of embedded training/simulation capability; provide for effective information assurance; and be compliant and effective in executing national preparedness goals. All this can and will be achieved by next generation COPSS.},

In disaster situations, for first responder emergency services to communicate more effectively, the exchange of multimedia information (e.g. high-resolution images) could really help. Due to this fact, LTE technology is postulated as the choice for public safety broadband communication systems. In this paper, we examine a proposal based on two-hop links that seeks to reach locations with low or null coverage and to achieve a physical layer improvement. Such a solution is carried out by combining some LTE features provided by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with the use of a wearable massive MIMO solution formed by a large textile array directly implemented at the end user.},

The goal was to control a Jaguar V4 robot in a virtual environment using both joystick and voice commands, because not all functions could be accessed by hand controllers alone. The speech recognition was designed for English speakers. Firstly it was tested at MSU with five US participants and later the same tests were repeated with 16 students at TUKE, who were non-native English speakers.

Global aging is increasing as well as care costs are also rising. It is increasingly necessary to improve precocious disease detection and medical intervention. Wearable monitoring systems, along with wireless communications, form the basis of an emerging class of sensor networks. These information technologies enable the early detection of abnormal conditions and help in their prevention. The goal is to create one of these systems composed by a network of sensors that is implemented in a jacket through conductive wires with connected sensors. In contact with the human body it has the function of doing several readings, such as body temperature, heartbeat, among others. Another goal is to detect user falls. The detection of falls is increasingly important for the user, as it is a situation that can endanger peoples health. For the development of this concept, Mobile Communications and the Global Positioning System are used. The first is a technology that allows to create emergency calls in response to system alarms, the second indicates the geographical location. To complement the system there is an online platform that registers the position of the user as well as his data. There is also an alert area in which the user can check his alarming values. In case of emergency the system contacts the emergency services or in special cases help can be obtained through an UAV.},

The effectiveness and efficiency of the approach were evaluated using real-world floor plans, and the results were promising. The method has the potential to revolutionize the way architects and designers produce and present floor plans, providing a more immersive and interactive experience that can improve communication and collaboration among design teams. Clients can also benefit from this approach as it can assist them in comprehending and visualizing their designs.

  abstract={Disaster response efforts during natural or man-made disasters are often hampered by compromised communications (e.g., lack or outage of cellular coverage). This can create a dangerous lack of communication or reliance on ad hoc networks, stifling information sharing. Existing systems that target this compromised communication gap are often difficult to rapidly deploy, proprietary and not interoperable, or designed for military use. Additionally, for many first responders (law enforcement, fire, EMS, etc.), current airborne sensor and communication assets are expensive or unavailable. In response to this capability gap, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) has sponsored MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Pennsylvania State University to design and fabricate a low power, low weight, reliable communication prototype solution to provide essential information. The system design was driven by public safety data needs and operational constraints. The prototype system consists of wearable nodes that communicate via a repeater. Users can access the system using a standard 802.11 Wi-Fi access point. This paper describes the prototype system and its public safety design.},

  abstract={In this paper we introduce a Mixed Reality Triage and Evacuation game, MiRTE, that is used in the development, testing and training of Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) information systems for first responders. Using the Source game engine from Valve software, MiRTE creates immersive virtual environments to simulate various incident scenarios, and enables interactions between multiple players/first responders. What distinguishes it from a pure computer simulation game is that it can interface with external mass casualty incident management systems, such as DIORAMA. The game will enable system developers to specify technical requirements of underlying technology, and test different alternatives of design. After the information system hardware and software are completed, the game can simulate various algorithms such as localization technologies, and interface with an actual user interface on PCs and Smartphones. We implemented and tested the game with the DIORAMA system.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of elderly population is a global concern and a burden on healthcare services as special health challenges appear for this segment of the population. An innovative way of patient monitoring is possible due to the recent advancements in electronics that have emerged with a number of devices which can provide continuous, real time remote healthcare monitoring to the patients even if they are freely moving around and not in hospital beds. The constant miniaturization of these electronic devices has made it possible to wear these sensors either on the clothing or body or even implanted inside the body. An unprecedented growth of smart phones and Internet technology all over the world would be a boon in this area. The recorded information, sent by these wearable sensors can be collected locally using some PDA or mobile phone. These collected medical data values may be analyzed in brief against the stored threshold values using an app on the mobile phone in real time. Collective Information may be transmitted to a centralized server periodically or immediately in case of emergency medical response required in life critical situations. The submitted medical information is used for clinical diagnosis & experts' advice and long term storage in healthcare database for future references. In this paper we discuss architecture of the Healthcare System and asses the security issues and privacy concerns while collecting patient medical data from sensors to mobile device and further submitting this data to the centralized server. The security and privacy protection of sensitive and private patient medical data is a major unsolved concern and a break into the system is possible. We also discuss the other challenges in the implementation of WBAN and provide a conclusion.},

  abstract={Urban gun violence in cities across the world is a serious issue for public safety agencies and disaster management organizations. This led us to the development of the EDNA drone, an aerial robotics solution designed to equip first responders in high-risk settings with lifesaving-edge tools for situational awareness and non-lethal conflict resolution. The EDNA is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that delivers the patent-pending “Predictive Probable Cause” technology. The EDNA drone is designed to provide automated real-time analysis to assist teams entering high-risk situations where gun violence may occur. By leveraging machine learning, biometric sensors, and advanced materials in the field and routing feedback to an intuitive augmented-reality interface, the EDNA will provide autonomous threat detection and bullet-stopping capabilities wherever those features are needed--to groups such as Police and Sheriff's Departments, Fire Departments, and EMT and emergency rescue teams. Data from the EDNA drone's sensors is fed to machine learning algorithms running on the drone in real-time. Through a neural network trained on past data, the EDNA is able to detect the presence and location of firearms and explosives, even through walls or other obstacles. Through the use of advanced metal foams and composite materials, the armored drone can even stop bullets-functionality which has obvious benefits for humanitarian deployment.},

Such devices are critical for early detection of emergency conditions of people at risk and offer a wide range of medical facilities and services. Despite continuous advances in the field of wearable and implantable medical devices, it still faces major challenges such as energy-efficient and low-latency reconstruction of signals. This work presents a power-efficient real-time system for recovering neural signals. Such systems are of high interest for implantable medical devices, where reconstruction of neural signals needs to be done in realtime with low energy consumption. We combine a deep network and DCT-Iearning based compressive sensing framework to propose a novel and efficient compression-decompression system for neural signals. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art compressive sensing methods and show that it achieves superior reconstruction performance with significantly less computing time.},

However, as the number of sensors in a wearable device increases together with continuous monitoring and wireless communications, the battery lifetime and battery duration per charge becomes a major concern. This issue is particularly important for health monitoring of workers operating in difficult environments such as emergency response responders, mining and construction. In this paper, we present a wireless charging system for a health monitoring smart-wear application of workers by considering the power consumption requirements of sensory hardware, communication technology as well as the practical charging scenarios. We also demonstrate a working prototype of a 5-Watt wireless charging device used by our health monitoring wearable. Our paper provides the design, analysis of the requirements and the critical factors of a `wireless charging bin' that we are currently prototyping for our application context.},

Maintaining cognitive control under these circumstances is a necessary condition to perform efficient decision making for the purpose of own health and to pursue mission objectives. We are aiming at developing biosensor-based decision support for risk stratification on cognitive readiness of first responders at the mission site. In a first development stage, an exploratory pilot study was performed to test a formalized reporting schema applying equivalent stress in real, non-immersive and fully immersive training environments. Wearable psychophysiological measurement technology was applied to estimate the cognitive-emotional stress level under both training conditions. In this work we particularly focus on the potential of predicting the risk level for failures in situation awareness from digital analysis of cognitive-emotional stress. The results provide statistically significant indications for risk stratification of cognitive readiness based on situation awareness theory.},

The first responders are requested to explore unknown and potentially hazardous environments, risking their own well-being in order to save others. New innovative technologies are essential to support the first responders in their tasks, ensuring their safety and the effectiveness of their operations. These technologies, that may include wearable devices, automated vehicles and drones or back-end services require communications in order to operate in full capacity. Available infrastructure often fails in cases of emergency, while some operational environments may not even support them to begin with. Aiming to alleviate this barrier, a resilient, field deployable system, that can support the communication between all the equipment deployed at the field and multiple backhaul networks is presented here. The design of the communications, the hardware solutions that support the design as well as the selected configurations are discussed in detail.},

  abstract={Firefighters rely on visual information to make tactical decisions during structure fire events. Consequently, user interface design for public safety requires a comprehensive understanding of how these visual cues impact performance in terms of expertise and domain knowledge, as well as cognitive load. However, very few studies have captured baseline measures (e.g., subjective workload) associated with the use of pre-incident planning, the phase prior to deciding how to extinguish the fire. Virtual environments and 3D modeling have been suggested as a tool that can better support the exploration of emerging technology to better support pre-incident planning practices. Sixty-four (n = 64) North American firefighters participated in this study. Our work focuses on providing baseline data to define effective ways to present building and hazard information to incident commanders using both current systems (e.g., 2D diagrams) and emerging technologies (e.g., 3D models, virtual reality, augmented reality).},

  abstract={Perpetual IoT systems are essential to many safety and mission-critical applications, e.g. assisted living, healthcare and public safety, which are characterized by continuous monitoring (24/7) and ubiquitous sensing. While IoT-enabled many applications and services, several limitations arise in operating IoT deployments in a resilient manner over time; challenges include the energy cost and constraints. In our research, we aim to handle energy challenges caused by perpetual operations in each level of the system architecture (device, communication, and processing). We use a semantic approach that utilizes context of extracted activities of daily living (ADLs) and indoor space-state (normal, anomaly, and emergency) to drive energy optimized sensor activations. In addition, we are uniquely leveraging features such as: heterogeneity of IoT devices (wearable, ambient, and vision) in terms of: energy cost, energy source (battery-operated and wall-powered IoT devices), processing capability, mobility, communication technologies and transmission protocol (NB-IoT, LTE-M, LoRa, Wi-Fi, 4G/5G, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.), processing location (device, edge, could). To validate our approach, we developed an elderly fall detection system using multi-personal and in-situ sensing IoT devices derived from real-world deployments; using our measurements to drive larger simulations. We show that our proposed algorithms such as, Cost-Function-Gradient can achieve greater than 4X reductions in energy dissipation and doubling system-lifetime without loss of sensing accuracy.},

  abstract={Virtual Reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) have been studied widely as tools for the most diverse kinds of training activities. One particular kind that is the basis for many real-world applications is spatial knowledge acquisition and navigation. For example, knowing well by heart escape routes can be an important factor for firefighters and soldiers. Prior research on how well knowledge acquired in virtual worlds translates to the real, physical one has had mixed results, with some suggesting spatial learning in VR is akin to using a regular 2D display. However, VR HMDs have evolved drastically in the last decade, and little is known about how spatial training skills in a simulated environment using up-to-date VR HMDs compare to training in the real world. In this paper, we investigate how people trained in a VR maze compare against those trained in a physical maze in terms of recall of the position of items inside the environment. While our results did not find significant differences in time performance for people who experienced the physical and those who trained in VR, other behavioral factors were different.},

  abstract={The design of control and protection system of the line-commutated converter (LCC) in a meticulous way should consider both dynamics of the LCC and large-scale ac grids. Consequently, a highly accurate and efficient simulation method is desirable. In order to capture the high-frequency dynamics between ac/dc grids, the multirate and mixed solver based cosimulation by combining transient stability (TS), shifted-frequency phasor (SFP), and electromagnetic transient (EMT) models is proposed. The idea of the proposed multirate and mixed solver based cosimulations is to naturally decouple the whole system into the respective TS, EMT, and SFP subsystems. The accuracy of the proposed multirate cosimulation is guaranteed by the proposed interface models, i.e., the TS-SFP interface model (TS-SFP-IM) and the SFP-EMT interface model (SFP-EMT-IM). The efficiency is guaranteed by the natural partitioning strategy, decoupled manner based communication structure and the overall realization of time sequence. The performance of the proposed multirate cosimulation has been validated on practical ac/dc system in China.},

Staying cognitively under control under these circumstances is a necessary condition to avoid useless risk-taking and particularly to provide accurate situation reports to organize appropriate support in time. This work-in-progress applied a flexible virtual reality (VR) training environment to investigate the performance of reporting under rather realistically simulated mission conditions. In a pilot study, representative emergency forces of the Austrian volunteer fire brigade and paramedics of the Johanniter organization participated in an exploratory pilot study that tested a formalized reporting schema (LEDVV), applying equivalent stress in both, (i) real (physical strain) and non-immersive (cognitive strain), and (ii) fully immersive training environments. Wearable psychophysiological measuring technology was applied to estimate the cognitive-emotional stress level under both training conditions. The results indicate that situation reports achieve a high level of cognitive-emotional stress and should be thoroughly trained. Furthermore, the results motivate the use of VR environments for the training of stress-resilient decision-making behavior of emergency forces.},

This paper presents an AR application that provides real-time information for campus exploration incorporating Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). Many mobile AR applications have been developed for campus tours to help new students and visitors identify campus buildings and their services. However, from the User Experience (UX) design perspective, simply providing general information about each building may not be sufficient for students who need specific information based on their backgrounds and particular needs. The mobile AR application, TWUExplorAR, presented in this paper, incorporates the concept of EDI by overlaying the landmark information tailored to each user’s background and needs, thus improving UX. The paper outlines the background and related work, describes the development of the AR application, illustrates the incorporation of EDI in the application, summarizes the usability tests, and suggests future improvements.},

  pages={70-78},
  abstract={Emergency response in indoor building evacuation is essential for effective rescue and safety management. First responders often lack the situational awareness capability to quickly assess the layout of a building upon initial entry. For occupants of the building, situational awareness becomes more important in cases of active shooter events or circumstances of fire and smoke. One of the challenges is to provide user-specific personalized evacuation routes in real-time. In multilevel building environments, the complexity of the architecture creates problems for both visual and mental representation of the 3D spaces. This paper presents three cutting edge Augmented Reality Instructional (ARI) modules that overcome the visual limitations associated with the traditional, static 2D methods of communicating evacuation plans for multilevel buildings. Using existing building features, the authors demonstrate how the three modules provide contextualized 3D visualizations that promote and support spatial knowledge acquisition and cognitive mapping thereby enhancing situational awareness. These ARI visualizations are developed for first responders and building occupants to help increase emergency preparedness and mitigate the evacuation related risks in multilevel building rescues and safety management. Specifically, the paper describes the design and implementation of the ARI modules and reports the results of the pilot studies conducted to evaluate their perceived usefulness, ease-of-use, and usability. The results suggest the desirability of further heuristic examination of three-dimensional situational awareness-based ARI application effectiveness in multilevel building evacuations.},

With wireless technology on the platform, patient can go outside for common life, instead of being tied at home or hospital. Another advantage to use an Android phone as a hub is its computing power. We can put several light-weighted monitoring functions in the phone to provide important services such as emergency alarm and location information. After the mobile hub, we transmit the data onto our cloud server. The server in the cloud can analyze recorded ECG signal in more details with accurate algorithms and advanced analysis. Therefore, cloud server plays an important role in the platform that let the whole system has diagnostic grade. The demonstration can show how the whole platform works. On one hand, an Android phone/ tablet will be used to monitor the ECG waveform in real time. In addition, the application on the Android device can provide some valuable services we mentioned above. On the other hand, a Windows laptop will be use to show the analyzed results of the cloud server. Further more, we also plan to demo the cloud server by using browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera). This can reveal that, our platform can apply to every operation system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android). Incidentally, the sensor and the application program are very low power. Hence users can monitor their ECG continuously for 24 hours by a wearable sensor (half of the credit card size) and their general Android phones.},

  abstract={Increasing demand for secure remote operation in industry and technology advancements to support delivering efficient services and tele-mentoring have opened a new market in healthcare sector and emergency services based on 5G and Tactile internet capabilities. In a connected world, hospitals would benefit from providing the on-time availability either for continuous health monitoring or critical services to the citizens in need. In this paper, we propose a secure non-public health enterprise network concept to enable an end-to-end secure and location-agnostic communication between a patient and a healthcare service provider, and other contacts with patient's consent either in case of an emergency or to be stored in the medical records. We present how applying non-public enterprise networks can address market demand in health care sector for improved end-to-end security and privacy when dealing with personal and critical information. We present the three-tier architecture model describing continuous authentication mechanisms based on biometric collection as well as the dynamic network solutions in the healthcare domain. The biometric collection can be done using ambient/IoT sensors as well as wearable/implantable devices to monitor the patient unobtrusively. Furthermore, end-to-end security solutions should adapt dynamically based on the user profile and situation awareness to address the required level of security at the network side. We discuss the related research challenges for developing the presented non-public health enterprise platform and provide suggestions for future work based on the healthcare sector requirements and opportunities.},

  abstract={The main aim of this paper is to provide intensive solution for heart attack through Cyber Physical System (CPS). Cyber Physical System is one of the blooming technologies with wide range of applications. Currently the interest towards design and implementation of CPS is highly increasing. It is expected that CPS will play a vital role in the progress of upcoming embedded systems. In this paper we have proposed a system to provide efficient and quick solution to heart attack patients who are at great risk. Advancement in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has created an enormous impact on the current medical health care scenario. It has enabled the design of small sized wireless communication systems at low cost. A small wearable wireless monitoring system inspects the patient's ECG signals continuously and transmits the signals to decision making and control systems. The control system is capable of controlling the actuation system which is fitted to the body of the patients. The warning system sends an alert in case of emergency to the caretakers mobile. Our proposed system uses low cost, energy efficient and reliable zigbee technology for communication among the physical components and hence the effectiveness of the system is improved. This life saving system reduces the mortality rate of heart patients and it act as an effective heart care service to patients.},

  abstract={The perception and awareness of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear ("CBRN") emergencies is rising. These hazards are not directly detectable by human senses and thus no inborn reactions exist. As a consequence, special tools to detect these dangers have to be utilized. Since these dangers tend to affect large areas, it is necessary to establish standardized, coherent ¿Best Practices¿, which have to be specifically trained under realistic but safe conditions. Modern technology allows simulating complex scenarios. The goal of the SimRad project is the user centered development and utilization of training and communication tools for all aspects of effective management of emergency situations, including team coordination. Regarding the process flow of First Responders intervention, emergency activities can be dissected into individual sub processes. This provides the basis for a purposeful optimization of individual activities through simulations, ranging from rough approximations to realistic simulations using Mixed Reality technology.},

  abstract={Recreation of 3D crime scenes is critical for law enforcement in the investigation of serious crimes for criminal justice responses. This work presents a premier systematic literature review (SLR) that offers a structured, methodical, and rigorous approach to understanding the trend of research in 3D crime scene reconstruction as well as tools, technologies, methods, and techniques employed thereof in the last 17 years. Major credible scholarly database sources, Scopus, and Google Scholar, which index journals and conferences that are promoted by entities such as IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, and SpringerLink were explored as data sources. Of the initial 17, 912 papers that resulted from the first search string, 258 were found to be relevant to our research questions after implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To summarize the existing efforts, we compared and analysed various classical 3D reconstruction approaches. This study presents the first comprehensive review of key milestones in the development of methods for 3D crime scene reconstruction, gaps for improvement and where immersive technology has been used to enhance crime scene findings. This study found that the implementation of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanners and immersive technologies, alongside traditional methods, has been beneficial in the recreation of crime scenes. The SLR is limited to existing applications with peer-reviewed papers published between 2005 and 2021. Results based on the analysed published data indicated that 20.2% of the articles implemented immersive technologies in crime scene reconstruction, of which Augmented Reality (AR) accounted for 15.3%, Virtual Reality (VR) accounted for 75%, Mixed reality (MR) accounted for 5.9% and VR and AR mixture accounted for 3.8%. Finally, we summarize the development trend of design and key technology prospects of crime scene recreation using immersive technology and provide insights into potential future research. To the best of the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first survey that accomplishes such goals.},

  abstract={In recent times, the emergence of the Metaverse has garnered worldwide attention as an innovative digital space that holds immense potential to provide a wide range of health services to medical professionals and patients. With increasing stress on healthcare systems, it has become crucial to explore the latest and cost-effective solutions that can provide fast and reliable medical services. The focus of this study, therefore, is to explore applications of metaverse in various health care systems and elaborate on how it can efficiently improve the clinical management of patients. Consequently, an in-depth assessment of the metaverse has been carried out, while covering its core fundamentals, key technologies, and diverse applications in healthcare and medicine, including but not limited to, emergency response learning, hands-on experience in anatomy learning, orthopaedics, paediatrics and so on. To carry out the study, we have used an exploratory approach to analyze qualitative data on healthcare metaverse services in our systematic review. Relevant articles from scientific databases such as Web of Science, Springer, Scopus, and IEEE have been identified, and the analysis has been conducted using the PRISMA reporting guideline to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting. The results of the study suggest that the metaverse has the potential to transform healthcare systems by introducing novel methods for delivering healthcare services. Metaverse’s AR/VR technologies can enable remote medical consultations and training, benefiting patients and healthcare professionals. Additionally, patients can access health-related information and resources, empowering them to manage their health better and make more informed decisions.},

  abstract={500 kV Extra High Voltage Transmission Lines, which have higher insulation level than other transmission lines with lower voltage level, should have more strength against lightning strikes. But in reality several problems appear. Broken insulators due to lightning strikes are often found in 500 kV EHV lines. Research on these problems was carried out at Paiton-Kediri lines. It took place especially in the areas that have higher lightning density. Broken insulator can cause lack of insulation strength and potentially reduce lines performance due to outages on the lines. In order to improve transmission lines lightning performance, a new innovation had been done by using Extended Mast Terminal (EMT) attached to transmission tower. EMT is a pylon that was installed at the top of transmission tower consists of Early Streamer Emission air terminal, double shielded down conductor, lightning event counter, and peak lightning current measurement system using commercial magnetic tape. The purpose of this research is to install and observe the use of EMT in Transmission Lines lightning performance by reducing the number of broken insulators. Installation of EMT in EHV lines Paiton Kediri had been done at the end of 2006. Significant result has been obtained in the lightning performance by installing the EMT on the EHV lines Paiton-Kediri.},

  abstract={Augmented reality (AR) applications that overlay the perception of the real world with digitally generated information are on the cusp of commercial viability. AR has appeared in several commercial platforms like Microsoft HoloLens and smartphones. They extend the user experience beyond two dimensions and supplement the normal 3D world of a user. A typical location-based multi-player AR application works through a three-step process, wherein the system collects sensory data from the real world, identifies objects based on their context, and finally, renders information on top of senses of a user. However, because these AR applications frequently exchange data with users, they have exposed new individual and public safety issues. In this paper, we develop ARSpy, a user location tracking system solely based on network traffic information of the user, and we test it on location-based multi-player AR applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme via real-world experiments on 12 volunteers and show that we could obtain the geolocation of any target with high accuracy. We also propose three mitigation methods to mitigate these side channel attacks. Our results reveal a potential security threat in current location-based multi-player AR applications and serve as a critical security reminder to a vast number of AR users.},

In this paper we present a PNS based on a wearable wireless device attached to the instep of the pedestrian. The implemented real time algorithm, is able to identify pedestrian's strides, estimating theirs length and direction by using information provided from an embedded Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The proposed device is also equipped with MicroSD slot and Bluetooth module for data storage and for sending information in real time. The proposed system has been tested through an objective experimental method in which ten volunteers were walking along three different tracks, five times each, keeping the IMU attached to the instep. In the first trial subjects walked along a straight path that is 90m long, in the second they walked twice along a rectangular path with long side equal to 15m and short side equal to 7.5m and in the last they walked 400m along a standard athletics track. For each test we computed absolute and average error. The results show that the average error is 3.52% for the straight track, 1.09% for the rectangular track and 3.71% for the elliptic track.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a human behavior recognition system based on a chest wearable device, which is used for the medical care of the elderly. In today’s aging society, it is very important for the quality of life and care of the elderly. Many nursing institutions seek technical support and respond to nurses. Due to insufficient manpower to control the behavior and health status of the elderly, the demand for an indoor positioning system (IPS) cannot be ignored. Using low-power Bluetooth to construct a location-based service (LBS) on a wearable device equipped with a nine-axis inertial sensor IMU and barometer can judge the posture of the wearer, including standing, walking, sitting, lying, and falling. The resultant force value is calculated by the three-axis acceleration, and the three-axis acceleration and the three-axis gyroscope are obtained through the gradient descent algorithm. The Euler angle and the altitude converted by the barometer can judge the behavior of sitting and standing up and the event of a fall. There is also an emergency button on the device, which allows the wearer to send a distress message, and monitor the wearer’s current behavior in real-time through the mobile APP and cloud, recording the wearer’s behavior and the physiological data of the bracelet and providing it for medical analysis.},

  abstract={Traditionally, firefighters used to use lifelines (example, ropes) when moving through places on fire under impaired visibility. However, these lifelines have their inherent drawbacks like they sometimes get stuck and limit the operational range. A recent research proposed that firefighters automatically deploy sensor nodes along their paths to establish an ad hoc network that promotes the required level of navigation and communication between firefighters who interact to the system using wearable computing devices. An alternative way to implement such system, is to deploy sensors during building construction or later to build a mission critical network that can be used for emergency purposes. Durability with respect to energy available is one of the primary challenges to the success of such networks. Workforce selection strategies which unevenly consume sensor energy can reduce the lifetime of the network significantly. This work proposes and evaluates a new class of strategies that provides an energy efficient workforce management for mission-critical WSNs (e.g. on-site indoor-navigation support system for slow moving firefighters under impaired visibility). Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases network lifetime by evenly consuming sensors energy.},

Here, separation of first responders in an unknown and dangerous environment could yield a fatal outcome. The goal of this work is to introduce technology that assists firefighters in situations with no visibility to locate team members. Due to the lack of pre-installed infrastructure, a relative ad-hoc localization scheme without the need for in place infrastructure is required. We propose a three-dimensional ultra-wideband based scheme and show a functional prototype with integrated transceivers combining both, two-way ranging range finding and phase-difference of arrival direction finding. Further, we show a potential architecture for integration in firefighter equipment such as helmet and mask utilizing augmented reality technology. Through multiple experiments we could show, that in the given laboratory setup direction estimation with an accuracy of 20o and position finding with an accuracy of 30cm is possible with the proposed approach.},

  abstract={In this paper, current applications of wearable computers are reviewed and categorized according to dimensions of “time” and “reference.” The time dimension is based on whether the system uses information that is stored, information that is current, or information that can help in predicting future events. The reference dimension is concerned with the type of application, event, task, environment, person, or artifact. Each of these categories can be described in terms of its temporal features (stored, current, or predicted). It is proposed that these dimensions distinguish wearable computers from their desk-bound counterparts, and this raises the question of appropriate paradigms for wearable computers.

SCINTILLA offers the capacity to finding a reliable alternative to Helium-3 based detection systems since the gas which is predominantly used in nuclear safeguards and security applications has now become very expensive, rare and nearly unavailable. SCINTILLA benchmarks results are based on international standards. Radiation Portal tests were carried out at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra (Italy). The scintilla project addresses few mains issues. The first is to develop neutron detectors for Radiation Portal Monitor (RPM) and the second is the need of new wearable integrated solutions for Spectrometric Personal Radiation Monitor (SPRM). The partners which provide technical systems of the scintilla project are INFN-ANSALDO, CEA, SYMETRICA and SAPHYMO. For RPM, the objective is to find reliable alternatives to Helium-3 historical neutron detector and provide technical solutions which cope with tests for reliable mobile and cost effective. For Spectrometric Personal Radiation Monitor (SPRM), SCINTILLA is innovating in technology areas that offer complementary capabilities for detecting and identifying gamma Two CZT (Cadmium Zinc Telluride) addressing contexts of used by first responder technologies, one is a wearable detector and the second is a gamma camera complemented by advanced image processing technologies.},

  abstract={Wearable haptic technologies have garnered recent widespread attention due to increased accessibility, functionality, and affordability. These systems typically provide haptic feedback to augment the human ability to interact with their environment. This study compares two haptic feedback modalities, vibrotactile and EMS, against visual feedback to elicit a motor response during active hand movement. Forty-five participants, divided into three groups, performed a task to touch their face and received one of three possible sensory feedback cues, namely visual, vibrotactile, and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), to interrupt their movement and avoid touching their face. Two quantitative performance measures are used in the comparison, the response time (time elapsed from stimulation to motor response) and the error rate (percentage that the user fails to avoid touching their face). Results showed that vibrotactile and EMS feedback yielded significantly faster response time than visual feedback, while no significant differences between vibrotactile and EMS were observed. Furthermore, the error rate was significantly lower for EMS compared to visual feedback, whereas no significant differences were observed between vibrotactile and visual feedback. In conclusion, it seems that EMS feedback is preferable for applications where errors are not tolerable (critical medical applications), whereas vibrotactile is superior for non-critical applications due to its low cost and higher usability (more pleasant compared to EMS).},

  abstract={Rwanda has made a lot of change in health care systems due to the emergency of pandemics that put a lot of number of people at risks of being infected. Due to the huge number of people looking for health services and a shortage of health infrastructure including a few numbers of trained medicine doctors in developing countries, there are unexpected deaths of people due to the shortage of infrastructures to accommodate a big number of incoming patients [1]. The government of Rwanda confirmed the policy of keeping some of the patients at their home place during their sicknesses (Home based care). However, due to the lack of the real time information about the patients or the individuals at their home place, this can put the many people at the risk of being dead.This paper serves to analyze the performance of the existing wearable devices worldwide and to develop a wearable hardware product that would be used to monitor the patient at their home place without a need of physical interaction between the doctor and patient. This wearable device should help the patients' health conditions to be monitored continuously through the wireless communication environment. The proposed system employs physiological sensors such as temperature and heart rate sensors for helping in remote monitoring the physical conditions of the patients reside at their home place and GPS sensor for tracking the location of the patient. The results show that the implemented product could trigger the notification to the remote doctor through the SMS and personal Email if an emergence case or an abnormal condition is detected in human body.},

  abstract={Natural disasters such as earthquakes, avalanches or events such as explosions and fire accidents frequently occur. Drone technology is a promising solution for disaster management where the mainstream communication infrastructure is unavailable or damaged. A swarm of drones serve as an Adhoc network to support rescue management activities. This project aims to design and develop an IoT-enabled Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) to monitor the health status of Search and Rescue (SAR) teams in real-time in the event of floods and wildfires. The proposed WBAN architecture consists of the SAR team equipped with wearable body sensors, which collect health and environmental data for location determination and vital signs transmission. The Body Data Coordinator relays this data to the nearest gateway, equipped with an open-source, industry-grade middleware platform to allow data processing at the Edge and transmission to the Ground Control Station and further to the Cloud endpoint for further processing. There is a risk to personal health due to the arduous duties of first responders, which can cause high blood pressure among the SAR personnel and lead to acute cardiovascular events. There is a need to predict the risk of hypertension in first responders. This paper also discusses a time series-based forecasting algorithm to predict the BP Trends of the first resnonders involved in SAR activities.},

  abstract={Sudden and unexpected death due to heart failure is a major cause of mortality among middle aged and elderly people. An efficient heart monitoring system can find out the malformation of heart conditions and that can also be helpful in diagnose at critical ambience. Sometimes the distance between patients and doctors is the main barrier that people do not have access to quality health services and thus having trouble for their regular health examine. IoT-based healthcare monitoring system is one of the manifested application areas in medical science. As a significant access in diagnose heart disease ECG observing system is widely used. In this paper, a progressive method for ECG monitoring system based on Internet of Things (IoT) has been proposed. In this study, a system is designed to frequently monitor the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal collected from patient's body using wearable sensors and the data is stored into the database which can be accessed by authorized personnel only. When any malformation is found an automatic email is sent to the users and doctors for analyzing about the critical conditions of the patients and provides emergency health assistances. In order to verify the authenticity of this system tests have been implemented on several patients and the report shows that, this system is dependable and efficient for collecting real time ECG data which can be very helpful in diagnose heart diseases. This IoT-based low cost device can be reliably used to reduce the risk of disability and mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) employs smart devices as its building blocks for developing a ubiquitous communication framework. It thus supports a wide variety of application domains, including public safety, healthcare, education, and public transportation. While offering a novel communication paradigm, IoT finds its requirements closely connected to the security issues. The role of security following the fact that a new type of devices known as wearables constitute an emerging area. This paper delivers an applicability study of the state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives for wearable IoT devices, including the pairing-based cryptography. Pairing-based schemes are well-recognized as fundamental enablers for many advanced cryptographic applications, such as privacy protection and identity-based encryption. To deliver a comprehensive view on the computational power of modern wearable devices (smart phones, watches, and embedded devices), we perform an evaluation of a variety of them utilizing bilinear pairing for real-time communication. In order to deliver a complete picture, the obtained bilinear pairing results are complemented with performance figures for classical cryptography (such as block ciphers, digital signatures, and hash functions). Our findings show that wearable devices of today have the needed potential to efficiently operate with cryptographic primitives in real time. Therefore, we believe that the data provided during this research would shed light on what devices are more suitable for certain cryptographic operations.},

  abstract={Stress detection has a huge potential for disease prevention and management, and to improve the quality of life of people. Also, work safety can be improved if stress is timely and reliably detected. The availability of low-cost consumer wearable devices that monitor vital-signs, gives access to stress detection schemes. Heart rate variability (HRV), a stress-related vital-sign, was derived from wearable device data to reliably determine stress-levels. In order to build and train a deployable stress-detector, we collected labeled HRV data in controlled environments, where subjects were exposed to physical, psychological and combined stress. We then applied machine learning to separate and identify the different stress types and understand the relationship with HRV data. The resulting C5 decision tree model is capable of identifying the stress type with 88% accuracy, in a 1-minute time window. For the first time physical and psychological stress can be distinguished with a 1-minute time resolution from smoke-divers, firefighters, who enter high-risk environments to rescue people, and experience intense physical and psychological stress. To improve our model, we created an integrated system to acquire expert labels in real-time from firefighters during their training in a Rescue Maze. A next goal is to transfer the algorithms into generic systems for monitoring and coaching high-risk professionals to improve their stress resilience during training and reduce their risk in the field.},

  abstract={The extreme conditions of combat and multi-casualty rescue often make field triage difficult and put the medic or first responder at risk. In an effort to improve field triage, we have developed an automated remote triage system called ARTEMIS (automated remote triage and emergency management information system) for use in the battlefield or disaster zone. Common to field injuries is a sudden change in arterial pressure resulting from massive blood loss or shock. In effort to stabilize the arterial pressure, the sympathetic system is strongly activated and sympathetic tone is increased. This preliminary research seeks to empirically demonstrate that a forehead reflectance pulse oximeter is a viable sensor for detecting sudden changes in sympathetic tone. We performed the classic supine-standing experiment and collected the raw waveform, the photoplethysmogram (PPG), continuously using a forehead reflectance pulse oximeter. The resulting waveform was processed in Matlab using various spectral analysis techniques (FFT and AR). Our preliminary results show that a relative ratio analysis (low frequency power/high frequency power) for both the raw PPG signal and its derived pulse statistics (height, beat-to-beat interval) is a useful technique for detecting change in sympathetic tone resulting from positional change.},

  abstract={In this work, a novel computational approach for the dynamic adaptation of User Interfaces (UIs) is proposed, which aims at enhancing the Situational Awareness (SA) of users by leveraging the current context and providing the most useful information, in an optimal and efficient manner. By combining Ontology modeling and reasoning with Combinatorial Optimization, the system decides what information to present, when to present it, where to visualize it in the display - and how, taking into consideration contextual factors as well as placement constraints. The main objective of the proposed approach is to optimize the SA associated with the displayed UI at run-time, while avoiding information overload and induced stress. In the context of this work, we have deployed our computational approach to the use case of an Augmented Reality (AR) system for Law Enforcement Agents (LEAs). To explore the benefits and limitations of the developed system, two evaluations have been conducted. The first one was an expert-based evaluation with LEAs and User Experience (UX) experts, assessing the appropriateness of the system’s decisions. The second one was a user-based evaluation involving LEAs from different agencies, estimating the SA, the mental workload and the overall UX associated with the system, through an AR simulation. The results indicate that the system enhances SA, and while not imposing workload, it provides an overall positive UX.},

  abstract={Mental workload assessment is of great importance for safety critical applications, especially in situations that involve physical demands, such as with first responders (e.g., paramedics, firefighters, or police officers). Advancements in physiological signal monitoring with wearable sensors have made way for real-time mental workload assessment using physiological signals. However, these models have typically been conducted in controlled laboratory settings and rely on a single physiological modality. As a result, such models often experience a drop in performance due to movement artifacts introduced in real-life conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that a multi-modal mental workload model not only improves measurement accuracy, but can also increase robustness against physical activity artifacts. To this end, an experiment was conducted where mental workload and physical activity levels were modulated simultaneously while physiological data was collected from 48 participants using off-the-shelf wearable devices. Results show improved mental workload assessment with multi-modal fusion under varying physical activity conditions.},

  abstract={With the advances of wireless communication and mobile computing, there is a growing interest among researchers about augmented reality and streaming 3D graphics on mobile devices for training first responders to be better prepared in a case of disaster scenarios. However, several challenges need to be resolved before this technology become a commodity. One of the major difficulties in 3D streaming over thin mobile devices is related to the supplying partner strategy as it is not easy to discover the peer that has the correct information and that posses enough bandwidth to send the required data quickly and efficiently to the peers in need. In this paper, we propose a new supplying partner strategy for mobile networks-based 3D streaming. The primary goal of the work presented in this paper is first to address the thin mobile devices low storage capabilities; and second to avoid the flooding problem that most wireless mobile networks suffer from. Our proposed protocol is based on the quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by optimizing the time required by peers to acquire data, avoiding unnecessary messages propagation and network congestion, and decreasing the latency and the network bandwidth over utilization.},

This approach is based on the automatic remote monitoring and assessment of the physical, the respiration and the circulation condition of the patient. It consists basically on a wrist wearable device with wireless communication functions. Together with practitioners from the red cross we defined a new algorithm to evaluate the physiological condition of the patient, where the goal is the automated distinction between minor and major affected victims. This information is continuously reported to the rescue manager to support the tactical planning of the operation.

  abstract={Governments around the world are interested in public safety services for protecting the public from violent crimes. For the public safety services, a technology for detecting violent activities attracts attentions. This paper proposes an analysis method for analyzing punches by using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and long short-term memory (LSTM) of accelerometer and gyroscope data of wearable devices. The proposed method analyzed characteristics of accelerometer data in frequency domain by using FFT. The proposed method achieves 97.27% accuracy and 97.27% F1-score for classifying types of punches (e.g., left hook, left jab, right cross, and right hook) by using LSTM. The proposed method will contribute to detect violent activities and thus will help fast response to the violent crimes.},

  abstract={Metamaterials are artificially engineered novel substances (or matter) that exhibit properties not found in nature. One of the earliest examples of a metamaterial structure is the split-ring resonator. This article is a current review of metamaterials, what it is, its classification, and its applications towards the field of antennas and radio frequency identification (RFID) devices. There are two major types of metamaterial antennas: leaky-wave antennas, and resonant antennas. Antennas can be made from composite right-left handed metamaterials, or antennas can be loaded with a metamaterial screen such as a shelled electrically small antenna (ESA) fed by coax. Metamaterial resonators can aid in reducing the antenna size, help improve the gain, improve the directivity, improve the return loss, and control the radiation pattern (by loading the antenna with a tunable unit). Recent advances in printing and fabricating technologies have allowed for use of metamaterial antennas in wearable gadgets and textiles; and can be used in conjunction with RFID devices and tags to advance and aid (emergency) equipment used by first responders.},

  pages={3417-3427},
  abstract={In multichannel EEG, several electrodes are attached to the head that may be annoying for patients and troublesome for operators. Moreover, the number of electrodes is the main reason of the infeasibility of developing EEG based wearable and point of care devices. To address this problem, recently, the concept of single-channel EEG (SCEEG) is presented. The spatial resolution of SCEEG is lower than the multichannel one, but it is easy to use, cost-effective, ubiquitous, and wearable. In this paper, for the first time, we have developed the concept of SCEEG for the classification of responders and nonresponders to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD). We also compared the performance of SCEEG and multichannel EEG with the different number of channels in the prediction of responding to rTMS treatment. 19-electrode EEG is recorded from 46 MDD patients before rTMS treatment. Among participants, 23 individuals responded to treatment. The dataset is partitioned into the training (36 subjects) and testing (10 subjects) datasets. Linear and nonlinear features were extracted from every channel of EEG. In training, to select informative features, the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) algorithm was applied. The selected features were classified by k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier, which is evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Then the obtained classifier is applied to the testing dataset. The results demonstrated that the F8 channel classifies responders and nonresponders with an accuracy of 80%. Moreover, our results revealed that SCEEG could perform as multichannel EEG in the prediction of rTMS treatment outcome in MDD patients. The obtained accuracy indicates that our proposed method based on SCEEG has a high potential for predicting rTMS treatment outcome in MDD patients.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. We have observed regenerative photoinduced pulsations of optical and radio-frequency signals, generated by CW laser irradiation from Ar-ion laser in LiNbO/sub 3/:Fe. Pulsating optical scattering from the crystal has a distinct spatial structure in the form of expanding circular rings or bright crosses. Simultaneously, strong electromagnetic signals (EMS) are emitted from the crystal with bandwidth of about 1 GHz at 10% signal level. EMS was detected by an antenna-type electrode and analyzed by oscilloscope. We also have observed temporal modulation of the polarization state of cross-propagated signal beams at /spl lambda/ = 514 and 647 nm, synchronized with the EMS pulsations. Our explanation of the observed pulsations is based on self-organization of the photoinduced scattering into an array of reflection-type holographic gratings. Backscattering light waves combine with the forward pump wave, resulting in recording of the set of reflection electric-field gratings. The photogalvanic effect contributes to grating recording and creates a strong electric field along the optical axis about 50 kV/cm, which changes Bragg conditions for the holographic light scattering. This strong field also causes modulation of the probe signal laser beam due to modulation of birefringence by the electro-optic effect. As a result, strong space-charge waves are generated in the crystal, leading to the observed EMS picked-up by the antenna electrode.},

  abstract={This paper presents an indoor navigation system based on sensor data from first responder wearable modules. The proposed system integrates data from an inertial sensor, a digital camera and a radio frequency identification device using a sophisticated fuzzy algorithm. To improve the navigation accuracy, different types of first responder activities and operational conditions were examined and classified according to extracted qualitative attributes. The vertical acceleration data, which indicates the periodic vibration during gait cycle, is used to evaluate the accuracy of the inertial based navigation subsystem. The amount of strong feature correspondences assess the quality of the three-dimensional scene knowledge from digital camera feedback. Finally, the qualitative attribute, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the radio frequency identification subsystem, is the degree of probability of each location estimate. Fuzzy if-then rules are then applied to these three attributes in order to carry out the fusion task. Simulation results based on the proposed architecture have shown better navigation effectiveness and lower positioning error compared with the used stand alone navigation systems.},

  abstract={Ensuring women’s safety in smart cities is a need of the hour. Even though several legal and technological steps are adopted worldwide, women’s safety continues to be an international concern. Criminal records are maintained by law enforcement agencies and are most often not available to the public in an easily comprehensible form. While some wearable devices and mobile applications are available which are touted to aid in ensuring women’s safety, they utilize limited societal intervention and are not very efficient in ensuring the safety of the women as and when required. Most often the crime response, crime analysis, and crime prevention schemes are not integrated, leading to gaps in ensuring women’s safety. Our major contribution is in developing a holistic system encompassing the three crucial aspects, i.e crime analysis and mapping, crime prevention, and emergency response by leveraging societal participation for women safety management. This work applies the Geographic Information System (GIS) for the identification of hotspots and patterns of crime. The proposed system uses data generated from the mobile application and/or wearable gadget prototyped as a part of this work along with the criminal history records for crime response, analysis, and prevention. The system for the hotspot identification is demonstrated for the Pilani town in the Jhunjhunu district in the state of Rajasthan, India, and can be easily scaled up geographically and utilized as a safety strategy for smart cities. While the common man is provided a cost-effective solution via the developed mobile application or wearable gadget, the various components are integrated into a website for supervisory management and can be utilized by law enforcement agencies.},

  abstract={The use of wearable devices, such as smartwatches, glasses, clothes, and fitness bracelets is increasing at an ever-growing pace. Major corporations and insurance companies have started mandating their use for their employees and clients. Data from such devices have begun to feature in settlement claims and as evidence in courts as well, requiring it to be irrefutable and tamper-proof. Lack of protection for personal data as well as the contextual information such as location tracking and its use by law enforcement agencies is raising serious privacy concerns among the general public and civil liberty advocates. In this article, we propose a novel scheme to secure the wearable sensor's communication through its crowdsourced logging by neighboring wearable and smart devices called witnesses preserving the contextual information (such as time and location) as well. To ensure witness privacy, gateway and witness devices use the reciprocity property of wireless medium between them to generate pairs of closely matching link signatures, which not only provide the proof of presence for the witnesses in the vicinity but also act as their time-varying pseudonyms. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of our scheme through the prototype implementation using real wireless devices, and via simulation and experimental results.},

The main objective is to maximize system availability and reliability in cases of disaster or large-scale unplanned events.

The solution focuses on the different user roles and work processes of a public safety network operator. Supported by intelligent fault handling, evolving correlation rules, enhanced help system, end-to-end work process integration, extended test functionalities, real time status and performance views, and other key functionalities, the solution increases usability and applicability for operations organizations. Open interfaces allow future extensions. The basic principles for the technical implementation are the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software applications in combination with reference to frameworks such as the enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) and Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). Successful reference projects have shown that operations organizations can increase their effectiveness by increasing the amount of information they have available.

  abstract={To accurately capture the dynamics of a large-scale ac/dc system as a whole and the interactions between its individual components, a simulation method with high precision and efficiency is in great demand. For this purpose, we develop a multi-domain co-simulation method, in which the target system is partitioned into multiple dc and ac subsystems, represented by our proposed shifted-frequency phasor (SFP) models and the traditional EMT models, respectively. SFP models can be simulated with a much larger time step, leading to a significant improvement in simulation efficiency under a given requirement of precision. Further, a new interface model, namely, hybrid multi-domain transmission-line model (HMD-TLM), is developed to reflect the interactions between SFP models and EMT models, with the additional benefit of producing instantaneous and phasor waveforms simultaneously. Thus, the multi-domain co-simulation is implemented based on the efficient SFP models, the HMD-TLM, and a designed time sequences of simulation. The performance (efficiency and accuracy) of the proposed method has been validated on the well-known CIGRE ac/dc system as well as a practical system integrating large ac grids and modular-multilevel-converter-based multi-terminal dc grids.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Low-power wearable technologies offer a promising solution to pervasive epilepsy monitoring by removing the constraints concerning time and location, on one hand, and fulfilling long-term tracking, on the other hand. In the case of epileptic seizures, as the attacks infrequently occur, using an anomaly detection approach reduces the need to record long hours of data for each patient before detecting the successive coming seizures. In this work, by combining the concepts of self-aware system and anomaly detection, we propose an energy-efficient system to detect epileptic seizures on single-lead electrocardiographic signals, which is personalized after analyzing the first seizure of the patient. This system, then, uses a simple anomaly-detection model, whenever the model is deemed reliable, and uses a more complex model otherwise. We show that after the personalization, the number of patients, for which the method provides high sensitivity, can reach 26 out of 43 patients with the false alarm rate (FAR) of 4 alarms/day. Thus, the number of responders to the system is increased by 24%, while the FAR is only increased by one alarm/day, compared to the system that just uses the simple model. This benefit occurs while the system complexity decreases by 27.7% compared to the complex model. After adding the two-level (simple and complex) anomaly-detection, the complexity is tuned between 72.3% and 37.6% of the complex model. Similarly, the sensitivity is tuned between 66.5% and 60.3%.},

  abstract={Rescue workers, such as fire fighters often face conditions that impose a combination of threats on them: severe physical and mental stress, limited or no visibility, unknown layout of buildings may induce disorientation. Systems capable of continuously locating all members of a rescue team could help to maintain orientation, and in cases of accident, help other team members or team leaders to localize colleagues in danger. The paper points out the discrepancy between state of the art in research projects, primarily in the fields of wearable computing and indoor navigation, and the lack of operational systems that have been fielded or have undergone sustained usage. The paper shows, that a successful operational system for continuous navigation of rescue teams requires a combination of several sensors, motion models, computing, communication means, and human machine interfaces. Based on an analysis of rescue operations and interviews with rescue workers, relevant issues and requirements are derived. A reference architecture for an operational system for continuous navigation of rescue teams is outlined. Its implementation and feasibility aspects are discussed.

ALIKE is a cloud-based system that integrates 3D scans, AI, image recognition, and augmented reality to help homeowners improve the safety of their homes and conduct pre-incident planning with the local fire department. The ALIKE system provides for two modal approaches: the homeowner system approach and the firefighter system approach. Watson AI functionality within ALIKE system can identify potential fire safety issue in the home, examine the issue and recommend fire safe products to mitigate the potential hazard. Thus, the cause of residential fires would be reduced to a great extent, providing safer homes for residents.},

  abstract={Nowadays there is a huge number of innovative wireless services demanded by the users and all of them require antennas with new features. One of these new characteristics which is very convenient for the comfortability of the users is the integration of some of these services in the garments in other words to design wearable terminals. On the other hand, for monitoring or detection applications, such as firefighters, the integration of the antennas in these garments is not only a question of convenience, it is a security necessity. However, most of the actual devices loose part of the radiated energy in radiation to the body of the wearers. In this communication, we propose the combination of soft surfaces with traditional microstrip patch antennas for reducing the level of back radiation in wearable applications. The studied has been extended to the case of cylindrical modification of the antenna's shape to take into account the conform-ability that will be required to the textile antenna.},

  abstract={Development of a robust and scalable multicamera surveillance system is the need of the hour to ensure public safety and security. Being able to reidentify and track one or more targets over multiple nonoverlapping camera field of views in a crowded environment remains an important and challenging problem because of occlusions, large change in the viewpoints, and illumination across cameras. However, the rise of wearable imaging devices has led to new avenues in solving the reidentification (re-id) problem. Unlike static cameras, where the views are often restricted or low resolution and occlusions are common scenarios, egocentric/first person views (FPVs) mostly get zoomed in, unoccluded face images. In this paper, we present a person re-id framework designed for a network of multiple wearable devices. The proposed framework builds on commonly used facial feature extraction and similarity computation methods between camera pairs and utilizes a data association method to yield globally optimal and consistent re-id results with much improved accuracy. Moreover, to ensure its utility in practical applications where a large amount of observations are available every instant, an online scheme is proposed as a direct extension of the batch method. This can dynamically associate new observations to already observed and labeled targets in an iterative fashion. We tested both the offline and online methods on realistic FPV video databases, collected using multiple wearable cameras in a complex office environment and observed large improvements in performance when compared with the state of the arts.},

  abstract={Mobile healthcare applications highly depend on healthcare data, which is collected from wearable or implantable sensors. However, sensor readings may be inaccurate due to resource-constrained devices, sensor misplacement, patient with smearing, and other environmental related causes. Analyzing healthcare data is of paramount importance to provide high quality-care services and reduce false medical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an online approach to detect inaccurate measurements and to raise alerts only when patients seem to be in emergency situations. The proposed approach is based on robust principal component analysis and adaptive threshold for multivariate anomaly detection, and on contribution plots for univariate anomaly diagnosis. We apply our proposed approach on real medical dataset. Our experimental results prove the effectiveness of our approach in detecting and diagnosing anomalous physiological measurements. The reduced time and space complexities of our approach make it useful and efficient for real time mobile health applications.},

  abstract={The integration of wearable and integrated sensing technologies with cloud computing has the potential to promote the development of large-scale monitoring applications and to provide public safety as a service to end-users. In this paper, we proposed a system that relies on the integration of heterogeneous sensor networks and cloud computing to build distributed public safety databases and to provide cooperative composite services provisioning in infrastructure-less areas. The contributions are three fold. The first contribution consists in designing a Sensor-Clouds based architecture that integrates different WSNs and cloud computing and aims to report on the evolution of a particular set of public safety threats. The second contribution focuses on describing a system model for composite Sensor-Cloud services provisioning that allows to identify and classify the sensor-cloud services that can be made available to end-users regardless of the geographical distribution of sensor networks. The third contribution describes a two-layer composite service delivery in order to efficiently cover several services requested by end-users. While, the first level defines a static composite service delivery the second level defines dynamic composite services that are delivered and versioned based on a set of heuristics to address users' requirements and expectation. The proposed approach is evaluated through a simulation.},

  pages={213574-213586},
  abstract={Electroencephalography (EEG) is immediate and sensitive to cortical impairment resulting from ischemic stroke and is considered as the potential predictive tool of stroke onset, and post-stroke clinical management. Brainwave monitoring outside the heavily equipped clinical environment demands a low-cost, portable, and wearable EEG system. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using an ambulatory EEG system to classify the stroke patient group with neurological changes due to ischemic stroke and the control healthy adult group. HealthSOS, a real-time health monitoring system for stroke prognostics, is proposed here, which consists of an eye-mask embedded portable EEG device, data analytics, and medical ontology based health advisor service. This system was investigated with 37 stroke patients (mean age 71.6 years, 61% male) admitted in the emergency unit of a hospital and 36 healthy elderly volunteers (mean age 76 years, 28% male). EEG was recorded in resting-state using the portable device with frontal cortical electrodes (Fp1, Fp2) embedded in an eye-mask within 120 h after the onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke (confirmed clinically). The EEG data acquisition of the left and right brain hemispheres was done for at least 15 minutes in the awake resting state while subjects laid down on the bed. The statistical result shows that the revised brain symmetry index (rsBSI), the delta-alpha ratio, and the delta-theta ratio of the stroke group differ significantly from those of the healthy control group. In the machine learning analysis, the support vector machine (SVM) model shows the highest accuracy (Overall accuracy: 92%) and the highest Gini coefficient (95%) in classification performance. This study will be useful for early stroke prognostics and the management of post-stroke treatment.},

  abstract={Recent advances in wearable cameras and storage devices allow us to record the holistic human experience for an extended period of time. Such a life-log system can capture audio-visual data anywhere and at any time. It has a wide range of applications from law enforcement, journalism, medicine to personal archival. On the other hand, there is a natural apprehension towards such an intrusive system as the audio-visual information of unsuspecting subjects captured in the life-log video may be misused. Thus, along with the technical challenges, the privacy and legal issues arising in such recordings must be carefully addressed. In this paper, we describe a wearable life-log system that combines real-time audio distortion and visual blocking to protect the privacy of the subjects captured in life-log video. For audio, our system automatically isolates the subject's speech and distorts it using a pitch-shifting algorithm to conceal the identity. For video, our system uses a real-time face detection, tracking and blocking algorithm to obfuscate the faces of the subjects. Extensive experiments have been conducted on interview videos to demonstrate the ability of our system in protecting the identity of the subject while maintaining the usability of the life-log video.},

  abstract={The last decade marked an exponential increase in photovoltaic (PV) systems installed on the rooftop of domestic residences within Europe. This situation was basically favored by generous financial schemes such as Feed-in-Tariff and the market of green certificates. However, such governmental incentives drastically reduced, or they were already replaced with net-metering schemes which favor different scenarios: increase of self-consumption and decrease of grid-back injections. This unstable regulatory environment puts both new and old owners of PV systems under a regulatory financial risk. Recently, a regulatory resilient architecture, called UniRCon, was proposed, to overcome both financial and technical regulation uncertainties, where local battery energy storage system plays a key role. Besides the architecture we propose a real-time energy management system (EMS) that could be used for the daily operation of such systems. The real-time EMS is needed to prove the feasibility of this solution in short and long run and it could be also used as the main subroutine in the financial risk analysis. The EMS is based on a mixed-integer linear programming energy management tool that considers possible arbitrage benefits due to price difference in the energy purchased from the grid, while explicitly considering the efficiency of the power electronic interfaces (converters) according to the operation point. We prove our approach using a lab-scale experimental setup of a DC residential microgrid. The results are analyzed under realistic operation scenarios derived from one-year load and PV power output measurements.},

  abstract={Wide area measurement system (WAMS) can measure power grid data synchronously in the time scale of millisecond, but the large amount of data it produced determines that it cannot take the place of SCADA presently. WAMS and SCADA should complement each other in practice, it is very necessary for WAMS to exchange data and information with energy management system (EMS) and correlative application systems. But now it is difficult for WAMS to share information with other applications effectively since the lack of a uniform information model. After deeply exploring the IEC 61970: Energy management system application program interface (EMS-API) part 303: CIM and its modeling principles, a CIM-based information model for WAMS is proposed according to the characteristics of WAMS and its applications in power system, while the extended CIM-based classes as well as its attributes are also elaborately defined.

  abstract={The Multiport Power Electronics Interface (MPEI) has the advantages of low cost, high efficiency, high power density, high reliability, and ease of management over conventional multiple-converter based distributed power systems. Therefore, it is considered as the best candidate for integrating hybrid energy sources, especially when renewable sources are locally available, to supply low-to medium-power range applications such as microgrids, rural areas, military camps and critical industrial zones. In this paper, a comprehensive energy management system (EMS) of MPEI for hybrid energy sources based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed. The proposed system consists of a grid-connected MPEI that integrates three types of energy sources - dispatchable, nondispatchable, and energy storage - to feed a local load. The objectives of the proposed EMS are to minimize the total daily operating cost of the system with the optimal use of the energy resources, minimize diesel fuel consumption, and minimize pollutant gas emissions while considering the physical and practical constraints of different energy sources. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear dynamic optimization framework that can be solved using the SCIP solver, which is non-commercial solver that solves these kinds of problems. The MATLAB® software program is utilized along with the YALMIP optimization tool in the implementation of the proposed EMS to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.},

  abstract={Elder neglect is one of the most prevalent yet underestimated types of elder abuse. It can be associated with adverse health outcomes for the elders. IoT -based elder care systems have been widely used in today's scenario; however, the existing systems require a manual operation by the elders, which is not practical during emergency situations. The presented work is an entirely autonomous alerting system which does not require manual operation by the elder. It has a wearable module consisting of sensors connected to an ESP32 and a home module consisting of an IoT Camera connected to a Raspberry-Pi. Body vitals collected through the sensors are processed using machine learning in the Amazon Web Services cloud. If an abnormality is detected, alerts are sent to the caregivers. Other key functionalities such as vital monitoring, fall detection, and location tracking are also implemented. Computer Vision has been employed to address everyday challenges such as irregular medicine intake.},

  abstract={It is anticipated that wearable wireless sensors in Body Area Network (BAN) will increase the functionality of lifestyle and health care devices to gradually match the needs of society by year 2010 and people will carry their personal Body Area Network. The applications in areas like lifestyle, assisted living, sports, entertainment functionalities, toxic levels in the lungs of a Fire- Fighter, radiation exposure in war zones etc are already being explored. Yet one very exciting, revolutionary and life saving application in the form of Real time stress monitoring of Fighter Pilots through wearable wireless sensors in BAN has not been thought of. The statistics reveal that 40% of total flying accidents in Indian Air Force (IAF) occur due to pilot error, however, so far no scientific study has been undertaken to ascertain whether certain non-action/delayed actions taken by pilots in such accidents were related to stress induced. The current paper proposes the entire workable concept which when implemented will be able to provide some valuable insights of human behavior under high 'g' conditions as well as save lives of pilots.},

  abstract={For years, emergency medical response communities have relied upon paper triage tags, clipboards of notes, and voice communications to share information during medical emergencies. This workflow, however, has proven labor intensive, time consuming, and prone to human error. In collaboration with three EMS groups in the Washington, DC Metropolitan area, we have developed a next generation triage system to improve the effectiveness of emergency response. This system includes: 1) electronic triage tags, 2) wearable vital sign sensors, 3) base stations laptops to monitor and manage patients, 4) pervasive tracking software to locate patients at all stages of the disaster response process, and 5) PDAs to support documentation and communication. Our system has evolved through three iterations of rapiddevelopment, field-studies, usability reviews, and focusgroup interview. This paper summarizes engineering considerations for technologies that must operate under constraints of medical emergencies. It is our hope that the lessons reported in this paper will help technologists in developing future emergency response systems.},

  abstract={This paper presents a synchronous kinesthetic interaction among people through haptic input/output based on biosignal measurement and stimulation. Users are able to bi-directionally transmit kinesthetic experiences such as rigidity of joints or exertion of muscles in addition to physical bodily motion. Such interaction would be very important in the fields of rehabilitation and sports training. In this study, we introduce a set of wearable devices that is capable of both electromyogram (EMG) measurement and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) simultaneously on the same muscle by using common electrodes. To achieve smooth kinesthetic bi-directional interaction, we propose a new method for discharging the residual potential of the stimulation in order to enable fastest simultaneous operation (40Hz). Through a performance evaluation, participants could recognize the teacher's exertion strength on a 5-point scale without visual information.},

  abstract={WAMS (Wide Area Measurement System) is a newly developed technology, which can provide a reliable guarantee to the simultaneous measurement of power system. But PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) can not be widely used in power grid now, so it is impossible that WAMS can replace SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system presently. Hence, how to incorporate WAMS measuring data into other systems including SCADA has become a hot research topic currently especially the data exchange between them. In order to solve this problem, a CIM (Common Information Model)-based information model for WAMS is proposed in this paper according both to IEC 61970: EMS-API (Energy Management System Application Program Interface) part 303 and the principle and the application of WAMS. This paper establishes a new package named WAMS in the framework of CIM and then some extended classes and their attributes along with their relationships are also defined. Finally this paper briefly describes the application of this CIM-based information model by presenting a flow diagram about information integration and utilization between WAMS and SCADA.},

  abstract={Understanding a patient's state is critical to providing optimal care. However, information loss occurs during patient hand-offs (e.g., emergency services (EMS) transferring patient care to a receiving hospital), which hinders care quality. Augmenting the information flow from an EMS vehicle to a receiving hospital may reduce information loss and improve patient outcomes. Such augmentation requires a noninvasive system that can automatically recognize clinical procedures being performed and send near real-time information to a receiving hospital. An automatic clinical procedure detection system that uses wearable sensors, video, and machine-learning to recognize clinical procedures within a controlled environment is presented. The system demonstrated how contextual information and a majority vote method can substantially improve procedure recognition accuracy.

  abstract={Since the late 1990s, social media has added more features and users. Due to the rise of social media, blogs and posts by common people are now a part of mainstream journalism. Twitter is a place where people can share their ideas about culture, society, the economy, and politics. India's large population and rising crime rate make it hard for law enforcement to find and stop illegal activities. This article shows the use of Twitter data to analyse, forecast, and visualise criminal activity using statistical and machine learning models and geospatial visualisation techniques. This helps law enforcement agencies make the best use of their limited resources and put them in the right places. The research aims to present a spatial and temporal picture of crime in India and is split into three parts: Classification, Visualisation, and Forecasting. Crime tweets are identified using a hashtag query argument in the tweepy python package's search_tweets function, followed by substring-keyword classification. The visualisation uses gmaps and bokeh python packages for geospatial and matplotlib for analytical applications. The forecasting portion compares AR, ARIMA, and LSTM to determine the best model for time series forecasting of crime tweet count.},

We have introduced our concept of state variable integration that realizes loose-coupling and proper-granularity in Web services of an SOA-EMS. We have confirmed the effectiveness of our state variable integration in a field test with an office building. In this case, our integration services provide 4 integrated state variables from 172800 raw data for a day.

  abstract={There are immediate needs for audio/visual surveillance systems in a large number of areas including law enforcement, military, commercial, and personal security. A series of cameras connected to a local ldquomonitoring centerrdquo via a wireless mesh network can provide instantaneous ad-hoc monitoring of several environments. However, there are several issues that must be resolved particularly when considering a large number of cameras monitoring a large area. In particular, it is difficult to monitor and control such a large number of cameras and as a result, important events may be missed altogether. In addition, some of these surveillance systems are set up in an instant ad-hoc manner, which means that any operator monitoring the system can easily lose the sense of direction when switching between different camera views. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we describe an ongoing project that seeks the development of an instantaneous ad-hoc audio/visual-based mesh network surveillance system which incorporates an augmented-reality-based three-dimensional graphical user interface to efficiently control and monitor a large number of video surveillance cameras. The system also employs ldquointelligent visionrdquo and ldquointelligent audiordquo techniques to automatically detect and monitor particular events (e.g., intruders entering the scene being monitored) in both the audio and video domain.},

  abstract={Comprehensive multimodal psychophysiological measurements and smart data analysis based on wearable and low-cost technologies could enhance traditional air traffic controller (ATC) selection process. Many recent studies in neuro-cognitive science and stress resilience illustrated effectiveness of these multimodal measurements and appropriate metrics in comprehensive assessment of ATCs' mental states, such as cognitive workload, cognitive decline, attention deficit, fatigue, emotional and behavioural problems, etc. Accordingly, this article is focused on innovation efforts in ATC selection protocols based on a set of comprehensive stimuli and corresponding multimodal psychophysiological measurements. The concept of enhancement of ATC selection process presented in this article includes complex physiological, oculometric and speech measurements and appropriate metrics. From these multimodal measurements during specific stimulation tasks, which include different versions of acoustic startle stimuli, airblasts, semantically relevant aversive images and sounds, different versions of Stroop tests, visual tracking test, a complex set of multimodal-multidimensional features is computed as predictors of ATC candidates' future performance, like: stress resilience, workload capacity, attention, visual performance, working memory etc. Such cost-effective, more objective, non-invasive preliminary measurements, lasting no longer than 45 minutes may have good discriminative power and might be used in ATC selection processes as enhancement of current selection procedures. Comprehensive analysis of presented multimodal features during different experimental conditions might also be very useful in selection processes of other stressful professional jobs, like first responders, pilots, astronauts etc.},

To this aim, we have developed an algorithm that combines both features extracted from the signal of a triaxial accelerometer and one ECG lead. Microprocessors integrated in the garments detect the signal magnitude area of inertial acceleration, step frequency, trunk inclination, heart rate (HR), and HR trend in real time. Given these inputs, a classifier assigns these signals to nine classes differentiating between certain physical activities (walking, running, moving on site), intensities (intense, mild, or at rest) and postures (lying down, standing up). Specific classes will be identified as dangerous to the rescuer during operation, such as, ¿subject motionless lying down¿ or ¿subject resting with abnormal HR.¿ Laboratory tests were carried out on seven healthy adult subjects with the collection of over 4.5 h of data. The results were very positive, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 88.8%.},

  abstract={The smart city is increasingly gaining worldwide attention. It has the potential to improve the quality of life in convenience, at work, and in safety, among many others' utilizations. Nevertheless, some of the emerging applications in the smart city are computation-intensive and time-sensitive, such as real-time vision processing applications used for public safety and the virtual reality classroom application. Both of them are hard to handle due to the quick turnaround requirements of ultra-short time and large amounts of computation that are necessary. Fortunately, the abundant resource of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can help to address this issue and improve the development of the smart city. In this paper, we focus on the problem that how to schedule tasks for these computation-intensive and time-sensitive smart city applications with the assistance of IoV based on multi-server mobile edge computing. Task scheduling is a critical issue due to the limited computational power, storage, and energy of mobile devices. To handle tasks from the aforementioned applications in the shortest time, this paper introduces a cooperative strategy for IoV and formulates an optimization problem to minimize the completion time with a specified cost. Furthermore, we develop four evolving variants based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the proposed problem: variable splitting ADMM, Gauss-Seidel ADMM, distributed Jacobi ADMM, and distributed improved Jacobi (DIJ)-ADMM algorithms. These algorithms incorporate an augmented Lagrangian function into the original objective function and divide the large problem into two sub-problems to iteratively solve each sub-problem. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have a better performance than the existing algorithms. In addition, the DIJ-ADMM algorithm demonstrates optimal performance, and it converges after approximately ten iterations and improves the task completion time and offloaded tasks by 89% and 40%, respectively.},

Among others, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or systems (UAS) already rely on 5G communication infrastructure and in the near future are envisioned to use it even more. 5G systems already support a wide-variety of different applications, such as remote healthcare, self-driving ground vehicles, virtual or augmented reality, drones, surveillance and many more. Among these is the high-resolution video surveillance using drones for different purposes. In road traffic analysis, one of the most important public safety applications, the low compressed or uncompressed video stream can greatly improve the analysis and traffic incident detection performance. On the other hand it is challenging to transmit high-resolution video stream in real time due to its data size. This paper provides an overview of the current research in the area of UAV command and control using 5G systems describing basic concepts and challenges.

  year={2022},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={In this paper, several algorithms for gate detection in ADR (autonomous drone racing) are compared based on accuracy and speed. These are YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once), PP-YOLO, Faster R-CNN (Region Based Convolutional Neural Network), U-Net, and Lines (an original algorithm introduced in the paper). Two variants of the first three are trained, one that detects entire gates and another that detects gate corners. Each of these produce around 99% sufficiently accurate gate center predictions in average times ranging from 20 to 60 ms per image, with YOLOv5 being the fastest overall. U-Net and Lines were generally less accurate and slower, with U-Net scoring 88.70% accuracy at 109.90 ms per image, and Lines scoring 34.64% accuracy at 67.60 ms per image. The paper is a novel contribution as it is the first to compare object detection, image segmentation, and classical computer vision methods for this task in a controlled manner. The comparison is performed across the same set of training and test data, on the same hardware, and uses a consistent scoring mechanism, yielding more correct and complete results than one based on a review of studies on the individual algorithms. Variations on the studied algorithms have been commonly used in published work on ADR, but not directly compared [1]–[3]. The original Lines algorithm serves as a representative for algorithms employing classical computer vision methods, leveraging simplicity and domain knowledge in hopes of faster speed. It combines edge and line detection with a simple heuristic to find the boundaries of a gate. The algorithms are compared in their “out of the box” states, without modification or optimization, so that the results are generalizable and valuable for both inexperienced users and experienced users who are prototyping. The algorithms predicted the centers and corners of gates that drones navigate through in a race, where each image contained one gate. They were trained and tested using 9,300 images of real gates from the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge ADR competition. Accuracy was measured as the distance between the labelled and predicted gate center and corner locations relative to the apparent size of the gate in the image. A threshold was chosen to consider a prediction sufficiently accurate. Speed was measured as the elapsed wall clock time for prediction on powerful desktop hardware, under the assumption that their relative prediction speed would scale to hardware onboard a drone. The results of this study could facilitate future work in ADR by providing information on the performance of various common gate detection methods. ADR itself is exciting to watch, with rewards for top teams continuing to grow, but ADR also serves as a testbed for cutting edge drone hardware and software. Its advancement will ultimately improve drone technology in the many industries that drones are finding applications, including agriculture, conservation, deliveries, film, and public safety. Additionally, the development of robust gate detection algorithms could influence other applications for object detection where performance is critical, such as in autonomous vehicles, image search, and augmented reality experiences.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are set to become an integral part of 5G and beyond systems with the promise of assisting cellular communications and enabling advanced applications and services, such as public safety, caching, and virtual/mixed reality-based remote inspection. However, safe and secure navigation of UAVs is a key requisite for their integration in the airspace. The GPS spoofing is one of the major security threats to remotely and autonomously controlled UAVs. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based, mobile network-assisted UAV monitoring and control system that allows live monitoring of UAVs' locations and intelligent detection of spoofed positions. We introduce the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the edge UAV Flight Controller (UFC) to locate a UAV and detect any GPS spoofing by comparing differences between the theoretical path loss computed by UFC and the corresponding path loss reported by the connected base station (BS). To reduce the detection latency as well as to increase the detection accuracy, transfer learning is leveraged to transfer the CNN knowledge between edge servers when the UAV handovers from one BS to another. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed solution can successfully detect spoofed GPS positions with an accuracy rate above 88% using only one BS.},

  abstract={In this study we present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to Energy Management Systems (EMSs) for multiple residential microgrids. The EMS is responsible for optimally scheduling end-user smart appliances, heating systems and local generation devices at the residential level, based on end-user preferences, weather-dependent generation and demand forecasts, electric pricing, technical and operative constraints. The core of the proposed framework is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model aiming at minimizing the overall costs of each residential microgrid. At each time step, the computed optimal decision is adjusted according to the actual values of weather-dependent local generation and heating requirements; then, corrective actions and their corresponding costs are accounted for in order to cope with imbalances. At the next time step, the optimization problem is re-computed based on updated forecasts and initial conditions. The proposed method is evaluated in a virtual testing environment that integrates accurate simulators of the energy systems forming the residential microgrids, including electric and thermal generation units, energy storage devices and flexible loads. The testing environment also emulates real-word network medium conditions on standard network interfaces. Numerical results show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={5G networks offer unparalleled data rates and features. However these are still far from what a hyperconnected society and industry needs. Future wireless connectivity Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G will require a smart and green platform that is ultra-fast, highly adaptive, and dependable to support innovative, human-centric applications securely. This is the focus of the EU-funded DEDICAT 6G project, the vision and methodology of which is presented in this paper. DEDICAT 6G investigates enablers for dynamic distribution of intelligence to improve task execution time, energy efficiency, and ultimately, reduce end-to-end latency. The project also examines solutions for dynamic coverage extensions utilizing robots, connected vehicles and drones. The scope also comprises methods for security, privacy, and trust assurance including enablers for novel interaction between humans and digital systems exploiting innovative interfaces and devices, like smart glasses. DEDICAT 6G focuses on four representative 6G use cases: Smart Warehousing, Enhanced Experience, Public Safety and Smart Highway. The developed solutions will be demonstrated and tested in these use cases through experiments in laboratory environments, and larger field evaluations utilizing diverse assets and testing facilities.

  abstract={For the gas–liquid–solid fluidized beds with magnetic catalyst, the solid fraction can be estimated through the reconstructed permeability distribution using the electromagnetic tomography (EMT) based on the tunneling magneto resistance (TMR) sensor. Considering that the existence of mixed phase and obscure phase interface leads to the inaccurate estimation of phase fraction, a new approach to estimating the solid fraction is proposed. Firstly, the equivalent magnetic circuit analysis method is introduced to abstract the magnetic field distribution, and the relationship between the boundary measurement data and the equivalent permeability of the cross section is derived. Then, the effective medium model is employed to estimate the solid fraction of the cross section based on the equivalent permeability. The solid fraction estimation method based on the above proposed method is more accurate than that based on the gray level of reconstructed images, especially when the permeability distribution is complex. When the true solid fraction is in the range of 0%–100%, the average of the absolute error of simulation and experiment is 2.5% and 4.8%, respectively.},

  abstract={Human-computer interaction has been a more popular research field in recent years with the escalating interest in wearable systems. In this context, evaluating the details of the physical movement of the human body has become a prominent subject for researchers. The systems, which are yielded from this subject, are utilized in such areas as health, public safety, access control, and smart home systems. This kind of system is expected to give fast and reliable results and can be used comfortably for the user. In this paper, a fast and accurate system design about recognition of daily human activities, including falls in the elderly, is proposed. In addition, another main objective of the study is to examine whether an accelerometer can be set in different positions during person's daily activities. Motion data have been acquired from the waist, wrist, and knee positions of 5 female and 15 male volunteers using a three-axis accelerometer. In this way, walking, sitting, standing up, jumping, and falling motions were collected from volunteers. The principal component analysis method was used as a feature reduction method to reduce the process time and get quick results. Furthermore, any feature extraction method was not used. The support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, radial basis function, and Naive Bayes classifiers were employed to perform classification success. The proposed technique achieved a maximum of 100%, an average of 96.54% accuracy on the three defined positions. As a result, it has been determined that a single accelerometer can be set in different positions. The findings also suggest that this method can be used in home care and follow-up procedures and fall detection for elderly people.},

  abstract={Alcohol intoxication leads to road accidents, violence, and the deteriorated health of heavy drinkers. Hence, a convenient means to monitor alcohol consumption with an accuracy and selective manner is a demand by law enforcement personnel, service/hospitality industry, or individual drinkers. We report on a label-free, highly sensitive, and selective alcohol immunosensor based on 2D zinc oxide nanoflakes (ZnO-NFs), which were synthesized on gold-coated flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates using a single-step sonochemical process. Selective detection of alcohol was achieved via ethylglucuronide (EtG) detection by immobilizing EtG antibody (EtG-AB) on the as-synthesized sensing electrodes of ZnO-NFs. The 2D ZnO-NFs provide unique sensing advantages over bulk materials. The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrated the sensitivity of 0.032 mA/decade/cm2 in the concentration range of 1 ng/ml to 100 μg/ml which covered the physiological range. The minimum level of detection was determined much lower than 1 ng/ml. Shelf-life studies showed that the presented EtG sensors can be used over two months after the first use without significant performance degradation. Our method and device would help realizing continuous alcohol monitoring in the wearable platform.},

  abstract={Detecting Person-Of-Interest (POI), e.g., fugitives, criminals and terrorists in public spaces is a critical requirement of many law enforcers and police officers. In realty, most law enforcement personnel cannot effectively differentiate POIs from millions of faces and thus demand a portable assistant to recognize faces, in order to take the golden opportunity taking the POIs into immediate custody. Unfortunately, current face recognition systems are stationary and limited to a small scale of POI datasets. In this paper, we investigate a wearable computerized-eyewear based face recognition system. This system is a portable device which can accompany a police officer during patrolling or other tasks. The eyewear is connected to a cloud based face recognition system via wireless networks. Facial images captured by the mounted camera are sent to the cloud for identity retrieval. When the system finds a POI, it would alert officers via overlaying a virtual identity tag on the real POI's face on the transparent screen of the eyewear. We provide approaches to greatly minimize recognition time, including leveraging the large storage and high computational capacities provided by the cloud. The cloud enables nationwide POI database and supports parallel computing for face recognition.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={58578-58595},
  abstract={Surveillance system is acquiring an ample interest in the field of computer vision. Existing surveillance system usually relies on optical or wearable sensors for indoor and outdoor activities. These sensors give reasonable performance in a simulation environment. However, when used under realistic settings, they could cause a large number of false alarms. Moreover, in a real-world scenario, positioning a depth camera at too great a distance from the subject could compromise image quality and result in the loss of depth information. Furthermore, depth information in RGB images may be lost when converting a 3D image to a 2D image. Therefore, extensive surveillance system research is moving on fused sensors, which has greatly improved action recognition performance. By taking into account the concept of fused sensors, this paper proposed a novel idea of a modified K-Ary entropy classifier algorithm to map the arbitrary size of vectors to a fixed-size subtree pattern for graph classification and to solve complex feature selection and classification problems using RGB-D data. The main aim of this paper is to increase the space between the intra-substructure nodes of a tree through entropy accumulation. Hence, the likelihood of classifying the minority class as belonging to the majority class has been reduced. The working of the proposed model has been described as follows: First, the depth and RGB images from three benchmark datasets have been taken as the input for the model. Then, using 2.5D cloud point modeling and ridge extraction, full-body features, and point-based features have been retrieved. Finally, for the efficacy of the surveillance system, a modified K-Ary entropy accumulation classifier is optimized by the probability-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm has been used. In both qualitative and quantitative experimental results, the testing results have shown 95.05%, 95.56%, and 95.08% performance over SYSU-ACTION, PRECIS HAR, and Northwestern-UCLA (N-UCLA) datasets. The proposed system could apply to various real-world emerging applications like human target tracking, security-critical human event detection, perimeter security, internet security, public safety etc.},

  pages={593-605},
  abstract={Multicasting is becoming more and more important in the Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable applications (e.g., high definition video streaming, virtual reality gaming, public safety, among others) that require high bandwidth efficiency and low energy consumption. In this regard, millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can play a crucial role to efficiently disseminate large volumes of data as well as to enhance the throughput gain in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks. There are, however, challenges to face in view of providing multicast services with high data rates under the conditions of short propagation range caused by high path loss at mmWave frequencies. Indeed, the strong directionality required at extremely high frequency bands excludes the possibility of serving all multicast users via a single transmission. Therefore, multicasting in directional systems consists of a sequence of beamformed transmissions to serve all multicast group members, subgroup by subgroup. This paper focuses on multicast data transmission optimization in terms of throughput and, hence, of the energy efficiency of resource-constrained devices such as wearables, running their resource-hungry applications. In particular, we provide a means to perform the beam switching and propose a radio resource management (RRM) policy that can determine the number and width of the beams required to deliver the multicast content to all interested users. Achieved simulation results show that the proposed RRM policy significantly improves network throughput with respect to benchmark approaches. It also achieves a high gain in energy efficiency over unicast and multicast with fixed predefined beams.},

  abstract={Given the fast pace of grid modernization, system states are changing more frequently and rapidly with the high penetration of renewable energy, responsive loads and power electronics interface. To properly monitor the dynamic change of system states and to further improve system operation reliability and robustness, a fast state estimator is required. This paper presents a graph computing-based state estimation. The feasibility of power system graph modeling is first demonstrated. The power system is naturally represented by a graph, in which its nodes serve as both storage units and logic units. Second, a graph computing technique for power system state estimation is presented. The system-level H matrix and gain matrix are decomposed into locally formulated node-based matrices, and these node-based matrices are compressed to improve computational complexity. In addition, with graph topology analysis, the efficiency of the system-level gain matrix formulation and storage are further improved. The testing results of IEEE 14-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, two European systems from MATPOWER, a provincial system in China, an MP-10790 system and an extended IEEE 118-bus*120 system demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed approach without compromising the accuracy. Its advantages for high-performance computation are further illustrated by comparing it against a commercial EMS.},

  abstract={With the prevalence of low-cost imaging devices (smartphones, tablets, camcorders, digital cameras, scanners, wearable, and IoT devices), images and videos have become the main modalities of information being exchanged in every walk of life. The ever-increasing convenience of image acquisition has facilitated instant distribution and sharing of multimedia on digital social platforms. In the meantime, powerful multimedia editing tools allow even unskilled people to easily manipulate digital content for malicious or criminal purposes. In all cases where multimedia serves as critical evidence, forensic technologies that help to determine the origin, the authenticity of multimedia sources, and the integrity of multimedia content become essential to forensic investigators. Imaging devices and post-acquisition processing software leave unique “fingerprints” in multimedia content. This allows many challenging problems faced by the multimedia forensics community to be addressed through source inference. Source inference is the task of linking digital content to the source device or platform (e.g., social media such as Facebook) responsible for its creation. It can facilitate applications such as identification and verification of source device and platform, common source inference, content integrity verification, and source-oriented image clustering. It also allows the establishment of digital evidence or the history of multimedia processing steps applied to the content, starting from the acquisition procedure and up to tracking the spread. The recent adoption of multimedia source inference techniques in the law enforcement sector (e.g., U.K. Sussex Police, Guildford Crown Court, and INTERPOL) in real-world criminal cases and child sexual exploitation databases has manifested the significant value of multimedia source inference in the fight against crime. This Special Section in IEEE Access aims to collect a diverse and complementary set of articles that demonstrate new developments and applications in digital forensics through multimedia source inference.},

The techniques used for these robotic vehicles in the field of sensors, sensor data processing and control offer enormous potential to improve in integrated drive assistance systems the safety aspects of future cars in the streets. The team of the University Wuerzburg was involved in Mars Rover developments for the European Space Agency ESA and transferred similar navigation and tele-operation techniques also to industrial transport rovers and to remotely controlled rovers for harsh environments (by example to support fire fighters in search and rescue operations during emergencies). Related assistance systems support the tele-operator in situation awareness to more reliably detect obstacles and dangers. The vehicle should be able to handle difficult situations autonomously, like obstacle avoidance and a return to the base, in particular when the radio link is lost. Interesting progress in sensor systems (new principles like PMD-camera, future navigation systems like Galileo, ...), in miniaturization, in man-machine interfaces (like augmented reality approaches) and sensor data processing provide here exciting perspectives for innovations. Assistance systems enable a range of scalable reactions, which initiate appropriate actions adapted to the specific situation and to the operatorpsilas skills. As specific example the assistance system of University Wuerzburg will be presented, which was the winner of the ldquourban scenariordquo competition at ELROB 2007, where in a city environment hidden markers were to be detected and identified.},
